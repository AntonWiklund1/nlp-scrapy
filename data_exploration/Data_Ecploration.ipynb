       "'A race to the roof was all that saved them from the deluge.It was like being “in the middle of the sea with massive waves crashing around,” said high school teacher Ahmad al-Sharif, who scrambled to the top of his building with some neighbors as a wall of water swallowed up cars, homes and bodies.In the darkness and faced with a wave of water so large it felt like a “tsunami appearing in front of you,” he recalled, neighbors were screaming as the deluge destroyed the city. Some were shouting “Save us! “Help us!” while others were saying the Shahada, the Islamic affirmation of faith, as the waves crashed over them and pulled them under.\\xa0Al-Sharif, 34, spoke by voice message from a shelter in Derna, the city in eastern Libya that was devastated by last week’s floods.\\xa0“Most of my friends from the neighborhood” have died, he said. “People have been found in their homes. … People have been found in the sea.”'"
