But the absence of Prince William and Kate, the Princess of Wales, after the revelation of her own cancer diagnosis offered a reminder that the royal ranks remain depleted.Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Anglican church, mentioned the king and Kate at the top of his Easter sermon Sunday.Charles III and Queen Camilla greet people after the Easter Service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor CastleHollie Adams, WPA Pool / Getty Images“In each of our lives there are moments which change us forever,” Welby said. “Sometimes it’s individual. We have watched, sympathized with and felt alongside the dignity of the king and the Princess of Wales as they have talked of their cancer — and in doing so, by their lack of selfishness, by their grace and their faith, boosted so many others.”Charles is undergoing regular treatment and has stepped back from public engagements on medical advice, though he has continued to carry out many of his duties behind closed doors.Officials have not disclosed what form or stage of cancer he has.On Thursday, he delivered his first public remarks since Kate announced she had become the second senior royal to be diagnosed with cancer, stressing the importance of friendship, “especially in a time of need.”The recorded audio message was heard at a traditional Maundy Thursday service at Worcester Cathedral, in the city of the same name around 130 miles northwest of London.Charles said Jesus set an “example of how we should serve and care for each other” and how “we need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us, especially in a time of need.”Although he did not address his daughter-in-law’s health directly or name her in his brief personal message, some royal watchers interpreted his words in the context of the ongoing family health crisis.The king’s public relations team also released a new picture of the smiling monarch sitting at a desk in Buckingham Palace’s 18th Century Room, apparently recording his address into a microphone.Charles has spoken of how touched he is by the outpouring of messages and cards from well-wishers from across the United Kingdom and beyond as he undergoes treatment for cancer.In a statement after Kate revealed her diagnosis March 22, he said he had become closer to his daughter-in-law through their shared hospital stays. The king was “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did,” it added.Kate said in a video statement that she was undergoing “a course of preventative chemotherapy” on the advice of her medical team.She did not specify what type of cancer she has or at what stage it was found, and Kensington Palace, the couple’s royal household, has not said why the operation was necessary.Inside palace doors, the shock of her diagnosis “was immense,” NBC News royal contributor Katie Nicholl told “TODAY” on Friday.“Kate’s cancer diagnosis was kept was within a very, very, very tight group of people,” Nicholl said. “It was William, it was the king, it was Camilla and of course Kate’s family. But I do know that while Queen Camilla knew, she didn’t even tell her own children.”William, Kate and their children — George, 10, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, 5 — attended the Easter Sunday service last year, but Kate asked for privacy in her personal video message announcing her diagnosis.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CAMEMBERT, France — On a tiny farm tucked into the lush, green hillside of Normandy, Aude Sementzeff heats raw milk from cows up the hill until it curdles, then scoops it into molds to make a round, pearly white Camembert cheese.For eight years, Sementzeff has been making the earthy, soft cheese in small batches to be sold in Paris stores, continuing a tradition that dates to the 18th century. So ubiquitous is Camembert in France that soldiers in the trenches of World War I ate it as part of their daily rations.“Camembert is there at each step of our history,” Sementzeff, 41, said as she delicately salted each cheese and flipped it to perfect its rind. “So there is a strong link, I think, with French culture.”But now this notoriously pungent delicacy is in trouble, as is brie, another celebrated French cheese enjoyed across the world.The National Centre for Scientific Research, France’s state-run science agency, has warned that Camembert, brie and even blue cheeses “could disappear,” owing to a decline in the strains of fungi that give the beloved cheeses their unique taste, smell, color and texture.“Blue cheeses may be under threat, but the situation is much worse for Camembert, which is already on the verge of extinction,” the research center wrote in a memo in January.While many cheesemakers insist the problem isn’t quite that dire, they acknowledge that producing cheeses like Camembert is getting harder, a consequence in part of past efforts to engineer the perfect block. Scientists refer to fungi’s role in cheesemaking as “delicious rot,” and it’s a critical part of the arduous process of making a Camembert, which includes several weeks of aging. It can be added early on with other enzymes when milk is heated to form curds, or sprayed on the cheese later to help the ripening process and promote the soft, white rind prized by Camembert-lovers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON — A group of artists set to compete in this year’s Eurovision Song Contest said Friday they “do not feel comfortable being silent” in light of the ongoing Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip, but stopped short of heeding growing calls for a boycott of the music competition over Israel’s participation.The joint statement — from the entrants who will represent Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — comes a little more than a month before this year’s edition of the pop extravaganza in May. The competition is being held in the Swedish city of Malmo, which said earlier this month that it was prepared for possible protests.The presence of Israel, which is competing with the song “Hurricane” by Eden Golan, has loomed over the buildup to the competition and fueled calls for the country to be kicked out of the contest. However, the European Broadcasting Union, which runs the event, has allowed Israel to participate after changing the title and lyrics of its entry, which were originally deemed to violate the contest’s rules about remaining nonpolitical.“We want to begin by acknowledging the privilege of taking part in Eurovision. In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent,” the artists’ joint statement said. “It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages. We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.”Eden Golan, Israel's representative at the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv earlier this month.Carlos Garcia Rawlins / Reuters / ReduxThe statement added: “We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.”The statement came a day after an open letter by a group of LGBTQ+ artists, musicians, writers and activists called on British entrant Olly Alexander to boycott the competition. Alexander has had international success as part of the band Years &amp; Years, and is among the most high-profile acts at this year’s competition. The BBC, the United Kingdom's public broadcaster, which chooses the British entry, distanced itself from the letter. “These are the views of Olly Alexander. He is not speaking for the BBC,” it said in a statement.The group of more than 450 artists and activists under the banner Queers for Palestine had posted the open letter Thursday saying “We ask you to heed the Palestinian call to withdraw from Eurovision.” The group accused the EBU of  “providing cultural cover and endorsement for the catastrophic violence that Israel has unleashed on Palestinians.”Alexander also posted his own response Friday to the Queers for Palestine letter. “As a participant I’ve taken a lot of time to deliberate over what to do and the options available to me. It is my current belief that removing myself from the contest wouldn’t bring us any closer to our shared goal,” he said.Irish entry Bambie Thug, who uses they/them pronouns, added a further statement posted on their Instagram account, “As an Irish person with a shared history of occupation and a queer individual, I cannot and will not remain silent.”Saying they were aware of calls to withdraw from the contest, Bambie Thug said that “stepping back now would mean one less pro-Palestinian voice at the contest. My heart and solidarity has and always will lie with the oppressed, and I remain committed to supporting and using my platform to raise awareness and advocate for change.”Bambie Thug said they \"cannot and will not remain silent.\"Gareth Cattermole / Getty Images fileThe EBU said in a statement: “We understand that these artists wish to make their voices heard in a call for peace. All of us working on this year’s Eurovision Song Contest are mindful of the strong feelings and opinions surrounding the current conflict in the Middle East. We have all been impacted by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those caught up in this devastating war.”The Israeli broadcaster KAN declined to comment and the Israeli Culture and Sports Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on Friday. When announcing the revised Israeli entry earlier this month, a KAN spokesperson cited Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s desire to have the nation compete in Eurovision. “The president emphasized that at this time in particular, when those who hate us seek to push aside and boycott the state of Israel from every stage, Israel must sound its voice with pride and its head high and raise its flag in every world forum, especially this year.\"</td>\n",

The king did not address his daughter-in-law’s health directly or name her in his brief personal message on Thursday. But royal watchers may interpret his words in the context of the ongoing family health crisis.He also delivered a Bible reading.The king did not appear in person at Thursday’s event — instead Queen Camilla deputized for him.

The monarch hands out specially made coins in white and red purses to 75 men and 75 women to reward them for good deeds such as charity work, a reference to the king’s age. Camilla performed that role on Thursday.The event symbolizes the Last Supper, when Jesus washed the feet of disciples the day before Good Friday. The custom dates back to 600 A.D. and the coins have been in use since 1662, when Charles II distributed Maundy money.Charles attended last year’s service at York Minster, following a tradition set by Queen Elizabeth II to hold it in different places across the U.K., not just in London.The king continues to work behind the scenes while receiving treatment for cancer. On Tuesday, he met community and faith leaders from the Windsor Leadership charity at Buckingham Palace, and he continues to hold a weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, albeit on at least one occasion by phone.</td>\n",

But the absence of Prince William and Kate, the Princess of Wales, after the revelation of her own cancer diagnosis offered a reminder that the royal ranks remain depleted.Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Anglican church, mentioned the king and Kate at the top of his Easter sermon Sunday.Charles III and Queen Camilla greet people after the Easter Service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor CastleHollie Adams, WPA Pool / Getty Images“In each of our lives there are moments which change us forever,” Welby said. “Sometimes it’s individual. We have watched, sympathized with and felt alongside the dignity of the king and the Princess of Wales as they have talked of their cancer — and in doing so, by their lack of selfishness, by their grace and their faith, boosted so many others.”Charles is undergoing regular treatment and has stepped back from public engagements on medical advice, though he has continued to carry out many of his duties behind closed doors.Officials have not disclosed what form or stage of cancer he has.On Thursday, he delivered his first public remarks since Kate announced she had become the second senior royal to be diagnosed with cancer, stressing the importance of friendship, “especially in a time of need.”The recorded audio message was heard at a traditional Maundy Thursday service at Worcester Cathedral, in the city of the same name around 130 miles northwest of London.Charles said Jesus set an “example of how we should serve and care for each other” and how “we need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us, especially in a time of need.”Although he did not address his daughter-in-law’s health directly or name her in his brief personal message, some royal watchers interpreted his words in the context of the ongoing family health crisis.The king’s public relations team also released a new picture of the smiling monarch sitting at a desk in Buckingham Palace’s 18th Century Room, apparently recording his address into a microphone.Charles has spoken of how touched he is by the outpouring of messages and cards from well-wishers from across the United Kingdom and beyond as he undergoes treatment for cancer.In a statement after Kate revealed her diagnosis March 22, he said he had become closer to his daughter-in-law through their shared hospital stays. The king was “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did,” it added.Kate said in a video statement that she was undergoing “a course of preventative chemotherapy” on the advice of her medical team.She did not specify what type of cancer she has or at what stage it was found, and Kensington Palace, the couple’s royal household, has not said why the operation was necessary.Inside palace doors, the shock of her diagnosis “was immense,” NBC News royal contributor Katie Nicholl told “TODAY” on Friday.“Kate’s cancer diagnosis was kept was within a very, very, very tight group of people,” Nicholl said. “It was William, it was the king, it was Camilla and of course Kate’s family. But I do know that while Queen Camilla knew, she didn’t even tell her own children.”William, Kate and their children — George, 10, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, 5 — attended the Easter Sunday service last year, but Kate asked for privacy in her personal video message announcing her diagnosis.   \n",

So ubiquitous is Camembert in France that soldiers in the trenches of World War I ate it as part of their daily rations.“Camembert is there at each step of our history,” Sementzeff, 41, said as she delicately salted each cheese and flipped it to perfect its rind. “So there is a strong link, I think, with French culture.”But now this notoriously pungent delicacy is in trouble, as is brie, another celebrated French cheese enjoyed across the world.The National Centre for Scientific Research, France’s state-run science agency, has warned that Camembert, brie and even blue cheeses “could disappear,” owing to a decline in the strains of fungi that give the beloved cheeses their unique taste, smell, color and texture.“Blue cheeses may be under threat, but the situation is much worse for Camembert, which is already on the verge of extinction,” the research center wrote in a memo in January.While many cheesemakers insist the problem isn’t quite that dire, they acknowledge that producing cheeses like Camembert is getting harder, a consequence in part of past efforts to engineer the perfect block. Scientists refer to fungi’s role in cheesemaking as “delicious rot,” and it’s a critical part of the arduous process of making a Camembert, which includes several weeks of aging. It can be added early on with other enzymes when milk is heated to form curds, or sprayed on the cheese later to help the ripening process and promote the soft, white rind prized by Camembert-lovers.   \n",
       "2    LONDON — A group of artists set to compete in this year’s Eurovision Song Contest said Friday they “do not feel comfortable being silent” in light of the ongoing Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip, but stopped short of heeding growing calls for a boycott of the music competition over Israel’s participation.The joint statement — from the entrants who will represent Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — comes a little more than a month before this year’s edition of the pop extravaganza in May. The competition is being held in the Swedish city of Malmo, which said earlier this month that it was prepared for possible protests.The presence of Israel, which is competing with the song “Hurricane” by Eden Golan, has loomed over the buildup to the competition and fueled calls for the country to be kicked out of the contest. However, the European Broadcasting Union, which runs the event, has allowed Israel to participate after changing the title and lyrics of its entry, which were originally deemed to violate the contest’s rules about remaining nonpolitical.“We want to begin by acknowledging the privilege of taking part in Eurovision. In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent,” the artists’ joint statement said. “It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages. We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.”Eden Golan, Israel's representative at the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv earlier this month.Carlos Garcia Rawlins / Reuters / ReduxThe statement added: “We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.”The statement came a day after an open letter by a group of LGBTQ+ artists, musicians, writers and activists called on British entrant Olly Alexander to boycott the competition. Alexander has had international success as part of the band Years & Years, and is among the most high-profile acts at this year’s competition. The BBC, the United Kingdom's public broadcaster, which chooses the British entry, distanced itself from the letter. “These are the views of Olly Alexander. He is not speaking for the BBC,” it said in a statement.The group of more than 450 artists and activists under the banner Queers for Palestine had posted the open letter Thursday saying “We ask you to heed the Palestinian call to withdraw from Eurovision.” The group accused the EBU of  “providing cultural cover and endorsement for the catastrophic violence that Israel has unleashed on Palestinians.”Alexander also posted his own response Friday to the Queers for Palestine letter. “As a participant I’ve taken a lot of time to deliberate over what to do and the options available to me. It is my current belief that removing myself from the contest wouldn’t bring us any closer to our shared goal,” he said.Irish entry Bambie Thug, who uses they/them pronouns, added a further statement posted on their Instagram account, “As an Irish person with a shared history of occupation and a queer individual, I cannot and will not remain silent.”Saying they were aware of calls to withdraw from the contest, Bambie Thug said that “stepping back now would mean one less pro-Palestinian voice at the contest. My heart and solidarity has and always will lie with the oppressed, and I remain committed to supporting and using my platform to raise awareness and advocate for change.”Bambie Thug said they \"cannot and will not remain silent.\"Gareth Cattermole / Getty Images fileThe EBU said in a statement: “We understand that these artists wish to make their voices heard in a call for peace. All of us working on this year’s Eurovision Song Contest are mindful of the strong feelings and opinions surrounding the current conflict in the Middle East. We have all been impacted by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those caught up in this devastating war.”The Israeli broadcaster KAN declined to comment and the Israeli Culture and Sports Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on Friday. When announcing the revised Israeli entry earlier this month, a KAN spokesperson cited Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s desire to have the nation compete in Eurovision. “The president emphasized that at this time in particular, when those who hate us seek to push aside and boycott the state of Israel from every stage, Israel must sound its voice with pride and its head high and raise its flag in every world forum, especially this year.\"   \n",

The king did not address his daughter-in-law’s health directly or name her in his brief personal message on Thursday. But royal watchers may interpret his words in the context of the ongoing family health crisis.He also delivered a Bible reading.The king did not appear in person at Thursday’s event — instead Queen Camilla deputized for him. Charles has stepped back from public engagements on medical advice.The king’s public relations team also released a new picture of the monarch sitting at a desk in Buckingham Palace’s 18th Century Room, apparently recording his address into a microphone.Charles has spoken of how touched he is by the outpouring of messages and cards from well-wishers from across the United Kingdom and beyond as he undergoes treatment for cancer, the exact type and stage of which the palace has not disclosed.The king released a statement after Kate revealed her diagnosis last Friday, saying that he had become closer to his daughter-in-law through their shared hospital stays.The king was “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did,” the statement said.The Royal Maundy service is part of the king’s role as the head of the Anglican Church. The monarch hands out specially made coins in white and red purses to 75 men and 75 women to reward them for good deeds such as charity work, a reference to the king’s age. Camilla performed that role on Thursday.The event symbolizes the Last Supper, when Jesus washed the feet of disciples the day before Good Friday. The custom dates back to 600 A.D. and the coins have been in use since 1662, when Charles II distributed Maundy money.Charles attended last year’s service at York Minster, following a tradition set by Queen Elizabeth II to hold it in different places across the U.K., not just in London.The king continues to work behind the scenes while receiving treatment for cancer. On Tuesday, he met community and faith leaders from the Windsor Leadership charity at Buckingham Palace, and he continues to hold a weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, albeit on at least one occasion by phone.   \n",

The spill, covering several square kilometers, poses a severe threat to marine life and the ocean's fragile ecosystem. PetroGlobal has yet to release a statement, but environmentalists are calling this one of the worst ecological disasters of the decade.   \n",

Satellite images confirm that AgriCorp Industries is behind the clearing of thousands of hectares of forest land to make way for agricultural expansion. This deforestation not only disrupts biodiversity but also contributes significantly to climate change. Activists demand immediate action to halt AgriCorp's activities.   \n",
