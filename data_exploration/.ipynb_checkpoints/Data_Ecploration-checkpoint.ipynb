Satellite images confirm that AgriCorp Industries is behind the clearing of thousands of hectares of forest land to make way for agricultural expansion. This deforestation not only disrupts biodiversity but also contributes significantly to climate change. Activists demand immediate action to halt AgriCorp's activities.\n",

The environmental agency is investigating the incident, while ChemiTech faces widespread backlash over its safety practices.\n",
