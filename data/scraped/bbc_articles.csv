0,Binance crypto boss Changpeng Zhao sentenced to 4 months in prison,"The founder of the world's largest crypto exchange has been sentenced to four months in prison in the US for allowing criminals to launder money on his platform. Changpeng Zhao resigned from Binance in November and pleaded guilty to violating US money laundering laws. Binance was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions. Prosecutors had sought a three-year sentence for the former Binance boss. At a sentencing hearing on Tuesday in Seattle, Judge Richard Jones said Zhao put ""Binance's growth and profits over compliance with US laws and regulations"", according to the Verge. US officials said in November that Binance and Zhao's ""wilful violations"" of its laws had threatened the US financial system and national security. ""Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform."" Commonly called ""CZ"", Zhao has a $33 billion fortune, according to Forbes magazine. Nigerian authorities are currently investigating the company, registered in the Cayman Islands, as well. Tigran Gambarayan, who is in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance, denied money laundering charges in a Nigerian court in early April. Fellow executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, detained in Nigeria alongside Mr Gambarayan in February, escaped custody in March . Zhao's sentencing comes shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud committed at his rival crypto platform, FTX. Widely known as the ""crypto king"", Bankman-Fried was found to have stolen billions from customers ahead of the firm's failure . The Justice Department said its investigation into Binance also found the exchange made it easy for criminals to move money.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68930465,tech
1,Meta faces EU probe over Russian disinformation,"The European Commission has opened formal investigation proceedings into Meta over its handling of political content, including a suspected Russian influence campaign. With elections looming in the EU and elsewhere, officials said they would assess whether the company's approach to moderating disinformation on Facebook and Instagram breached EU law. Among the Commission's concerns is Meta's oversight of its advertising tools, and whether they had been exploited by ""malicious actors."" The probe will also examine whether Meta is being transparent enough over its moderation of political content and accounts. “We have a well-established process for identifying and mitigating risks on our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement. ""We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.” The company is one of several tech firms designated ""very large online platforms"" (VLOPs) under the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA). VLOPs face fines of up to 6% of their annual turnover if they do not meet tougher content moderation requirements. This includes taking action to prevent manipulation of elections and disinformation. The Commission says it suspects Meta's current methods for moderating disinformation and political adverts do not comply with DSA obligations. It is concerned about the impact this may have on the upcoming electoral cycle, with the European Parliament elections taking place in June. ""This Commission has created means to protect European citizens from targeted disinformation and manipulation by third countries,"" said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""If we suspect a violation of the rules, we act. This is true at all times, but especially in times of democratic elections."" The four concerns at the heart of the EU Commission's investigation are: Ineffective oversight and moderation of adverts Lack of transparency over demotion of political content and accounts Journalists and civil society researchers having no easy access to real-time data or tools to monitor political content during elections Lack of clear and easy ways for users to report illegal content A European Commission official said it believed Meta's current approach to moderating advertisements did not meet DSA requirements. It cited findings by non-profit research organisation, AI Forensics, that a Russian influence campaign had been running adverts across the firm's platforms. AI Forensics said it uncovered a network of 3,826 pages spreading ""pro-Russian propaganda"" and the campaign had reached 38 million users between August 2023 and March 2024. It said less than 20% of the ads had been moderated by Meta as political. Meta says it has been taking action against the ""Doppelganger"" campaign since first exposing it in 2022 and it now sees less user engagement as a result. The Commission has given the firm five days to respond to a request for information about tools for journalists and researchers to monitor content on Facebook and Instagram during upcoming elections. It said it was concerned by Meta's approach to CrowdTangle - a public tool providing data and insights into Facebook and Instagram content engagement. The firm announced in March that it will no longer be available from 14 August, but says it is building new tools to provide wider access to platform data. The EU Commission's investigation follows its launch of a similar probe into disinformation on X (formerly Twitter) in March .",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72p1dr0mk8o,tech
2,Hacker jailed for blackmailing therapy patients,"One of Europe's most wanted cyber criminals has been jailed for attempting to blackmail 33,000 people whose confidential therapy notes he stole. Julius Kivimäki obtained them after breaking into the databases of Finland's largest psychotherapy company, Vastaamo. After his attempt to extort the company failed, he emailed patients directly, threatening to reveal what they had told their therapists. At least one suicide has been linked to the case, which has shocked the country. Kivimäki has been sentenced to six years and three months in prison. In terms of the number of victims, his trial was the biggest criminal case in Finnish history. One of them gave their reaction to the BBC. ""The main thing is that this absolutely empathy-lacking, ruthless criminal gets a prison sentence"", said Tiina Parikka. ""After this there rise thoughts about how short the conviction is, when reflected against the number of victims"", she added. ""But, that's the Finnish law and I must accept that."" The 26-year-old had maintained his innocence - despite going on the run and being arrested in Paris under a fake identity. During the trial, he also went missing for more than a week after refusing to be recalled back to prison by the court. The judges found him guilty of all counts, describing his blackmail as ""ruthlessly taking advantage of another person's special weakness."" ""Taking into account Vastaamo's position as a company producing mental health services, Kivimäki has caused great suffering or the risk of it to the interested parties,"" the verdict document said. The verdict brings to an end a cyber crime spree that started when he was just 13 years old. Kivimäki, known online as Zeekill, was a key member of multiple teenage cyber gangs which caused chaos between 2009-2015. He was arrested in 2013, at the age of 15, and given a juvenile non-custodial two-year suspended sentence. At the time, cyber experts were worried his punishment would fail to deter him - and he was quickly linked to many more hacks carried out with teen gangs before disappearing for years. His name was quickly linked to the Vastaamo hack of 2020 after experts pointed to  Kivimäki traits in the attack. He demanded a 400,000 Euro (£340,000) ransom from the company. When it refused, he emailed thousands of patients asking for 200 Euros and threatening to publish their notes and personal details on the darknet which he did anyway in full. But it was a mistake that the hacker made himself that led police to a treasure trove of information found on a server that Kivimäki owned. Unprecedented digital forensics and cryptocurrency tracking also helped secure the conviction. Tiina Parikka recalls receiving the email from him saying that he had her therapy notes. She told the BBC it caused her to relapse into mental health problems that the therapy had initially helped her overcome. “So many people were affected by this in so many ways,"" she said. The boss of Vastaamo, Ville Tapio, was also convicted of failing to protect his customers' sensitive data. Investigations found that the databases were vulnerable and open to the internet without proper protections. He was given a suspended three-month prison sentence last year. The company which was once a highly regarded and successful business in Finland collapsed after the hack. Despite the conviction, the Vastaamo case is not over as civil court cases are now likely to begin in an attempt to get some of the victims compensation for the hack.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c97znd00q7mo,tech
3,Bumble boss: What women in tech can learn from me,"Not many chief executives in tech are the daughter of a mechanic and a cleaner. But Lidiane Jones, the boss of the online dating app, Bumble, says that is not what really marks her out: it is the fact she is not a man. ""It's still not an equitable journey for women today"", she tells me of her path from her modest upbringing in São Paulo, in Brazil, to the boardroom. If anyone wants to follow in her footsteps, she says, they need to turn the obstacles in business and tech that women continue to face to their advantage. ""My biggest advice is use this resilience that we have to build, especially as women, because opportunities are harder,"" she says. ""It's not necessarily an easy or linear journey. I've had to really be resourceful."" Ms Jones brings more than 20 years of technical expertise in software engineering and product management to the role. But despite having already been vice-president at Sonos and chief executive of Slack, she says the path to success for women in the technology sector is often riddled with hurdles and setbacks - not least the lack of representation. ""I definitely have been in many situations in recent years where I was the only woman in the room,"" Ms Jones says. ""But I'm really using this as a platform to ensure that I'm not the only woman in the room anymore."" Ms Jones cites the support of a network of other female leaders, including Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, as a source of inspiration and encouragement. ""The number of CEO women that are out there that have reached out, that have welcomed me into their small but mighty group, has been phenomenal,"" she says. Encouraging women to back themselves, Ms Jones says: ""Don't self-doubt. ""Don't waste any energy on that - just believe in yourself and take a leap."" Bumble styles itself as a female-friendly app - it is the woman who has to ""make the first move"" before two users can connect. It is attempting to take that further with a feature that allows female users to set a question to which their matches can respond. The big question for Bumble though is whether this tinkering can turn its fortunes around. Shares in the dating app have fallen by two-thirds since its 2021 initial public offering, with its value now closer to $4bn (£3.2bn). And its largest institutional shareholder, Blackstone, recently offloaded a 10% stake at the heavily discounted price of $300m. There is intense competition within the $7bn dating market, which continues to be dominated by established players such as Match Group, known for its acquisition of rising contenders, including Hinge. It seems Ms Jones will have to keep beating the odds if Bumble is to avoid things going stale.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68907647,tech
4,Analogue technology can be frustrating – is that part of the appeal?,"Digital technology's quickness and convenience ought to have buried its analogue counterparts. Yet vinyl records and film photography endure. Why do people continue to use it? I finally locate the legendary Schneiders Buero , a shop selling analogue synthesizers in Berlin's Kotti neighbourhood. Up two flights of stairs, the music machinery on offer includes brands such as Moog and Buchla, as well as modern euro-racks. Each set-up contains headphones and boxes of patch cables. There are no instructions and the machines, while alluring, are also somewhat imposing. (From Michael's fieldnotes) As academics who rarely go a day without playing or making music, we have spent the past decade examining the extraordinary revival of analogue technology . From vinyl records to film cameras, all manner of apparently written-off technologies have been making a comeback, including modular synthesizers – one of the earliest types of this now-ubiquitous electronic instrument. In the UK, some six million vinyl LPs were bought in 2023, an 11.7% rise on the previous year's sales and the 16th straight year of increase. The vinyl revival is also fuelling a resurgence of independent record shops , with UK high streets now having a third more (around 461 stores ) than a decade ago. Certainly, the stereotype of vinyl listeners being older men no longer holds water. Taylor Swift now accounts for one in every 15 vinyl albums sold in the US – and was a reason for some of the Record Store Day queues in the UK in 2023. Contemporary musicians such as Lana Del Ray, Tyler, The Creator, Olivia Rodrigo and Kendrick Lamar also out-vinyl the likes of Metallica, who themselves sell so much of their music on vinyl that they bought their own vinyl pressing plant to ensure supply. Such has been the revival in analogue synthesizers that venerable brands including Korg and Moog have relaunched lower-priced modules aimed at novices, while also reviving older classics for the pros. This means there are now more analogue options available than at any time since the 1970s, the heyday of the modular format. Synthesizer-based music events by new brands such as Teenage Engineering are packed with young and middle-aged enthusiasts eager to play with Kraftwerk-inspired pocket calculator synths that can produce a surprising array of sounds. My [Michael's Berlin] visit was one of many experiences that sought to explain why so many consumers choose these so-called ""difficult"" technologies , when far simpler and more convenient options exist. Is the difficulty of learning to use these old devices actually the point? I tentatively connect two modules. Nothing. I suddenly realise I've been at this for two hours. Feeling somewhat dazed, I look around the shop. Many of those who began using the machines at the same time as me are still locked in thought, their machines covered in patch cords. I keep going, and eventually sounds start to emerge. (From Michael's fieldnotes) When Phil Oakey, frontman of 80s synth-pop pioneers The Human League, mentioned in a 2011 interview that a new ""analogue moment"" was happening, we wondered whether this increased interest in obsolete formats would be a passing fad, or something more enduring. Regardless, we dived in anyway. Michael bought a USSR-produced Lomo LC-A camera (introduced in 1984 and still manufactured today in China), a vinyl record player with plastic needles that destroyed a few records, and some small synth modules by Korg that are targeted at interested amateurs rather than professional musicians. Eventually, these forays became our formal research project , which has included visiting record fairs and conventions around the world, going on photowalks and attending listening evenings, and meeting an array of diehard analogue communities both on and off line. In 2018, Giana co-wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review titled The Growing Business of Helping Customers Slow Down , highlighting the growing appetite for "" consumer deceleration "" – and associated concepts such as ""slow shopping"" and the provision of ""quiet rooms"" in some high-street stores. We see the facilitation of deceleration as beneficial for individual wellbeing, the environment, and businesses alike. And we expect interest in such experiences to rise exponentially in coming years. Recognising our existential need to occasionally slow down can be the basis for winning consumer strategies. (Giana) Giana's article predicted a future that more of us are now acknowledging. In December 2023, the Observer newspaper called vinyl albums – together with a slowly brewed, ""drip"" filter coffee – the ""antidote to a frenetic digital world"". This point was echoed by many of the people we have interviewed about ""the appeal of the slow"", including Naomi*, who had recently begun experimenting with a 19th-Century-style camera. ""I like the pace of it, it really slows you down. Your options to take pictures are really limited – you've only got two-to-six shots, and the film and processing are expensive. It's also very labour-intensive getting that shot from inside the camera to print, so you're really conscious of getting it right. If you make a mistake at the beginning, you can invest a few days and it's still going to be a rubbish shot. You're not going to fire off 1,000 pictures like digital, and that really appeals to me."" According to a 2018 global photography survey , by film producer Ilford Photo, just under a quarter of people shooting on film – including many under the age of 40 – had never used this medium before. Rather than nostalgia, they are turning to film because of its aesthetic values and a greater sense of creative control over their photos. Globally, while the film camera market is still very niche, it's growing fast . In response, brands including Kodak, Polaroid and Leica have re-emerged – in some cases, almost from the dead. Legendary instant camera maker Polaroid was rescued by the Austrian entrepreneur Florian Kaps , whose Impossible Project organisation purchased the company's last factory in the Netherlands days before it was due to close. Kaps explained to us: ""We had just built and discovered an exponentially growing customer group of new-generation instant photographers, so we had to fight for this very last chance to keep this medium alive! We literally saved it from demolition at the very last second in 2008."" From its base in downtown Vienna, the Impossible Project now offers consumers and commercial clients everything from large-scale Polaroid portraits to local handcrafted wines, and even lessons in sourdough breadmaking and block-based printmaking. Elsewhere, interest in analogue has been sustained across a range of categories, from the growth of board games to letter writing and the resilience of physical books. Members of the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Scientists are also analogue fans, judging by the best cinematography nominees in the 2024 Oscars. While movies shot on film remain a small proportion of film releases overall, four out of the five cinematography nominees were shot on Kodak movie film stock (Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Poor Things, and Maestro). Although digital filmmaking has some clear advantages over analogue , especially when it comes to post-production and distribution, the most common mistake is to suggest it's more cost-effective. In 2018, Kodak's then-global marketing director, Steven Overman, discussed this with us in relation to Oppenheimer's director, Christopher Nolan, who is a well-known champion of shooting on film. ""One of the big myths of film is that it's more expensive than digital – but that's not really true if you're a disciplined filmmaker. When a filmmaker's shooting ratios are off the charts, a lot of post-production needs to be done. But a film like Dunkirk actually did not shoot that high a volume of film, because Chris Nolan is such a disciplined filmmaker – he knows exactly what he wants to capture in the shot. Shooting film by definition requires more discipline."" Overman also noted that in sectors such as fashion, commercial photographers using film are earning more than those who use digital, largely because they are able to stand out in a market saturated with technically great work. He said luxury brands such as Gucci are particularly keen on using film photography as this gives their promotional material a different look. Many of the photowalks Michael has been on end in a pub with arguments over the relative merits of digital and film. After one such walk, James, a former teacher of photography, commented on a film photograph of a fox visiting a backyard late at night to feed on nuts. When it was conceded that digital probably was better for wildlife photography, James cut in: ""That's to miss the point! Quality-wise, there's no doubt – but you'd miss all the preparation. It's like going to watch a band versus listening to a CD at home. The sound might be better but you miss seeing the work that went into the performance, the effort of the players and their crew."" Work, effort, meaning – these ideas are all interconnected for users and consumers of analogue technology. Whereas work is often seen as a means to an end, from earning a living to exercising, ""analoguers"" get a buzz out of the processes of setting things up, getting things right, trial and error, and building up skills. This ""love of the process"" was backed up by another photographer, Dan, during a Zoom discussion held amid one of the Covid lockdowns: ""When I'm serious, I don't want to get distracted by what [image] I'm going to end up with. Even with instant photography, I know I'm going to see the shot soon – just not now. I love everything up until pressing the shutter. I love searching for the frame, I like the output, but the whole process is important."" Yet none of the people we've interviewed are analogue purists. These vinyl lovers mostly also have Spotify lists; film photographers will sometimes take out their phone to capture material quickly; and modular synth fans often have tablets full of apps to replicate sounds on the go. However, when asked to compare the two , they talk about the greater weight and meaning they give to their analogue experiences. Vinyl listeners often tell us they feel more engaged with the music and have developed a deeper experience with the artist. Paul, for instance, described his relationship with one beloved vinyl record: ""The one [vinyl track] that will always make me cry is Aretha Franklin's A Natural Woman . It's scratched to hell but there's something about the warmth that comes from it, which enables something that's not present – something added. I think it is the quality of the human voice; it does feel more like someone's speaking to me."" For Paul, the particular audio quality of a vinyl recording – and even the damage from having played this record so many times – is all part of his relationship with this song. And part of what makes this possible is the process of analogue recording, in which all the sounds being made, including the unscripted noise of the recording process itself, are captured in the final track. To facilitate this sound, some musicians have even started setting up their own pressing plants, such as Jack White's Third Man Pressing in Detroit. For there is another side to the analogue revival that is anything but planned. Whether making music, film or visual arts, ""happy accidents"" facilitated by restrictive analogue technology can lead to creative inspirations. The term is widely used in electronic pop music to refer to unexpected or unplanned outcomes that arise from the imperfections in analogue equipment, as John, a Melbourne-based musician and 80s music aficionado, explains: ""Half of what you do trying to make music is like a happy accident that ends up sounding better than what you intended. If the machine doesn't do exactly what you thought it was going to do, or goes a bit out of tune, it is all part of the process. Your mistakes or accidents become part of what you are trying to do, rather than you thinking: ‘Oh, I will erase that and do it again properly.' You get a little bit of randomness in it, and that randomness can add to what you are trying to achieve."" Or as Rusty Egan, former member of early synth-pop band Visage and co-founder of the ground-breaking New Romantic club Blitz in London's Covent Garden, puts it: ""Don't give up the possibility of accidents!"" Egan, always renowned for his forthright opinions, once made that memorable plea when he took to the stage for a DJ set in 2011. Later that evening, he explained what he meant: ""The DJs that just finished, they're great – but they use Ableton [computer software] to smooth out the transitions between songs. This makes it all perfect – too perfect. There's no possibility of mistakes. When we started, we didn't have that technology, so we made mistakes and some of them were happy accidents, resulting in iconic tracks. Remember the slightly out of tune 'duh duh' on Tainted Love? Dave Ball was just learning to play and loved the sound. He put Marc Almond's great voice over it, and you have perfection."" The revival of film-based photography is partly driven by the same sensibility. The Vienna-based Lomography organisation – established in 1992 by a group of students as an arts movement to promote the taking of spontaneous and experimental photos – espouses such things as the ""joy of light leaks "" typical of cheap Chinese and Soviet-made plastic cameras, generating all sorts of interesting creative outcomes. Indeed, rule number nine of Lomography's 10 golden rules highlights the accidental nature of shooting on film rather than a digital camera – and even the lovely surprise of getting your developed film delivered back from the processing laboratory: So you get a roll of film back from the lab. Who is that person? What's that swirl of light flickering across the image? How did the colours turn out like that? Or what about that accidental double exposure – how the hell did that happen? What was I even trying to shoot there? It's these happy accidents that we love. (Michael) The grainy nature of film, the crackling sound of vinyl, and the propensity for analogue synths to go out of tune or suffer from power surges can all be key elements in the cultural resonance of art and music. So too human imperfections, which seem to be more common among analogue recordings. For example, the opening bass part of Cannonball , the 1993 song by US Indie band The Breeders, accidentally starts in a different key. Bass player Josephine Wiggs began playing the riff one step down, then fixed it when the drums came in. And in Roxanne , the Police's 1978 single, the song begins with an accidental piano chord followed by lead singer Sting's laughter, prompted by him having accidentally sat on the piano keys. Similarly, many of Mick Rock's legendary music photographs , such as the cover of Lou Reed's album Transformer , are technically very grainy because he was shooting in low light and ""pushing"" the film to its limits , but as a result, they have a painterly feel that has enhanced their appeal and power. Over the decade or so of our research, explanations for the analogue revival have shifted from nostalgia to the desire for something physical in a digital age, to the sense that analogue technology is creatively preferable. The idea that working within limits, and needing to overcome them, is beneficial to art creation is now accepted by many within the creative sectors. Is digital technology de-skilling consumers, leading to a sense of alienation? And is this overcome by using more difficult analogue devices? This is the conclusion we have come to. Certain types of ""serious leisure"", including sports and creative activities, provide us with intrinsic joy even if they are frustrating to engage in until skills are developed. Using analogue technology is another way consumers can feed this desire to re-skill. In a sense, while analogue users feel they have greater control over their creativity, this occurs through surrendering to the demands of one's device – along the lines of German electronic legends Kraftwerk's menschmaschine (Man-Machine) philosophy . This runs contrary to the promise of most consumer-driven innovation: functional superiority and increased ease of use. In Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling debut book The Tipping Point , consumers who embrace new technology are seen as the innovators while the slowest to adopt are the laggards, often because of a lack of means to afford the latest innovation. But the analogue, ""anti-tech"" revival can also be seen as a new form of status consumption, given the costs associated with use, repair, chance of failure, time to learn, and the physical space necessary for storage. The analogue revival is driven by people wanting to be active rather than passive consumers. The more they engage in the work required by analogue technologies, the more control they gain in shaping their desired experiences – first by learning the rules, then in their skilled application, and then, ultimately, in breaking the rules, generating happy accidents to be shared with like-minded others. Rob is the founder of a website originally devoted to The Human League, which eventually became a platform for electronic music and, for a brief time, a record label. Having been dormant for a long period, suddenly the website began celebrating vinyl in a big way. Rob told us how his love of music had turned sour with the ""sheer ease"" of digital, starting with CDs and the MP3 player – and how vinyl had reinvigorated him. ""I would never listen to the album all the way through on an MP3, so it all became a bit disjointed. It was too easy – I was getting bored. I wasn't getting pulled into music as much as what I remembered … With vinyl, it's made me look at bands I never would have considered on CD at all."" For Rob, the problem came when listening on digital devices which didn't have the ""sides"" of vinyl albums, and then listening on music streaming platforms which have digital algorithms to preference popular tracks. Much of the joy of listening to music lay in discovering unsung album track gems and single B-sides . In our research, we distinguish between analogue ""craftspeople"", who have spent hours mastering the rules of their technology, and ""designers"" who go further. These are the people who want to stretch and break the rules and trigger the happy accidents that create something altogether new. For example, photographers who seek more creative expressions by pre-soaking or ""souping"" their camera film in lemon juice, coffee, beer, or even burning it. And among this group, connecting digital and analogue technology is also common – combining two completely different systems to generate even more possibilities. Film director Denis Villeneuve's first instalment of Dune (2021) was initially shot on digital, then transferred to film , before being re-digitised. Why? Villeneuve says he felt that digital-only would have been ""too harsh"" for a movie in which texture and nature play an important role. But at the same time, for a story set in the year 10191, relying solely on film would have given too much of a nostalgic feel. By combining the two, Villeneuve got a film that, in his words, has a ""more timeless, painterly feel"". He pushed this idea even further for Dune: Part Two (2024), with many of the scenes being shot using vintage Soviet-era Helios-44 lenses to create the dreamlike ""bokeh"" effect . In I Dream of Wires , a 2014 documentary about the return of analogue synthesizers, Chris Carter, a former member of the industrial music pioneers Throbbing Gristle, explains the attraction of mashing up analogue and digital technology: ""I'm happy to combine analogue and digital [synth] modules. You can have modules that sample and manipulate those sounds, filters that do crazy things, and combining all those things together you get sounds you couldn't imagine before. You can use all these mixtures of manufacturers and designs and the slightest thing that you do on one can have the greatest effect on something else further along in that chain."" In 2022, legendary producer T Bone Burnett and Bob Dylan revealed they had been recording songs using a new kind of analogue, aluminium disc that, according to their announcement, ""possesses a depth, resonance and sonic fidelity that exceeds that of vinyl, CD, streaming or any other means of experiencing recorded music"". While this project was very much geared towards rich collectors, with the re-recording of Dylan's hit single Blowin' in the Wind subsequently selling for $1.85m (£1.48m) at auction, it suggests analogue music technology may yet have more innovations in store for us. There is, however, another reason for the growing popularity of this old and difficult technology. Recently, there has been much hand-wringing about the role of humans in the creation and consumption of art forms, especially with the widespread availability of AI-generated art and music. Nick Cave, when sent the lyrics of a song generated by Open AI's chatbot ChatGPT ""in the style of Nick Cave"", wrote back in January 2023: ""This song sucks."" And he said a lot more besides, including that songs arise out of suffering and ""data can't suffer"": ""ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn't have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend."" Cave, like many of our interviewees, highlights the importance of having limits to overcome as part of any human creative process. Because analogue privileges real people in the making of art, it may become ever more culturally important as an antidote to the burgeoning use of AI. Or as Cave puts it: ""This is what we humble humans can offer that AI can only mimic – the transcendent journey of the artist who forever grapples with his or her own shortcomings."" -- *Some names in this article have been changed to protect the anonymity of the interviewees. *Michael Beverland is professor of brand management at the University of Susses Business School *Giana M Eckhardt is professor of marketing at King's College London This article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence. -- For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter , while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240426-why-we-continue-to-embrace-analogue-tech,tech
5,The ghosts of India's TikTok: What happens when a social media app is banned,"TikTok was one of India's most popular apps – until it was banned in 2020. It's a lesson for what might unfold if a US ban goes ahead. Four years ago, India was TikTok's biggest market. The app boasted a growing base of 200 million users, thriving subcultures and sometimes life-changing opportunities for creators and influencers. TikTok seemed unstoppable – until simmering tensions on the border between India and China erupted into deadly violence. After the border skirmish, the Indian government banned the app on 29 June 2020 . Almost overnight, TikTok was gone. But the accounts and videos of Indian TikTok are still online, frozen in time when the app had just emerged as a cultural giant. In some ways, it could offer a preview of what might lie on the horizon in the United States. On 24 April, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that could ultimately ban TikTok from the US , marking a new chapter after years of threats and failed legislation. The law requires the company that owns TikTok, Bytedance, to sell its stake in the app within the next nine months, with a further three-month grace period, or face a potential ban in the country. Bytedance says it has no intention of selling the social media platform and has vowed to challenge the legislation in court. Banning a massive social media app would be an unprecedented moment in American tech history, though the looming court battle currently leaves TikTok's fate uncertain. But the Indian experience shows what can happen when a major country wipes TikTok from its citizen's smartphones. India is not the only country to have taken the step either – in November 2023, Nepal also announced a decision to ban TikTok and Pakistan has implemented a number of temporary bans since 2020. As the app's 150 million US users swipe through videos in limbo, the story of India’s TikTok ban shows that users are quick to adapt, but also that when TikTok dies, much of its culture dies with it. Sucharita Tyagi , a film critic based in Mumbai, had grown her account to 11,000 followers when TikTok came down, with some of her videos racking up millions of views. ""TikTok was huge. People were coming together all over the country, dancing, putting up skits, posting about how they run their homestead in their small town in the hills,"" says Tyagi. ""There was a massive number of people who suddenly had this exposure that they had always been denied, but now it was possible."" The app was a particular phenomenon because of the ways its algorithm gave opportunities to rural Indian users , who were able to find an audience and even reach celebrity status not possible on other apps. ""It democratised content creation for the first time,"" says New Delhi-based technology writer and analyst Prasanto K Roy. ""We began to see a lot of these very rural people fairly low down on the socio-economic ladder who would never dream of getting a following, or making money on it. And TikTok's discovery algorithm would deliver it to users who wanted to see it. There was nothing quite like it in terms of hyper-local videos."" TikTok holds a similar cultural significance in the US, where niche communities flourish and an untold number of small creators and businesses base their livelihood around the app. It's a kind of success that's less prevalent on other social media platforms. Instagram, for example, is generally tuned more for consuming content from accounts with big followings, while TikTok places a heavier emphasis on encouraging regular users to post. When TikTok went offline in India, the government banned 58 other Chinese apps along with it, including some that are currently growing in popularity in the US today, such as the fashion shopping app Shein . As the years rolled on, India banned over a hundred more Chinese apps, though negotiations recently brought an Indian version of Shein back online. The same could happen in the US. The new law sets a precedent and creates a mechanism for the American government to get rid of other Chinese apps. The privacy and national security concerns politicians voice about TikTok could apply to a host of other companies as well. And when a popular app is removed, others can attempt to fill the gap. ""As soon as TikTok was banned it opened up a multibillion-dollar opportunity,"" says Nikhil Pahwa, an Indian tech policy analyst and founder of the news site MediaNama . ""Multiple Indian start-ups launched or pivoted to fill the gap."" For months, the Indian technology press was flooded with news about these buzzy new Indian social media companies, with names Chingari, Moj and MX Taka Tak . Some found initial success, luring former TikTok stars onto their platforms and securing investments and even governmental support. It splintered the Indian social market into different corners as the new apps battled for dominance, but that post-TikTok gold rush didn't last long. In August 2020, Instagram launched a short-form video feed called Reels , just months after the TikTok ban. YouTube followed suit with Shorts , its own copycat TikTok functionality, a month later. Instagram and YouTube were already entrenched in India, and the field of new start-ups didn't stand a chance. ""There was a lot of buzz around alternatives to TikTok, but most faded away in the long run,"" says Prateek Waghre, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation , an Indian advocacy group. ""In the end, the one that benefited the most was probably Instagram."" For many of Indian TikTok's bigger creators and their fans, it wasn't long before they moved to Meta and Google's apps, and many found similar success. For example, Geet , an Indian social media influencer who only goes by her first name, rose to full-blown stardom on TikTok teaching ""American English"" and giving life advice and pep talks. She had 10 million followers across three accounts by the time TikTok was banned. In a 2020 interview with the BBC , Geet shared concerns about the future of her career. But four years later, she's gathered nearly five million followers across Instagram and YouTube. However, the users and experts the BBC spoke to say something was lost in the post-TikTok transition. Instagram and YouTube may have snatched up TikTok's traffic, but the apps didn't recreate the feeling of Indian TikTok. ""TikTok was a comparatively different kind of user base as far as creators go,"" says Pahwa. ""You had farmers, and bricklayers, and people from small towns uploading videos on TikTok. One doesn't see that as much on YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. TikTok's discovery mechanism was very different."" If TikTok is banned in the US, the American social media landscape may follow a similar path to India's. Four years after the ban, Instagram and YouTube have already established themselves as a home for short videos. Even LinkedIn is experimenting with a TikTok-style video feed. The app's competitors have proven they don't need to recreate TikTok's culture to find success. It's possible, if not likely, that America's hyper-local and niche content would vanish, just like it did in India. In fact, the cultural ramifications on the US would be far more significant. Nearly one-third of Americans aged 18-to-29 get their news from TikTok , according to the Pew Research Center. The US has fewer TikTok users than the 200 million India had in its prime, but India is home to 1.4 billion people. TikTok reportedly has 170 million users in the US, more than half the country's population. ""When India banned TikTok, the app was not the behemoth that it is now,"" says Tyagi. ""It has turned into a cultural revolution over the last few years. I think banning it now in America would have a much larger impact."" What's already different is TikTok's response. The company has vowed a legal battle over the US government's new law, a fight that may wind its way up to the US Supreme Court. TikTok could have launched a similar legal challenge to India's ban, but chose not to. ""Chinese companies have good reason to be hesitant to go to courts in India against the Indian government,"" says Roy. ""I don't think they would find them to be very sympathetic."" India's ban was also immediate, taking effect in a matter of weeks. TikTok's upcoming legal challenge in the US could tie up the law for years, and there is no certainty that the legislation will stand up to a battle in the courts . There's also a far greater chance a US TikTok ban would spark a trade war. ""I think there's a distinct possibility of reciprocity from China,"" says Pahwa. China condemned India for banning TikTok , but there wasn't any overt retaliation. The US may not be so lucky. More like this: There are numerous reasons for China's response to the Indian ban. One is the fact that India's tech industry is essentially non-existent in China. America's tech industry, on the other hand, offers plenty of opportunities for a reciprocal attack. China has already launched an effort to "" delete America "" and replace US technology with domestic alternatives. A TikTok ban could ramp up that project. ""The TikTok ban was so sudden when it happened,"" says Tyagi. ""For me it wasn't that big of a deal, I was just using the app to promote my other work. But it felt weird and unfair to a lot of people, especially people who were actually making money and getting brand deals."" Losing TikTok didn't affect Tyagi's livelihood, but it did cut her off from her account. That is, until she took a trip to the US. ""When I visited America and l was surprised to see my profile was still active,"" says Tyagi. It was like a trip back in time. She even posted a few videos. Most of her followers back home couldn't see them of course, but she got a little engagement from Indians living abroad. ""All these millions of accounts are still there,"" Tyagi says. ""It's interesting to see that TikTok kept them. I wonder if they're hoping India will let them come back."" -- For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter , while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240426-the-ghosts-of-indias-tiktok-social-media-ban,tech
6,World's biggest 3D printer whirs into action,"A giant 3D printer, which is big enough to make a house, has been unveiled at the University of Maine. The university says it has beaten its own record for the world's largest polymer 3D printer - with the new printer four times bigger than the previous machine. The Factory of the Future 1.0 (FoF 1.0) can print objects 96ft (29m) long - approximately the length of a blue whale. But experts say, despite the breakthrough, most of us will continue to live in homes made of bricks and mortar. Large 3D printers, such as that unveiled in Maine, are more like to be used to make parts of houses rather than full homes, says Dr Eujin Pei, who is an expert in additive manufacturing at Brunel University. He says they can be used for historical restoration, ""not to print a house, but sometimes to print decorative parts, or sometimes to restore some parts."" They may become useful after natural disasters to manufacture parts of destroyed buildings, he told the BBC. The University of Maine says it hopes the printer can be used to make affordable housing, as well as bridges, boats and wind turbines. It can print up to 500lbs (227kg) of material per hour. While 3D printers often print using plastic, the university hopes to include more sustainable materials and prioritise recycled polymers. Maine is also home to large forests - and the hope is to use residual wood from sawmills as material to feed into the printer. ""The downside is that those kind of materials are not so durable,"" says Dr Pei. Wood is ""not so robust, but it's more environmentally friendly,"" he says. The 3D printing process saves on time and waste by only using the materials needed, but there are still some environmental impacts. ""Sometimes the materials being used are not fully being able to be recycled because of contamination"" in the production process, Dr Pei adds. However, as products are designed on a computer first, their energy efficiency can be calculated beforehand - and they can be printed in a way which takes less time. ""There are definitely cost savings with respect to energy efficiency [and] resource efficiency,"" says Dr Pei. Partly funded by the US military, the giant printer in Maine uses ""sensors, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence"" to help manufacture large products, said Habib Dagher, who is head of the university's Advanced Structures and Composites Center. FoF 1.0's record-breaking predecessor built a bungalow as a prototype, but the hope is to help solve Maine's housing shortage with the new FoF 1.0. It also used wood as a material which was fed into the manufacturing process. The university says the two printers can work together in manufacturing the same object too. It has long been hoped that 3D printing will transform manufacturing, both large and small scale. It has been used in a wide range of fields, from space rockets to human cells to puppets. But it also has a dark side - with criminals using the technology to manufacture weapons. Last year, in what was thought to be the first case of its kind in the UK, two men were jailed for making sub-machine guns using a 3D printer. Later in 2023, a man in Birmingham was sentenced to five years in prison for making 3D-printed assault rifles.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx7d34nl5vwo,tech
7,Google accused of making it harder to search for rival,"Google has been accused of taking advantage of its market dominance to make it harder to search for a rival email service. Tuta Mail - which says it has more than ten million users worldwide - alleges that, since March, it hasn’t appeared prominently in Google searches for “encrypted email."" The company has made a complaint to the EU claiming that Google - which has its own hugely popular Gmail service - has damaged a rival business. Google has denied the accusation, insisting Tuta remains ""easily accessible"" via its search engine. In its complaint, Tuta notes that its “ranking” – how high up Google’s search results it appears - fell dramatically in March 2024 for searches such as ""secure email."" As a result, monthly visits to pages on its website have dropped by almost 90%, Tuta's formal complaint to the EU alleges. ""At the beginning of March 2024 Google suddenly stopped displaying our website for thousands of keywords,"" it wrote in the complaint. Following the change, traffic to its website only came from searches mentioning the name of its products. “Google must stop this unfair limitation of showing our website in search results immediately,” Matthias Pfau, co-founder of Tuta Mail said. Google's algorithm uses a number of factors to determine the ranking of search results. When the algorithm is updated, it can have a big impact on businesses that rely on the visits search sends to their websites. There was an update in early March, as a result of which Google warned there would be more fluctuations in rankings than usual. But it denies its updates are intended to favour any particular website, including its own. ""Search ranking updates absolutely do not aim to preference Google products, or any other particular website. The email provider in question is easily accessible globally on Search,"" Google wrote. Gmail has more than a billion users worldwide. Tuta argues that “niche” email services such as its own will not be able to grow into serious competitors if they don’t appear for common search terms. In a blog post the firm accused the company of breaching a new EU law that came into force in March, which designated some large firms, including Google, as “gatekeepers” subject to additional legal restrictions. This includes not treating their own services more favourably than rivals. “Google in its role as a gatekeeper is impacting the profits and marketability of our private email service Tuta Mail - a direct competitor to Google's Gmail, which goes against the Digital Markets Act”, the company wrote. But, according to a Google spokesperson, Tuta ranks above Gmail for a range of email-related searches, including ones that don't mention it as a brand and those it referred to in its blog.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckv7jz9x1l9o,tech
8,US TikTok ban: When and why could the app be outlawed?,"TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance. The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of users' data and its links to the government in Beijing. Lawmakers from both major US political parties have called for a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell the app to a non-Chinese company. They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government. The House of Representatives and Senate have now both approved a $95bn (£76bn) foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan which also contained a bill paving the way for the forced sale of TikTok. The legislation has been signed into law by President Joe Biden . Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed. Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020. But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook. Although Mr Biden has signed the bill into law, it does not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok. The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect. That means that the sale deadline would most likely come some time in 2025, after the winner of the 2024 presidential election takes office. If Mr Trump wins, he may seek to block the ban from being implemented. TikTok has vowed to fight the forced sale in the courts, which could take years. The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices. App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. TikTok has called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech. ""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told users in a video , ""we aren't going anywhere"". He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk. ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move. Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban. Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work. In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill. But the deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired . Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation. It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears . At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You. The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app. This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral. Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system. This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing. But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117,tech
9,Meta AI spending plans cause share price slump,"Shares in Meta - the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram - fell sharply after it announced higher than expected spending on artificial intelligence (AI). They went down more than 15% in after-hours trading in New York despite the tech giant revealing strong earnings figures. Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would take some time before its huge AI investment increased revenues. Meta also said its X rival, Threads, now has more than 150 million monthly active users, increasing the pressure on the Elon Musk-owned platform. ""Threads is well on its way to beating X by becoming the Twitter alternative users and advertisers are longing for,"" said Mike Proulx, from analysts Forrester. He also said Meta stood to gain from TikTok's possible sale or ban in the US - a development the app has vowed to fight . Meta has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools to boost earnings growth. It has also been introducing more AI features on its social media platforms such as chat assistants. The firm said it now expected to spend between $35bn and $40bn, (£28bn-32bn) in 2024, up from an earlier prediction of $30-$37bn. For investors, that outweighed the positive news on earnings. First quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46bn, while analysts had expected earnings of $36.16bn. Analysts though said there was a logic to Meta's approach. Sophie Lund-Yates, from Hargreaves Lansdown, said Meta's ""substantial investment"" in AI has helped it get people to spend time on its platforms, so advertisers were willing to spend more money ""in a time when digital advertising uncertainty remains rife"". More than 50 countries are due to have elections this year, she said, ""which hugely increases uncertainty"" and can spook advertisers. Ms Lund-Yates said that ""looking further ahead, the biggest risk [for Meta] remains regulatory"". Last year, Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) by Ireland's data authorities for mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the US. And in February of this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced blistering criticism from US lawmakers and was pushed to apologise to families of victims of child sexual exploitation. Ms Lund-Yates added that the firm has ""more than enough resources to throw at legal challenges, but that doesn’t rule out the risks of ups and downs in market sentiment"".",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl40v5x483yo,tech
10,Tesla profits slump by more than a half,"Tesla has announced its profits fell sharply in the first three months of the year to $1.13bn (£910m), compared with $2.51bn in 2023. It caps a difficult period for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, which - faced with falling sales - has announced  thousands of job cuts. Boss Elon Musk remains bullish about its prospects, telling investors the launch of new models would be brought forward. Its share price has risen but analysts say it continues to face significant challenges, including from lower-cost rivals. The company has suffered from falling demand and competition from cheaper Chinese imports which has led its stock price to collapse by 43% over 2024. Figures for the first quarter of 2024 revealed revenues of $21.3bn, down on analysts' predictions of just over $22bn. But the decision by Tesla to bring forward the launch of new models from the second half of 2025 boosted its shares by nearly 12.5% in after-hours trading. It did not reveal pricing details for the new vehicles. However Mr Musk made clear he also grander ambitions, touting Tesla's AI credentials and plans for self-driving vehicles - even going as far as to say considering it to be just a car company was the ""wrong framework."" ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor,"" he said. Such sentiments have been questioned by analysts though, with Deutsche Bank saying driverless cars face ""technological, regulatory and operational challenges."" Some investors have called for the company to instead focus on releasing a lower price, mass-market EV. However, Tesla has already been on a charm offensive, trying to win over new customers by dropping its prices in a series of markets in the face of falling sales. Tesla cuts prices in major markets as sales fall It also said its situation was not unique. ""Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs,"" it said. Despite plans to bring forward new models originally planned for next year the firm is cutting its workforce. Tesla said it would lose 3,332 jobs in California and 2,688 positions in Texas, starting mid-June. The cuts in Texas represent 12% of Tesla's total workforce of almost 23,000 in the area where its gigafactory and headquarters are located. However, Mr Musk sought to downplay the move. ""Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California!"" he said in a post on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. Another 285 jobs will be lost in New York. Tesla's total workforce stood at more than 140,000 late last year, up from around 100,000 at the end of 2021, according to the company's filings with US regulators. The car firm is also facing other issues, with a struggle over Mr Musk's compensation still raging on. On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge. The judge found Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the firm by awarding Mr Musk the pay-out. Due to the fall in Tesla's stock value, the compensation package is now estimated to be around $10bn less - but still greater than the GDP of many countries. In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday .",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72pvz18x4lo,tech
11,"Three-year-olds groomed online, charity warns","Sexual predators are grooming children under six into performing “disturbing” acts of sexual abuse via phones or webcams a charity has warned. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said it had discovered more than two thousand remotely filmed child abuse images of three to six-year-olds online in 2023. If follows recent warnings from the communications watchdog Ofcom that almost a quarter of children aged five to seven have a smartphone of their own . Responding to the report Security Minister Tom Tugendhat urged tech firms to do more to prevent abuse. He also called on parents ""to speak to your children about their use of social media, because the platforms you presume safe may pose a risk”. The IWF is a charity which helps detect and remove child sexual abuse imagery online. New analysis published in its latest annual report revealed it had discovered 2401 images of children aged three to six in so-called “self-generated” images on the open internet in 2023. “Self-generated” images are where a child is persuaded, coerced or tricked by a predator into carrying out acts via a webcam or handheld device. Nearly one in seven images were category A - the rating it assigns to those featuring the most serious abuse. Six in 10 images showed “sexual posing with nudity” it suggested. Analysts who reviewed some of the images found many, “were are taken at home in children’s bedrooms or in family bathrooms when the child is alone or with another child such as a sibling or friend”. Sometimes children were “completely unaware” they were being recorded. IWF analysts were confident that someone else was directing what happened as three to six-year-old children “are sexually naive and would not normally be aware of the possibility of this type of sexual behaviour,” it said. The report also notes that online child abuse material is more “extreme” with the charity reporting a  22% increase in category A imagery. Ofcom's research suggested a third of parents whose five to seven-year-olds browse social media are allowed to do so alone. Ian Critchley, who leads on child protection for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said protecting young children was not just the responsibility of parents and carers. ""The biggest change"" needed to come from the tech companies and online platforms, he said. As part of its work implementing the new Online Safety Act the communications watchdog has said it will consult on how automated tools, including AI, can be used to ""proactively detect"" illegal content - including child sexual abuse material. But the IWF is calling for swift action and argues technology firms should not wait. ""The harms are happening to children now, and our response must be immediate,"" its chief executive Susie Hargreaves said. AI is already used by some big tech firms to help identify content that violates its terms, including child abuse material. This is principally used to help identify material that is then reviewed by human moderators. But experts warn AI alone is not a panacea. Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey told the BBC: ""AI may prove useful in helping with the scale of the data being analysed but at its current state of development it shouldn’t be considered a complete solution.""",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx9wezr1d1vo,tech
12,EU may suspend money-for-views TikTok feature,"The European Commission could suspend the TikTok Lite rewards programme, which pays users to spend time on the app, as soon as this Thursday. Commissioner Thierry Breton said the feature is ""toxic and addictive"", particularly when used by children. TikTok has until Wednesday to defend the rewards programme, or it could be suspended as early as Thursday 25 April. TikTok told the BBC it was disappointed with the decision. ""We stand ready to trigger... interim measures including the suspension of the TikTok Lite reward programme,"" said European Commissioner Thierry Breton in a post on X, formerly Twitter . In addition, the Commission has opened formal proceedings against the social media company to assess whether it has broken EU law. Under EU law which came into force last year, large platforms like TikTok have to produce a risk assessment before they make large changes to their products. The Commission asked for TikTok's risk assessment into the Task & Rewards programme last week, but says the social media company failed to submit it in time. It has said that the system risks ""serious damage for the mental health of users"". TikTok launched its ""Task and Rewards"" programme last week in France and Spain. It is a new feature on TikTok Lite, a slimmed-down version of the main social media app, which uses less data and space on users' phones. Under the programme, users can earn the equivalent of a few pence per day for watching videos and engaging on the app. The Commission is investigating whether this could have negative effects on the mental health of users, including children, ""especially as a result of the new feature stimulating addictive behaviour"". TikTok says rewards are only open to people over the age of 18, and tools are in place to verify their ages. But the Commission suspects a ""lack of effective age verification mechanisms"". TikTok has no plans to roll the feature out beyond France and Spain as it stands. It is also available in some countries in southeast Asia. This is the second formal investigation into TikTok launched in the EU. In February, the Commission opened formal proceedings against the social media company, investigating whether it broke rules around data protection, protection for children and policing harmful content. At the time, TikTok said it would cooperate with the investigation and continued to work with experts in online safety. Under the EU's Digital Services Act , companies can be fined up to 6% of global revenue. In a statement issued to the BBC, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""We are disappointed with this decision - the TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks. We will continue discussions with the Commission.""",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ez1zzmmjzo,tech
13,Daniel Dennett: 'Why civilisation is more fragile than we realised',"Before his recent death, the influential philosopher Daniel Dennett spoke to the BBC about his lifelong quest to understand human experience – and why he saw new dangers from AI. The philosopher Daniel Dennett, who died at the age of 82 on 19 April, was among the sharpest and most prophetic minds of the last half-century. Throughout his life, he dared to tackle some of the biggest questions about the human mind and consciousness. His career saw him publish over a dozen books, make major contributions to fields ranging from cognitive science and philosophy of mind to evolutionary theory, and become an ardent advocate for rationality and scepticism. In December 2023, I spoke to him for several hours about his recent memoir, I've Been Thinking , as well as his life and work. He was still passionately engaged with the questions of truth, cognition and technological possibility that first fascinated him as a doctoral student at Oxford in the 1960s – and still willing to pick a fight in the service of rigorous thought. In particular, our conversation focused on the grave risks posed by artificial intelligence. His warning was not of a takeover by some superintelligence, but of a threat he believed that nonetheless could be existential for civilisation, rooted in the vulnerabilities of human nature. ""If we turn this wonderful technology we have for knowledge into a weapon for disinformation,"" he told me, ""we are in deep trouble."" Why? ""Because we won't know what we know, and we won't know who to trust, and we won't know whether we're informed or misinformed. We may become either paranoid and hyper-sceptical, or just apathetic and unmoved. Both of those are very dangerous avenues. And they're upon us."" Science fiction philosophy To understand Dennett's argument about AI – and what made him such a deep and original thinker – it's worth looking back to one his most unusual academic papers. In 1978, he published Where Am I? , which took the form of a science fiction short story featuring his own brain in a vat. ""Several years ago,"" the story begins, ""I was approached by Pentagon officials who asked me to volunteer for a highly dangerous and secret mission."" Thanks to an accident during a classified research project, a drilling device bearing an atomic warhead had got stuck a mile underground, beneath Tulsa, Oklahoma. They needed him to help retrieve it. More precisely, they needed his body. In order to avoid the neuron-damaging radiation being emitted by the device (plausibility isn't a necessary feature of philosophical science fiction), his brain would be surgically removed and hooked up by radio transceivers to his body. He could then remotely control it without risking exposure. The question behind Dennett's delightful fantasy was this: assuming the procedure succeeded, and his brain continued to control his body and receive inputs via its sensory organs, where would Daniel Dennett be ? In the story, he imagines his body walking into the room where his brain floats within a reinforced vat, then sitting down and looking at it. The scene was recreated for television in a 1988 documentary by Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos – in which Dennett played himself (with gusto). It's surely one of the only cases of an academic paper receiving such an adaptation. ""Well, here I am sitting on a folding chair, staring through a piece of plate glass at my own brain,"" the flabbergasted Dennett declares. ""But wait… shouldn't I have thought, 'Here I am, suspended in a bubbling fluid, being stared at by my own eyes'?"" The second of these thoughts proves even harder to maintain than the first. And the thought that follows from this is that it's impossible ever to be certain where ""I"" am – or even what the word ""here"" means – purely on the basis of personal experience. ""How did I know where I meant by 'here' when I thought 'here'?"" he continues. ""Could I think I meant one place when in fact I meant another?"" No matter what he may believe about his own location or mental state, such beliefs offer no special guarantee of their own accuracy. The external view of events, not the internal, is the one that matters: the facts on the ground, not how this ground appears to the person standing upon it (or floating in a vat, as the case may be). Contrary to centuries of philosophical tradition, he proposed, we have no special knowledge about the working of our own minds – while the sense that our ""self"" is a unified, coherent entity is merely a marvellous, evolved illusion. As he put it in I've Been Thinking , ""there is little I can know for sure from single-handedly introspecting my own mind."" But there is much to be learned by ""studying the minds of others scientifically"" – so long as this entails a rigorous scepticism about even the most plausible of intuitions. The truth won't free you from cognitive constraint, because no such thing is possible. But it may, if you're careful, teach you about the kinds of freedom worth wanting. This brings us back to a technology uncannily capable of inverting the scenario at the heart of ""Where Am I?"": generative AI. It has the capacity to conjure convincing human simulacra from trillions of bytes of data; and, by doing so, to upend centuries of assumptions around truth, identity and our shared experiences of reality. Given just 30 seconds of moderate quality video, for example, freely available AI services can now create an artificial version of any speaker – or a wholly fictional person – and have them say anything whatsoever. Leaders like the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have already used AI tools to create versions of themselves speaking fluently in regional languages , the better to win votes, with similar approaches being deployed in Indonesia and Pakistan . In July 2023, crude deepfake videos of female opposition leaders in Bangladesh , purporting to show them in bikinis and swimming pools, were rapidly debunked but still shared widely. And much more is coming our way . With 2024 set to be the biggest year for elections in history (no less than half the world's population will be visiting various polls), it has never been easier for the information influencing human decision-making to be manipulated – or for our everyday intuitions and inclinations to be subverted. Indeed, there's every reason to think that, with enough data, it might soon be possible to create a convincing facsimile of a person: an entity who could conceivably pass for a politician – or you or me – not only in a pre-recorded performance but also in everyday conversation. Presciently, Dennett imagined this scenario decades ago. In the science fiction story in Hoenderdos's documentary, scientists create an extra Dennett: alongside the original brain in a vat, his mind is duplicated as a ""digital twin"". They compete to gain control of his body. In this scenario, the question of whether someone actually is somewhere – or has said or done something, or even exists – becomes even more fraught. To see how close reality has already come to fiction, consider the case of the Luciano Floridi Bot , an AI-driven imitation of another leading philosopher of technology, ""designed to answer questions and write texts emulating Floridi's ways of thinking and his style of writing"". It's both a fascinating pedagogical tool and a case study of how, in an age of AI, our ideas and our identities can literally start to take on lives of their own. For Dennett, there was something troubling about the very fact of our obsession with human-seeming AI. While complete facsimiles of the human mind may not be imminent, the way we're using AI to impersonate human beings has, he told me, already put us on a dangerous trajectory. He called such AIs ""counterfeit people"", and told me that rolling out such entities en masse constituted ""mischief of the worst sort"": a form of ""social vandalism"" that should be addressed by law. Why? Because, if convincing digital representations of humans can be created at whim, the entire business of collectively assessing other people's claims, experiences and actions is put at risk – not to mention essential social infrastructure such as contracts, obligations and consequences. Hence the need for legal prohibitions, a case he made at length in a May 2023 article for The Atlantic. ""It won't be perfect,"" he told me, ""but it will help if we can make it against the law to make counterfeit people. We can have stiff penalties for counterfeiting people, same as we do for counterfeit money… we should make it a mark of shame, not pride, when you make your AI more human."" There's an irony, here, in the fact that Dennett spent decades arguing against those trying to carve out some elusive category of ""humanness"" that only our minds can possess. A thoroughgoing materialist, he repeatedly made the case that, as he put it in his 1995 exploration of evolutionary theory, Darwin's Dangerous Idea,""all the achievements of human culture – language, art, religion, ethics, science itself – are themselves artifacts… of the same fundamental process that developed the bacteria, the mammals, and Homo sapiens . There is no Special Creation of language, and neither art nor religion has a literally divine inspiration."" More like this: Humanity's emergence from unthinking matter is marvellous, he argued, but not miraculous. Even minds as remarkable as ours are ultimately the products of an assortment of uncomprehending modules, themselves composed of cruder components, connected in unbroken sequence to the first forms of life. It follows from this that, in principle, there is nothing preventing the algorithms of artificial intelligence from approaching or exceeding our own capacities; or from humans augmenting and re-engineering their minds through artificial means. Indeed, some of Dennett's most important early work entailed defending computation's power and potentials against those who, like the philosopher John Searle , claimed that mere calculation could never give rise to phenomena like consciousness. For Dennett, there was nothing ""mere"" about calculation or algorithmic processes: it was only ever a question of scale and complexity. In this sense, the achievements of modern AIs – from their linguistic prowess and mastery of games like chess and Go to their ability to pass legal and medical examinations – are an ongoing vindication of Dennett's insistence that human-level competence can arise from wholly uncomprehending processes (not to mention that, in our case, it did). During our conversation, however, he was also at pains to highlight the gulf between current computational architectures and humans' analogue complexities. It's dangerous to obsess over whether AI will achieve ""general intelligence"", with all the cognitive flexibility of a human being, let alone something greater. Long before anything like this happens, he noted, we will need to deal with the emergence of ""extremely manipulative"" autonomous agents – and these will pose a far greater threat than hypothetical superintelligences (""forget about that!""). Why? Because, much as social media has proved an evolutionary hothouse for content able to exploit human vulnerabilities, the same dynamics favour both AI-generated content and AIs able to deploy an enticing combination of persuasion, seduction, shock and flattery. From flawlessly glamorous artificial influencers to deepfake pornography, from endlessly empathetic companions to romantic scams, human loves and longings are a fertile field for the refinement of manipulation. We may not (yet) be brains in vats. But what we see , believe , belong to and do is increasingly interwoven with countless information systems; and many of these are more adept at delivering persuasion and plausibility than truth. None of this is to deny the power and potentials of technologies like AIs, or the countless ways in which they may enhance humanity's scope and self-knowledge. But it is to make the case that, as Dennett put it, AIs are likely to ""evolve to get themselves reproduced. And the ones that reproduce the best will be the ones that are the cleverest manipulators of us human interlocutors. The boring ones we will cast aside, and the ones that hold our attention we will spread. All this will happen without any intention at all. It will be natural selection of software."" Neither a human nor a machine-made masterplan is required for harmful scenarios to unfold. As Dennett's 2017 book From Bacteria to Bach argued, ""once the infrastructure for culture has been designed and installed [i.e. evolved in human minds]… the possibility of parasitical memes exploiting that infrastructure is more or less guaranteed."" In evolutionary terms, our minds aren't devices fine-tuned for differentiating truth from lies. We are partial, passionate, tribal creatures: social animals linked by bonds of love and loyalty that both define our humanity and make us painfully vulnerable. What is to be done? Thankfully, another defining feature of human thought is our capacity for reflecting upon precisely these limitations: for redressing, collectively and incrementally, the blind spots of personal perception. ""What you want,"" Dennett told me, ""is your thinking to be determined by the truth about what's out there. You want to be compelled by the good evidence there is out there for how the world is. But you also want to have the elbow room to reconsider, and reconsider, and reconsider further: your prospects, your projects, your goals. You want to be a higher order, intentional system that reflects upon means and ends and goals."" This is the scientific method in microcosm, with a flavour of humanist freethinking. The ""freedom"" to act on the basis of manipulatively inaccurate information is no freedom at all. By contrast, actions determined by ""the good evidence that is out there"" are emancipatory: open to the complexities of actuality rather than snared by untruths. To extend the thought experiment of ""Where Am I?"", imagine what would happen if your brain were placed in a vat and then – without your knowledge or permission – hooked up to a simulated version of reality. Within that virtual realm, you might still possess certain freedoms. In the context of the external world, however, you would be both trapped and deceived: cut off from every meaningful form of understanding and action. (Read more: The philosopher rethinking the definition of reality . ) Although it may seem purely a matter for speculative fiction, a version of this scenario plays out every time someone takes a false claim to be the literal truth – or an artificial entity to be a human. From conspiracy theories to totalitarian propaganda, from fabricated evidence to ersatz humans, reality-rejection is a booming business. And there's nothing inevitable about the endurance of tolerance, scepticism or reasoned debate in a world suffused with such things. Civilisation, Dennett told me, ""is more fragile than we realised"" – and all the more precious for this. Despite its conflicts, injustices and hatreds, we inhabit an era where it is possible for a large proportion of humanity to ""trust each other, have long-term projects, travel freely, raise families, live with very little fear. That's just wonderful. And we should preserve that. That social structure, really, at all costs."" This is the great danger of AI large language models and counterfeit people alike: ""that they will destroy the trust that we have engendered over thousands of years"". Despite all this – and his reputation for unyielding reasonableness – Dennett made it clear to me that he had no interest in transcending the limitations of human nature. Love and loyalty weren't, for him, biological baggage we would be better off moving beyond. Rather, they were motivating forces of the most profound kind: wellsprings of purpose and goodness, so long as they could be unshackled from egotism and hatred. ""Looking out for number one is a perfectly good agent rule. But number one can be understood very broadly. Number one can include your children, an idea, guitar playing, the Chicago Bears. Number one can be whatever you want it to be. That's what you care about the most. That's what you're going to protect. And this is obvious. If somebody wants to extort you, they don't have to threaten you. They just have to threaten what you love."" Biology is where it all begins and ends: the evolved, astonishing pattern of our emergence alongside every other form of life; the limitless complexities we are capable of conceiving via culture, language and computation; our common existence as creatures of flesh and blood. ""My children are both adopted,"" Dennett told me at the very end of our conversation. ""But I love them with the intensity of any biological dad. I can remember a moment in the early life of our eldest, when she was a little girl, maybe two years old or less, when I detected some possible threat on a playground or something, and it suddenly struck me, 'Oh, my goodness, I think I would kill to protect this child.' And it scared me, almost. But it also thrilled me, because it was a recognition of the intensity and depth of emotional attachment. And that's what life is all about."" *Tom Chatfield is a British author and philosopher of technology.

14,Grindr sued for allegedly revealing users' HIV status,"Grindr, the world's biggest dating app for the LGBT community, is being sued for allegedly sharing personal information such as people's HIV status with third parties. According to the claim, lodged at the High Court in London, ""covert tracking technology"" was deployed, and highly sensitive information was illegally shared with advertisers. Law firm Austen Hays says there are more than 650 claimants and ""thousands"" of UK users were affected. Grindr says it will ""respond vigorously"" to the claim. A Grindr spokesperson said the company takes privacy ""extremely seriously"", and added the claim ""appears to be based on a mischaracterization of practices from more than four years ago"". Austen Hays says, if the case is successful, claimants could receive thousands of pounds in damages. The claim form submitted to the High Court says the law firm hopes to claim more than £100,000 in total. Chaya Hanoomanjee from Austen Hays, who is the lawyer leading the claim, said the claimants ""experienced significant distress over their highly sensitive and private information being shared without their consent"". “Grindr owes it to the LGBTQ+ community it serves to compensate those whose data has been compromised,"" she said. The dating app is used by 13 million people every month, and an Ofcom report from May 2023 found that it was used by roughly 924,000 people in the UK. It also had the highest engagement of all dating apps, with people using it for an average time of six hours and 49 minutes that month. According to the claim, the company shared sensitive data with third parties for commercial purposes, in breach of the UK's data privacy laws. It says it included information about the ethnicity and sexual orientation of users. The claim alleges it mainly occurred before 3 April 2018, though the data was also  shared between 25 May 2018 and 7 April 2020. It names data analytics companies Apptimize and Localytics as third parties which had access to the sensitive data. However, it says that a potentially unlimited number of third parties used the data to customise advertisements to Grindr's users. In addition, it is claimed that firms may then have retained some of the shared data for their own purposes. It emerged in 2018 that Grindr had been sharing personal data, including HIV status of users, with Apptimize and Localytics. Those companies were paid to monitor how people used the app in order to improve it. At the time, Grindr defended the practice, saying it was in line with industry standards – but it said it then stopped sharing HIV data with those companies. The firm said it had never sold the data to any advertisers. In 2021, the company was fined £5.5m by Norwegian authorities for breaking GDPR (EU general data protection regulation) rules. It was found to have shared user data, without seeking explicit consent, to third-party companies for the purpose of advertising. In 2022, Grindr was reprimanded by the UK's data watchdog over its data protection practices. The Information Commissioner's Office ruled that the company had failed to ""provide effective and transparent privacy information to its UK data subjects in relation to the processing of their personal data"". The BBC has contacted Apptimize and Localytics for comment.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj7mxnvz42no,tech
15,From WhatsApp to Greggs - why is tech going down more?,"What links Greggs, maker of the UK’s most popular sausage roll, and tech titans Apple and Meta? In March and April 2024, all have seen customers struggle to access some of their services - from baked goods , to Big Macs and WhatsApp messages – because of IT outages. Coincidence? Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are happening more frequently. These recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the spotlight. Downdetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea of the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently. More than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for WhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site. It says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV. Neither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their outages. But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen. ""The internet is not exactly getting more stable,"" he told the BBC. To understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet itself. Like software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. Introducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going wrong. ""Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-changing new technology into their products and services,"" Mr Smith said. ""I think with the push for innovation now, we're going to start to see tech companies move faster [but] it comes at the risk of potentially breaking things."" The other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down. Even severe weather, such as heatwaves , storms and natural disasters can affect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as servers, upon which online services rely. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and if just one of those goes wrong you can see problems,"" says Sam Kirkman of cyber-security firm NetSPI. Another issue is lots of firms have moved from managing their servers and infrastructure in-house to putting them on the cloud over the last decade. That has enabled those firms to do more ""faster than they ever could before"", Mr Kirkman told the BBC - but it also means a single outage in one place at the cloud service provider can ""cascade across a lot of the platforms, technologies and companies we use today"". Glitches for some of the biggest names in the industry - namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - have previously led to downtime for thousands of customers. Even those impacting smaller, yet heavily relied-upon providers like Fastly and Cloudflare have also had a knock-on effect for services. The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021 . 'It had just vanished' - the shock when tech fails Sudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages, especially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed periods like bank holidays or weekends. Theories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be speculation, Mr Smith says. But he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on them. ""Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a time where you don't want to be rolling out changes,"" he says. IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes. More widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online during outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users trying to get hold of it. Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called ""thundering herds"" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site. Underpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world: while the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its basic architecture is, often, quite antiquated. In other words, the modern internet relies ""on a fabric of really old technology"", says Mr Kirkman. He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021 . Misconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to the rest of the internet. And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses . Mr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be maintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take down entire platforms. It highlights what he says some might consider ""technical debt"" as an issue potentially affecting the whole of the internet. These problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services means they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent them. ""What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,"" says Mr Smith. ""I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to stay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to market,"" he adds.",2024-04-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxrz350qyy5o,tech
16,Ofcom: Almost a quarter of kids aged 5-7 have smartphones,"Nearly a quarter of UK five-to-seven-year-olds now have their own smartphone, Ofcom research suggests. Social media use also rose in the age group over last year with nearly two in five using messaging service WhatsApp, despite its minimum age of 13. The communications regulator warned parental enforcement of rules ""appeared to be diminishing."" It also said the figures should be a ""wake up call"" for the industry to do more to protect children. In its annual study of children's relationship with the media and online worlds, Ofcom said the percentage of children aged between five and seven who used messaging services had risen from 59% to 65%. The number on social media went up from 30% to 38%, while for livestreams it increased from 39% to 50%. Just over 40% are reported to be gaming online - up from 34% the year before. Over half of children under 13 used social media, contrary to most of the big platforms' rules, and many admitted to lying to gain access to new apps and services. ""I think this is a wake up call for industry. They have to take account of the users they have, not the users that their terms and conditions say they have,"" Mark Bunting, from Ofcom's Online Safety Group told BBC News. ""We've known for a long time that children, under the age limit on a lot of the most popular apps, are widely using those apps, and companies are now under a legal obligation to take steps to keep those children safe,"" he added. Some campaigners want age limits to be introduced for smartphone use, and existing ones raised for social media. However it is already the case that most phones possessed by children are likely to have been provided by parents - under-18's cannot sign contracts, and most big operators say they do not sell pay-as-you-go phones to under-16's. Many parents give children phones because they want to be able to contact them or to track them via their mobile. How can you keep children safe online? Parents who spoke to the BBC also cited peer pressure, saying it was a struggle to keep children off social media when all their friends were a using an app. One parent said she felt ""pushed into a corner"". Heather Bryson who is 11 won wide recognition for her online exercise videos designed to help people in care homes during the pandemic, particularly those suffering dementia. She's had a smartphone since she was eight-years-old. Her parents feel she's benefited socially from being online, but what she does and who she communicates with are closely supervised. ""I think it's become an important tool for anyone growing up these days"", her father, Gary Bryson says. ""Being able to monitor exactly what she's doing is paramount"". Heather says it lets her talk with friends on social media and through message apps, but there are negatives. ""Sometimes I get boys swearing at me online in chats which is not nice, but the good things there are loads of nice people out there too"". ""It's just something that you get used to after a while but you shouldn't have to"", she says. Only a third of parents know the correct minimum age requirement for most social media platforms Ofcom suggests But the regulator said parents were also less willing to enforce the rules they knew about. Three in ten parents were willing to let a child aged 5-7 have a social media profile even if it was under the minimum age permitted for the apps, an increase compared to last year. Parents may be ""resigned"" to not being able to control children's online lives the new report notes. Mr Bunting said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for parents on this issue: ""It may not be about preventing use entirely for children under 13, which I think is very difficult in today's society. But parents can talk to their children about using those services safely. And we'd encourage them to do that,"" he said. Some say investigations like that carried out by the BBC this month - which found that children as young as nine were added to a malicious WhatsApp group - mean further action is needed. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has previously suggested that he favours requiring app-stores to check the ages of users. Responding to the Ofcom report, Clare Fernyhough, of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, told the BBC that society had sleep-walked into ""just assuming that we all need a smartphone - and now we're beginning to see the huge impact that that's having"" But Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre, said it was wrong to protect children by restricting their access to technology. ""This is the first generation with access to a powerful personal computer, it could be so amazing for them, and that's what children want too,"" she told the BBC. ""But the companies are risky by design, and what we need is child rights by design"", she said. Ofcom said new age limits for smartphones would be a matter for government. In May it will be consulting on the steps it expects tech firms to take to ensure children have safer experiences online, and later on new uses of AI to combat harmful content online. In a statement, the Secretary of State for Science, Technology and Innovation Michelle Donelan said protecting children online was the government's number one priority. ""Children as young as five should not be accessing social media and these stark findings show why our Online Safety Act is essential,"" she said. Does your young child have a smartphone?

17,Why Elon Musk's Neuralink brain implant reframes our ideas of self-identity,"When we merge mind and machine, the traditional borders of the self dissipate, says philosopher Dvija Mehta. In March, a man called Noland Arbaugh demonstrated that he could play chess using only his mind . After living with paralysis for eight years, he had gained the ability to perform tasks previously inaccessible to him, thanks to a brain implant designed by Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk. ""It just became intuitive for me to imagine the cursor moving,"" Arbaugh said in a live stream . ""I just stare somewhere on the screen, and it would move where I wanted it to."" Arbaugh's description alludes to a sense of his own agency: he was suggesting he was responsible for moving the chess piece. However, was it him or the implant that performed the actions? As a philosopher of mind and AI ethicist, I am fascinated by this question. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies like Neuralink symbolise a new era in the intertwining of the human brain and machines, asking us to reconsider our intuitions about identity, the self and personal responsibility. In the near-term, the technology promises many benefits for people like Arbaugh, but the applications could go further. The company's long-term vision is to make such implants available to the general population to augment and enhance their abilities too. If a machine can perform acts once reserved for the cerebral matter inside our skulls, should it be considered an extension of the human mind, or something separate? For decades, philosophers have debated the borders of personhood: where does our mind end, and the external world begin? On a simple level, you might assume that our minds rest within our brains and bodies. However, some philosophers have proposed that it's more complicated than that. In 1998, the philosophers David Chalmers and Andy Clarke presented the ""extended mind"" hypothesis , suggesting that technology could become part of us. In philosophical language, the pair proposed an active externalism , a view in which humans can delegate facets of their thought processes to external artefacts, thereby integrating these artefacts into the human mind itself. This was before the smartphone, but it predicted the way that we now offload cognitive tasks to our devices, from wayfinding to memory. As a thought experiment, Chalmers and Clarke also imagined a scenario ""in the cyberpunk future"" where somebody with a brain implant manipulated objects on a screen – much like Arbaugh has just done. To play chess, Arbaugh imagines what he wants, like moving a pawn or bishop. And his implant, in this case Neuralink's N1, picks up neural patterns of his intent, before decoding, processing, and executing actions. So, what should we make of this philosophically now that it's actually happened? Is Arbaugh's implant part of his mind, entwined with his intentions? If it's not, then it poses thorny questions about whether he has true ownership of his actions. To understand why, let's consider a conceptual distinction: happenings and doings . Happenings encapsulate the entirety of our mental processes, such as our thoughts, beliefs, desires, imaginations, contemplations, and intentions. Doings are happenings that are acted upon, such as the finger movements you're using to scroll down this article right now. Usually, the gap between happenings and doings does not exist. For instance, let's take the case of a hypothetical woman, Nora – not a BCI-integrated person – playing chess. She can form an intention through regulating her happenings to move the pawn to d3, and simply does so by moving her hand. In Nora's case, the intention and the doing are inseparable; she can attribute the action of moving the pawn to herself. For Arbaugh, however, he must imagine his intent, and it's the implant that performs the action in the external world. Here, happenings and doings are separate. More like this: This raises some serious concerns, such as whether a person using a brain implant to augment their abilities can gain executive control over their BCI-integrated actions. While human brains and bodies already produce plenty of involuntary actions, from sneezes to clumsiness to pupil dilation, could implant-controlled actions feel alien? Might the implant seem like a parasitic intruder gnawing away at the sanctity of a person's volition? I call this problem the contemplation conundrum . In Arbaugh's case, he skips crucial stages of the causal chain, such as the movement of his hand that instantiates his chess move. What happens if Arbaugh first thinks of moving his pawn to d3 but, within a fraction of a second, changes his mind and realises he would rather move it to d4? Or what if he is running through possibilities in his imagination, and the implant mistakenly interprets one as an intention? The stakes are low on a chess board, but if these implants became more common, the question of personal responsibility becomes more fraught. What if, for example, bodily harm to another person was caused by an implant-controlled action? And this is not the only ethical problem these technologies raise. Perfunctory commercialisation without fully resolving the contemplation conundrum and other issues could pave the way to a dystopia reminiscent of science-fiction tales. William Gibson's novel Neuromancer, for example, highlighted how implants could lead to loss of identity, manipulation, and an erosion of privacy of thought. The crucial question in the contemplation conundrum is when does a ""happening of imagination"" turn to ""intentional imagination to act""? When I apply my imagination to contemplate what words to use in this sentence, this is itself an intentional process. The imagination directed towards action – typing the words – is also intentional. In terms of neuroscience, differentiating between imagination and intention is nearly impossible. A study conducted in 2012 by one group of neuroscientists concluded that there are no neural events that qualify as ""intentions to act"". Without the capability to recognise neural patterns that mark this transition in someone like Arbaugh, it could be unclear which imagined scenario is the cause for effect in the physical world. This allows partial responsibility and ownership of action to fall on the implant, and questioning again whether the actions are truly his , and whether they are a part of his personhood? However, now that Chalmers and Clarke's extended mind thought experiment has manifested into reality, I propose revisiting their foundational ideas as one method to bridge the divide between happenings and doings in people with brain implants. The adoption of the extended mind hypothesis would allow someone like Arbaugh to hold responsibility over their actions rather than divide it with the implant. This cognitive view suggests that to experience something as one's own, one must think about it as one's own . In other words, they must think of the implant as a part of their self-identity and within the borders of their inner life. If so, a sense of agency, ownership, and responsibility can follow. Brain implants like Arbaugh's have undoubtedly opened a new door for philosophical discussions about the border between mind and machine. The debate over action and agency has traditionally circled around the skin and skull boundary of identity. However, with brain implants, this boundary has become malleable – and that means the self may extend further into technology than ever before. Or as Chalmers and Clarke observed: ""Once the hegemony of skin and skull is usurped, we may be able to see ourselves more truly as creatures of the world."" * Dvija Mehta is an AI ethics researcher and philosopher of mind at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, University of Cambridge. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

18,Apple 'beta' update addresses Jerusalem emoji controversy,"Apple has released a partial update to its iPhone software which stops the Palestinian flag emoji being suggested when users type the word ""Jerusalem"". The issue had sparked controversy , with critics noting the names of other cities do not prompt flag emojis to appear. Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city. Apple previously told the BBC the flag's appearance when Jerusalem was typed had been inadvertent. The issue, according to Apple, related to unintended behaviour in a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps. Users noticed the flag started being suggested after the company rolled out iOS 17.4.1 - the latest publicly available version of the software on which its mobile devices run. Critics such as TV presenter Rachel Riley had demanded Apple explain why the flag appeared, particularly when other cities do not produce flag emojis when typed. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism,"" she wrote on social media . Apple's apparent resolution is currently only in the ""developer beta"" version of iOS 17.5 released on Tuesday. The Apple Developer Programme allows programmers building apps to sign up for early releases of the software - called beta versions - so they can test out apps they are building on them. In the new update no emoji is suggested when a user types ""Jerusalem"", in line with what happens with other cities. It's not clear when the update will be released more widely, either as a public beta, or as an finished update to the general public. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967. They have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. There have been increased tensions in the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed 33,729 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68831685,tech
19,My battle with Tesla: I want to clear my name before I die,"A Tesla whistleblower who has battled Elon Musk and his company through the courts for a decade tells BBC News she is still seeking a public apology. Engineer Cristina Balan was once such a rising star at Tesla in the US that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside every Model S electric car. But after raising a safety concern about a design flaw which could affect the cars’ braking in 2014, she claims management turned hostile, and she lost her job. She won a wrongful dismissal case but was later publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a “secret project” – accusations which amount to embezzlement which is a crime under US law. Ms Balan has consistently denied the accusation, and has taken legal action but years later, she is still waiting to have her case heard fully in an open court in California. Tesla did not respond to BBC News’ requests for comment. The firm has never provided any further details about its accusation. Ms Balan says she is determined to prove her innocence for the sake of her son: “I’m his hero,"" she says. ""I’m the mommy who does airplanes and cars.” And she does not want him to grow up believing his mother was a thief. Towards the end of our Zoom call, Cristina Balan removed her wig and tearfully told me she had just finished breast-cancer treatment. ""I want to clear my name. I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise,"" is her message to the company’s billionaire boss. And she says that while she is currently in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, her biggest worry is she may not live to see her final day in court. Ms Balan shared with BBC News various communications between herself and Tesla from her time working there. She got off to a good start: she recalls chatting to Mr Musk in the lunch queue at the staff canteen and says she was happy and successful – living her dream, after growing up in Romania with a lifelong passion for cars. ""Everything went south when I realised that they were hiding some critical safety issues,"" she claims. Ms Balan was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals – a simple but potentially lethal design flaw - and said customers had complained. ""If you cannot push the brake, someone else, outside of a Tesla, can get injured,"" she says. ""They just had to say, ‘We realise the carpets are bad - just take them out of the cars.’"" But managers rebuffed her concerns and became hostile, Ms Balan claims. So she emailed Mr Musk, who had directly encouraged employees to come to him personally with any worries that could affect Tesla’s reputation. ""I emailed him two emails,"" Ms Balan says. ""I sent him one before I was out [of Tesla], telling him that we are all threatened. ""I was thinking in my head, 'He still wants to do what’s right for Tesla.'"" But it failed – and Ms Balan went on to lose her job. BBC News put her claims to Tesla but received no response. The company's website says: ""Safety is the most important part of every Tesla. ""We design our vehicles to exceed safety standards"". Another Tesla whistleblower, Lukasz Krupski , claimed to have had a similar, unrelated experience after emailing Mr Musk over concerns about working conditions at Tesla’s Norway headquarters. And Ms Balan says other Tesla staff may be “afraid to speak up”. Her case will eventually be heard in the California Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. It is her only chance of professional vindication, Ms Balan believes. ""I don’t want to give up my career,"" she says. ""And I know that if I’m not winning this, it doesn’t matter how good I am. “Everybody will look at what Tesla say about [me], so my career is gone. ""I do not want that.” Mr Musk's leadership style is notoriously unconventional - but some of those to have worked for him say he gets results. Dolly Singh, who worked at SpaceX for Mr Musk between 2008 and 2013,  previously told BBC News he was an ""incredible leader"". ""If that wasn't the case, he wouldn't be accomplishing the things that he is,"" she said, in 2022. ""Yes, it's exhausting to work for Elon. ""But I think it's a proving ground like nothing else."" US lawyer Gordon Schnell, from the firm Constantine Cannon, says a rising number of technology-sector workers are becoming whistleblowers. The stakes are so high because tech products have ""such a wide impact on the world,"" he says. ""It really touches all of our lives,"" he says. But the advice of Mr Schnell, who specialises in representing whistleblowers, is to explore every possible option before going public with any claims. ""There are so many protected channels in so many different industries that a whistleblower can take, where they can get confidential concerns to the proper government agencies that are best suited to address those concerns,"" he says.

20,Tesla lays off more than 10% of its workforce,"Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global electric vehicle workforce. In a memo, first reported by news website Electrek, billionaire owner Elon Musk told staff there was nothing he hated more, ""but it must be done"". The world's largest vehicle-maker by market value had 140,473 employees globally as of December, according to its latest annual report. Tesla has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. ""We have done a thorough review of the organisation and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally,"" said the email from Mr Musk. ""There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle."" A Tesla employee who had been told he was being let go told the BBC he had subsequently been locked out of his emails, as had all other staff being laid off. One of the executive team, Andrew ""Drew"" Baglino, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday he had made the ""difficult decision"" to leave the firm after 18 years. Mr Baglino had served as senior vice president of Tesla's powertrain and energy engineering team since 2019, according to Tesla's website . Another executive heading up public policy and business development, Rohan Patel, is set to leave too. He personally thanked Mr Musk for giving him the chance and ""empowering"" him to lead big initiatives at the firm. He also said that the ""never-say-die attitude and scrappiness"" of the wider Tesla team is what he thought made it a special place to work. Their departures ""signal that Tesla's major growth phase is meeting serious headwinds,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, deeming it ""the larger negative signal today"" than the announcement of job cuts. However, analysts from Gartner and Hargreaves Lansdown said the cuts were a sign of cost pressures as the carmaker invested in new models and artificial intelligence. The electric vehicle (EV) maker has been slow to refresh its aging models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items. There is also the ongoing pressure from China as the rise of their inexpensive EVs have begun to flood the market with affordable models . The company is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month but has already reported a decline in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, its first in nearly four years and also below market expectations. Some analysts described the results as ""tumultuous."" Last month, Tesla reduced production at the Gigafactory in Shanghai and last week Tesla told employees who work on the Cybertruck that shifts will be shorter on the production line at the Austin. Tesla has begun to feel the impact of slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). Elon Musk has recently denied reports that the company has scrapped plans to produce an inexpensive car, which has been one of his longstanding goals to make affordable EVs for the masses. Tesla shares were down 0.8% in premarket trading on Monday.",2024-04-16,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68818113,tech
21,UK competition watchdog has 'real concerns' over big tech AI dominance,"Big tech's dominance of the rapidly developing artificial intelligence (AI) market is a matter of ""real concern"", the competition regulator has warned. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking into the new breed of powerful AI tools - foundation models. They include text and image generators, such as ChatGPT. The CMA found an ""interconnected web"" of AI partnerships involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and chip-maker Nvidia. ""When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,"" Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA said. ""The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences."" Ms Cardell delivered the warning in a speech on Thursday in Washington. The CMA said that a small number of incumbent technology firms - already powerful in the most important digital markets - were also now taking the lead with foundation models. Trained on vast amounts of data, they underpin tools which are transforming workplaces and other aspects of modern life. The big tech firms have strong positions in terms of computing power, and access skilled employees, the CMA said, and can influence access to the market through apps and platforms. This could profoundly impact fair competition ""ultimately harming businesses and consumers, for example through reduced choice, lower quality, and higher prices, as well as stunting the flow of potentially unprecedented innovation and wider economic benefits from AI"", the CMA argued. The CMA said it wanted to learn from previous experience in digital markets where ""winner takes all dynamics"" led to the rise of a small number of powerful platforms. It said it was ""determined to apply the lessons of history"" at what it termed a ""pivotal moment in the emergence of a new, potentially transformative technology."" In a new paper , it found more than 90 connected investments and partnerships involving the same small number of tech giants. The watchdog is already undertaking a review of Microsoft's multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI. But it said it recognised ""the huge wealth of resources, expertise and innovation capability these large firms can bring to bear"". However, these should not ""insulate"" powerful firms from competition.",2024-04-11,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68789880,tech
22,Instagram to test new tools to fight so-called sextortion,"Instagram will start testing new tools within weeks to fight ""sextortion"", a form of blackmail involving intimate pictures sent online. The tools include ""nudity protection"", which blurs naked images in direct messages. It will be turned on by default for under-18s. Pop-ups directing potential victims to support will also be trialled. Governments around the world have warned of the increasing threat to young people from sextortion. It often involves victims being sent a nude picture, before being invited to send their own in return - only to then be threatened that the image will be shared publicly unless they give in to the blackmailer's demands, On Wednesday, two Nigerian men pleaded guilty to sexually extorting teenage boys and young men in the US, including one who took his own life. The offence has also recently been linked to the suicide of a teenager in Australia. There are also harrowing cases of paedophiles using sextortion to coerce and abuse children. Much of the sextortion Instagram sees on its platform is the work of sophisticated criminal gangs seeking money. It is a ""horrific"" crime, the platform says. Its nudity protection system, first revealed in January , uses artificial intelligence (AI) running entirely on the user's device to detect nude images in direct messages and give users a choice whether to view them. It is designed ""not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude images to trick people into sending their own images in return,"" Instagram said. But Instagram stresses the system, which is opt-in for adults, does not report nude images to the company automatically, though users will be reminded they can block and report accounts if they wish. When the system detects naked images being sent, the user will be directed to safety tips, including reminders that recipients may screenshot or forward images without the sender's knowledge. The platform now says it will also deploy measures that detect signs that a user may potentially be a sextortionist and make it harder for them to interact with others including: For people who may have interacted with an account removed for sextortion, Instagram is testing pop-up messages that will direct them to expert advice and support. Instagram also says it will share more data to fight sextortion and child abuse with other tech firms through an initiative called Lantern . The announcement comes on the same day WhatsApp, another Meta platform, reduces its minimum age in the UK and Europe from 16 to 13. According to the platform, the minimum age is already 13 in the majority of countries around the world But Smartphone Free Childhood, a campaign group which believes smartphones expose children to harmful content, called the decision to reduce the minimum age ""tone deaf"". WhatsApp argues users, including teenagers, have extensive of controls over who they interact with.",2024-04-11,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68778834,tech
23,Why it could be harder to find love nowadays,"Finding a long-term partner is trickier than ever, argues Paul C Brunson, author of the book Find Love. David Robson asks him how cultural and technological shifts are changing our relationships. Technology offers us many new opportunities for meeting romantic or sexual partners, but has this altered our overall attitudes to dating and relationships? To find out, science writer David Robson spoke to Paul C Brunson, a global relationships insight expert for Tinder and author of the new book Find Love: How to Navigate Modern Love and Discover the Right Partner for You . Is it true that finding a partner is harder now than ever before? Finding a partner has always been a very important decision, but based on the research for this book, I do believe that finding and keeping love today is harder than any point in human history. One reason is that today, we have more variations of what is considered an acceptable relationship. You can be monogamous or in a polyamorous relationship, living together or living apart – there are dozens and dozens of acceptable forms. And that makes finding the partner to match your end goal more challenging. Secondly, we demand more from our partner than ever before. Formerly, it was the person to help protect or raise the child, or to tend the farm. Then, as you move through the ages, it became someone who would be a companion. But now – as [psychologist] Eli Finkel discusses in his research – we've reached a point of ""self-evolution"", where we are searching for everything out of our partner. We want them to be our intellectual equal, we want them to be the CEO of the business that we launch, we want them to be a great co-parent, we want them to be a phenomenal sex partner. How about technology? Some people seem to feel overwhelmed by the opportunities of meeting new people. We fool ourselves into the paradox of choice. We believe that we have endless options. But in actuality, if you downloaded 100 dating apps, how many actual dates could you get that week? It's limited, so we don't have as many choices as we believe. In your book, you describe another apparent paradox : the fact that on average, people are less happy with their relationships, but the top 20% – those who are the most happy with their partners – are even more content than they had been. How do you explain that? Many marriages now have low satisfaction, and there's a variety of reasons. For example, we are aware that there's more choice and believe the grass is greener, and we also have more knowledge. You can take an assessment of attachment style online, for example, and figure out whether or not you or your partner are paired in a strong way. That could create doubts about the relationship? Right, a lot of people are disgruntled. But some people are using these tools to their advantage. They are trying to figure out the void in their relationship, so they can make it better. They are inspiring each other to work on their wellbeing. This means there is a smaller percentage of people with high satisfaction, and a large percentage with, unfortunately, lower satisfaction. You mentioned attachment styles. How do they reflect our childhood experiences with our caregivers, and how do they influence our adult relationships? You have secure attachment, which is essentially someone who, when their caregiver was absent, felt secure and were able to self-soothe. They knew their caregiver would come back. Then you have the anxious attachment style: if the caregiver left the room and came back, they would have a hard time restabilising, because they're anxious that the caregiver could leave again. There's the avoidant attachment style: if the caregiver left the room and came back, the child doesn't care, because they believe that the caregiver doesn't really care about them, and so they can only rely on themselves. The fourth category is ""disorganised"", which is a combination of avoidant and anxious. The way that we attached as children is often how we attach as adults to our loved ones. So you can see someone who has an anxious style is always concerned that their partner is going to leave. Someone who has an avoidant style is not going to be emotionally open to their partner. A secure style is essentially going to be healthier. Attachment styles have become very popular, but it's important to be aware of the cultural differences and the cultural nuances. A child who is considered anxious in one area may be considered secure in another, because of how the child is raised differently. Given your work at Tinder, what kinds of errors are people making in their approaches to online dating? There are several mistakes. One is not doing the work ahead of time to identify the relationship goal. Because there are so many types of variations. We've now built a feature into Tinder that allows you to select your relationship goal. Because, if you're looking for a long-term partner, but I'm looking for a short-term partner, and we enter a relationship, it's going to be disastrous. Another big problem is that the photos are atrocious. People don't have recent photos, so when they show up on the date, they look nothing like the picture. It can seem like they are intentionally catfishing – but they're not. You know, when I joined Tinder two years ago, I had to open an account to see what it was all about, and I loaded a photo that was probably 12 years old. Now the person [I was working with] at Tinder said Paul, you don't look like that.  All of us think we look like we did 10 years ago, but we don't. You should have three to five photos – one that shows a genuine smile, one that shows your full body, and some photos of you doing something that you're passionate about. Last but not least, include some ""beige flags"" on your profile. These are the things that people may perceive as quirky, but you own it. One beige flag that I might [personally] give is that every month I play Dungeons and Dragons. A lot of people might make generalisations, and turn away. But then there would be another group that will be interested. And the fact that I have included my beige flag shows how much self-esteem I have, because I'm putting it out there. Are there any big generational differences in dating? We have to understand that Gen Z in your city or country may be different from the Gen Z population in another city or country, but there are generational differences. And one of the things I love is that they value authenticity. In our research at Tinder, we found that the number one determinant as to whether or not they wanted a second date was whether they felt comfortable being themselves with their partner, whereas in all previous generations, physical attraction was number one. Now, physical attraction was still number two [for Gen Z], but we're making strides. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect Brunson's relationship with Tinder.

24,Apple sparks Palestinian flag emoji controversy,"Apple has been criticised after the Palestinian flag emoji was automatically suggested to iPhone users who type ""Jerusalem."" Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city. TV presenter Rachel Riley, who is Jewish, noted on social media that national flags were not suggested for other capitals. Apple has told the BBC that the change - which followed a recent software update - was not intentional. The issue will be remedied in a future software update, Apple says, but it is not known how rapidly this will happen. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) , Ms Riley demanded that Apple explain what had happened. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism"", she argued. The issue, according to Apple, relates to a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps. The notes accompanying the latest iOS update say that it includes ""new emojis."" The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967, and have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. This is not the first time a big tech company has found itself embroiled in the bitter dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Last year rival tech giant Meta had to apologise after a bug resulted in it adding ""terrorist"" to the biographies of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian. Meta said it fixed a problem ""that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations"" in some of its products.",2024-04-10,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68778830,tech
25,TikTok to take on Instagram with photo app,"TikTok is to take on social media rival, Instagram, by launching a photo-sharing app. The company said it was working on a ""dedicated space"" for images and text. Some users have received notifications saying their photo posts will be shared to a new ""TikTok Notes"" app unless they opt out. It is the latest example of social media firms imitating each others' products - including Instagram launching Reels, a TikTok-like video tool, in 2020. “The copycat phenomenon runs rampant across social media platforms"", Mike Proulx, a research director at analysis firm Forrester, told the BBC. When done well copycat features ""pay off"", he added, giving the example of when Instagram copied Snapchat with its ""Stories"" feature. However, he pointed out a similar move by Twitter ended in failure, so there was no guarantee of success. Instagram's focus on making Reels more central to app has previously frustrated some users. Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were among those who shared a petition calling out changes to the platform that seemed to promote Reels over other features of the app in 2022. Instagram U-turned on the changes after the backlash. TikTok says it has not finalised the design of the Notes app, nor has it confirmed a release date. But notifications received by some users suggest the app will let users upload or share photo posts - which are currently a feature of the TikTok app and let people post a series of images with sounds and filters. Screenshots of the notification showed a toggle on the notifications allowing TikTok users to opt out of having their photo posts shared to the app. Social media consultant Matt Navarra said a text or photo app might be a space where the majority of TikTok users who “lurk”, rather than post, would engage more. But he said he did not think another photo-sharing app was something social media users were “desperate” for. “We have plenty of them, so I don’t think there’s that demand out there necessarily,” he said. It comes at a difficult time for the company, with the US passing legislation that could see TikTok banned unless its Chinese owner sells it within six months of passing its law. ""Launching Notes as a separate app would be a departure in strategy for TikTok, which has previously incorporated new features directly into the core app, but it makes sense given the current regulatory and consumer scrutiny,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""There are few places left where it doesn’t have a stronghold, and photo-sharing is one,"" she added. Mike Proulx suggested the best way forward for TikTok might be to copy what Meta did with its Twitter rival, Threads, where it leaned heavily on the existing Instagram user base. ""But like Threads, the key will be creating a compelling enough experience to get them to stick around TikTok Notes beyond the initial curiosity factor,"" he added. “When social media features all start to become ubiquitous, what differentiates one social media platform from another narrows. It comes down to community, user experience, and, yes, algorithms.”",2024-04-09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge8j2dyg1qo,tech
26,Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash,"Electric car giant Tesla has agreed to settle a lawsuit over a crash in 2018 which killed Apple engineer Walter Huang after his Model X, operating on Autopilot, collided with a highway barrier. The case, brought by Mr Huang's family, was scheduled to begin in the California Superior Court this week. If the trial had gone ahead, it would have brought increased scrutiny of the firm's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technology. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed and reports have said the deal still needs to be approved by a judge. Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Before the settlement, Tesla argued that Mr Huang had misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident. The firm has previously won trials in California by arguing that drivers involved had not followed its instructions to maintain attention while using the system. The electric vehicle (EV) maker faces a series of lawsuits over crashes related to the alleged use of its driver-assistant technology. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also been investigating some accidents involving Autopilot. For many years, Tesla has promised to produce an autonomous car but has yet to launch one. On Friday, Mr Musk said the company plans to unveil a self-driving robotaxi in August. The settlement with Mr Huang's family comes at a time when the company is battling weakening sales. Deliveries slid sharply in the first three months of this year as Tesla grappled with a fire at its European factory, global shipping disruption and growing competition. Tesla has cut prices repeatedly in response to increased competition from rivals such as BYD but demand in key markets like China has fallen. Tesla's shares have lost almost a third of their value since the start of this year.",2024-04-09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14kggkr4vro,tech
27,Why we have co-evolved with technology,"Our relationship with technology has a far deeper history than it seems, argues the philosopher and author Tom Chatfield in his book Wise Animals. The computer scientist Alan Kay once observed: ""Technology is anything that was invented after you were born, everything else is just stuff."" There's some truth to this: when asked to name a world-changing technology, many people might reach for something recent like AI, smartphones or the internet. What comes less readily to mind are the older ones, such as stone tools. However, if we want to understand today's technology better, we need to consider our long-running relationship with it, says philosopher and author Tom Chatfield. In his new book, Wise Animals: How Technology Made Us Who We Are , Chatfield argues we have co-evolved with technology over the last few million years. The entire human story, he says, is entwined with the innovations we create. Chatfield (who also contributes to BBC.com ) spoke to science writer David Robson about our ancestor's relationship with tech, how it has become an extension of our minds, and the insights that we can draw from taking a longer perspective on today’s developments. What inspired you to write Wise Animals? As someone who loves technology, I've been very frustrated by the way that it’s so often talked about – as though people are just consumers who are interested in buying technologies with a bunch of features that are going to fix their problems. Technology is implicated in everything we do; it's bound up with our politics, our personal relationships, the education of our children and the future of our planet. So it feels very important to me that we have a rich, multi-faceted way of talking and thinking about technology that gets the full spectrum of human activities into these discussions. As part of your research, you looked deep into prehistory and human evolution. What should we know about our ancestors' relationship with technology? The crucial point for me is that we can't put our finger on a single moment in which technology emerged, but we can say that technological culture predates the evolution of anything like Homo sapiens . When our ancient ancestors started crafting fine stone tools, and then later started creating survival strategies through fire and the harnessing of artificial heat, they moved to a place where technological expertise and bodies of knowledge were non-optional; when survival strategy was predicated upon intergenerational knowledge – an adaptation through nurture, rather than through nature. You suggest that technology is now so entwined with who we are that it's become an extension of our minds. What ethical issues does this bring? I borrow this concept from the philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers. They made the point that, in many ways, human minds are literally extended into aspects of the environment surrounding them. So when I write things down, or even when I use my fingers to count, I'm outsourcing an aspect of cognition. The same occurs when I use a computer to manipulate shapes on a screen to see whether they will or won't fit together or fit into a certain space. I am almost becoming a coupled system with that device in order to perform a cognitive act. Their paper predated the rise of the smartphone, and the thesis was so radical at the time that they had trouble finding a publisher, but it has now come to seem almost like common sense. If your phone batteries run out, you feel like a little bit of your mind is missing. A large part of your mental or cognitive capacities are bound up with the human-made world, and the ethics of these things and the values embedded in them are very important. For example, I could theoretically outsource a lot of child-raising to automated systems. I could set up surveillance cameras with climate control and AI. My children could be monitored in their rooms with facial recognition, and when they're sad, it could produce voices that cheer them up or it could them the story when they’re ready for bed. Fairly obviously, that is a horrific scenario, because, by outsourcing these things, I completely withdraw from a mutually caring, loving relationship with my children. The model for me is that we need a knowing and informed negotiation with the technologies around us – a conversation about what we want from the human-made world, why we want it, and which of its offerings might not be aligned with human thriving. These are incredibly important conversations. We mustn't be afraid to use the language of values and sentiment and morality when it comes to technology. As a prosaic personal example, I'm happy to offload navigational skills to my phone, but I hate it when my phone starts auto-suggesting answers to people's messages. I don't really want to offload my social cognition to a computer – I'd rather engage in real communication from my mind to another person's . Precisely. The question is, what tasks are so dangerous, dull, demeaning or repetitive that we're delighted to outsource them, and what do we feel are important to be done ourselves or by other humans? If I was going to be judged in a trial, I don't necessarily want an algorithm to pass a verdict on me, even if the algorithm is demonstrably very fair, because there's something about the human solidarity of people in society standing in judgement of other people. At work, I might prefer to have a relationship with human colleagues – to talk to and explain myself to other people – rather than just getting the work done more efficiently. Technology may have evolved with us, but it’s not alive. Yet many of the latest technologies, especially artificial intelligences, can appear to act like they have a mind, tricking us into recognising some kind of sentience. You describe this as the ""anthropomorphic delusion"". What is it? And why is it dangerous? There's a double danger to anthropomorphism. The first is that we treat machines like people, and project personalities, intentions and thoughts onto artificial intelligences. Although these systems are extraordinarily sophisticated, they don't possess anything like the human sense. And it's very dangerous to act as though they do. For a start, they don't have a consistent worldview; they are miraculously brilliant forms of autocomplete, working on pattern recognition, working on prediction. This is very powerful, but they tend to hallucinate and make up details that don't exist, and they will often contain various forms of bias or exclusion based upon a particular training set. But an AI can respond fast and plausibly to anything, and as human beings, we are very predisposed to equate speed and plausibility with truth. And that's a very dangerous thing. You may also like: Similarly, we might overlook the very large corporations that lie behind these entities, who have their own agendas, their own modes of profit, their own issues around privacy, and so on. So anthropomorphism gets in the way of something really important, which is the well-informed, critically engaged process of debating what these systems are, what they can do for us, what their risks are, and how we should deploy and regulate them The other danger of anthropomorphising technology is that it can lead us to think of and treat ourselves like we're machines. But we are nothing like large language models: we are emotional creatures with minds and bodies who are deeply influenced by our physical environment, by our bodily health and well-being. Perhaps most importantly, we shouldn’t see [a machine’s] efficiency as a model for human thriving. We don't want to optimise ourselves with perfectible components, within some vast consequentialist system. The idea that humans can have dignity and autonomy and potential is very ill-served by the desire to optimise, maximise and perfect ourselves.

28,X gives free blue ticks to its most popular users,"X, formerly Twitter, is giving blue ticks to its most ""influential"" users in a significant change of policy. Those with more than 2,500 verified followers - people already paying for X Premium - have been given premium features for free. As well as the blue tick, the users will see fewer adverts on X. The social media platform also announced it was clearing bots so people may notice follower numbers decreasing. Blue ticks were originally a way to verify users were who they claimed to be, but they became a paid-for feature after Elon Musk purchased the site. However, according to messages received by people who have been given the features, it is now being given out without cost if a person is an ""influential member of the community"". Premium users also see their tweets ranked higher when replying to others, and it enables them to apply for revenue sharing from adverts on the site. Meanwhile, people with more than 5,000 verified followers have been given free access to Premium+, which removes almost all adverts and ranks their tweets even higher when replying to another person. It comes after Mr Musk announced the feature in late March. Before X was bought by Mr Musk, the blue tick was a badge of verification given for free by the platform. It was originally used as a tool of authentication, designed to help stop fake accounts and the spread of misinformation. The blue tick was once seen as a marker of a person's authoritativeness on the site, as only a few people could become verified, such as celebrities, government workers and journalists. Mr Musk disliked this system, which he criticised as creating a split between ""lords and peasants"". Under the billionaire, the blue tick instead became a symbol showing that an account had subscribed to X Premium - previously called Twitter Blue - with a verification process attached to that payment. But now it has become a combination of the two - with a person simply seen as prominent if they are followed by enough people with a checkmark of their own.",2024-04-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68718291,tech
29,Google using AI to come up with search answers in UK trial,"Google has begun trialling search answers written by artificial intelligence (AI) in the UK, after the feature was tested in the US last year. Initially only a small proportion of logged-in UK users will see an AI-generated ""overview"" at the top of some search results. While Google is the most popular search engine, Microsoft's rival Bing already integrates its Copilot AI. But some publishers worry AI answers may reduce visits to their sites. They fear longer chatbot-style responses will satisfy users' curiosity without having to visit their websites, while AI answers will also contain fewer links and ads. The ""Search Generative Experience"" - as Google dubs the feature - has been available for nearly a year in the US, but only to users who signed up via Google Labs. It said the UK experiment will involve a ""small slice"" of UK search traffic, selected from logged-in users. It comes as a front-page report in the Financial Times suggested that the firm was considering offering subscriptions for some premium AI search features in the future. Google denied it was ""working on or considering an ad-free search experience"". Hema Budaraju, who helps drive Google's generative AI efforts in search, told the BBC its new search results will still display links and ads. She said it was a ""priority"" to continue to send traffic to creators, and claimed AI-powered search results were ""actually showing more links to a wider range of sources"". The ""proof was in the pudding"", she said, adding that so far users were clicking on an increased range of sources too. The AI-generated ""overview"" will be shown only in response to certain queries, where current trials have suggested they were helpful. Ms Budaraju said a search for ""how to get marks off painted walls"" is one example that people have found useful. But Google is aware of the risk, common to AI systems, that they can sometimes generate content that is harmful, offensive, display racial or gender bias, or factually wrong. Ms Budaraju said the tech giant wanted to maintain ""information quality"", and it would ""put in a lot of care and attention to do this in a responsible way"". As a result, she said Google chose to make answers less fluent and more constrained, focusing instead on accuracy. For example, it is not generating AI answers to all queries, particularly where there aren't sufficient high quality sources of information. Users can send feedback if they encounter problems with the results - and Google is clear this is an experiment. ""We will find issues of bias and safety,"" she said, ""but the commitment is to find [these] and then invest in making it better"". The firm says US users have responded positively so far, but if the trial is successful and AI generated search answers are eventually used by billions of people, that may bring further challenges. For example, researchers have pointed to the large amounts of electricity required to power the computing that powers big AI systems. That is energy use that comes at an environmental price.",2024-04-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68730138,tech
30,Ukraine gives award to foreign vigilantes for hacks on Russia,"A team of vigilante hackers carrying out cyber-attacks against Russia has been sent awards of gratitude by Ukraine's military. The team, One Fist, has stolen data from Russian military firms and hacked cameras to spy on troops. The certificates are a controversial sign of how modern warfare is shifting. Concerns have been raised about the practice of states encouraging civilian hackers. One of the hackers called ""Voltage"" has been co-ordinating hacks from his home in the US. His real name is Kristopher Kortright and he is an IT worker from Michigan. The 53-year-old told the BBC he is delighted his efforts for Ukraine have been officially recognised with a certificate of gratitude. One Fist is made up of hackers from eight different countries including the UK, US and Poland. They have collectively launched dozens of cyber-attacks - celebrating each one on social media. The certificates were sent to them all for ""a significant contribution to the development and maintenance of vital activities of the military"". They were signed by the commander of the Airborne Assault Forces of Ukraine. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has controversially been encouraging volunteer hackers to attack Russian targets. But sending out official awards to foreign civilians is being seen as a controversial move and a sign of the times. Although many nations, including the UK and the US, have official award systems for ethical hacking, this is thought to be the first time a country has awarded hackers for malicious and possibly criminal hacks. In October, in response to the increase in vigilante hacking in Ukraine and in the Gaza conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned against the use and encouragement of civilian hackers. It published guidelines to reinforce the ethos of the rules of war laid out in the existing Geneva Conventions. Dr Lukasz Olejnik, author of Philosophy of Cyber-security, said Ukraine's awards to foreign hackers are potentially problematic. ""Giving out awards may further blur the lines between combatants and civilians, and even undermine the recent call by the ICRC to limit and end the involvement of civilians in combat operations. In the long run, such an erosion is dangerous,"" he said. Dr Olejnik also said it is a ""testament of our times"" that cyber is now considered as a domain of operations and that anyone can join the fight online. Kristopher started hacking Russia when it launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and says he has devoted himself to the cause and sacrificed a lot. ""I've lost my job doing this and spent all my life savings in pursuit of a victory for Ukraine,"" he said from his home office. ""This award is a real morale-booster,"" he said. The awards do not state which cyber-attacks were most useful, but Voltage has three in mind as the most likely candidates. At the start of the invasion in 2022, One Fist spent months mapping out the physical and cyber-locations of hundreds of publicly viewable CCTV cameras in Ukraine. It was discovered that Russian forces were using them to monitor troops, so his team helped get the cameras switched off. Conversely, it was One Fist that hacked into cameras in occupied Crimea to catalogue Russian tanks and equipment being moved over the Kerch bridge. And most recently, in January, Kristopher and others also successfully hacked into a prominent Russian weapons-maker and stole 100 gigabytes of private data, which led to a public celebration from the Ukrainian authorities. ""The array of information transferred to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine contains drawings, specifications, patents, software referring to both existing and promising military developments,"" the announcement said. Ukraine added that the data stolen was a ""significant blow"" to Moscow and worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) - although it did not say how this figure was reached The Ukraine conflict prompted a surge of cyber-activity - mostly from supporters of Ukraine. Groups like the Anonymous collective targeted Russia with disruptive and low-level hacks that Russia largely brushed off. In some instances, TV and radio stations were hijacked and news websites defaced. Russian authorities too have been accused of working with vigilante hacking groups like Killnet to attack Ukraine, but has never admitted having any relationship to the gangs. Most of the vigilante hacking activity on both sides dissipated after the first year as the war ground on. But One Fist has kept attacking Russia and increasingly worked closely with the Ukrainian forces on choosing targets. Emily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs and editor of Chatham House Cyber Policy journal, agrees that the hacking awards are a landmark moment that might shift thinking about how cyber volunteers are used in conflicts. ""Governments usually discourage non-state actors from taking direct action in the cyber-domain, for fear of escalation or unintended consequences, but wartime is often a period of extraordinary technological innovation, and the Ukraine invasion is no exception,"" she said. ""Sometimes these events force a reconsideration of issues that have previously been taboo."" Kristopher says his team has built up a strong relationship with the Ukrainian military. ""They send us ideas and we send them options but they don't ever give us any help or funding as I think that would cross some sort of line,"" he said. Kristopher recognises that receiving military awards is controversial, but is determined to keep hacking for Ukraine.",2024-04-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68722542,tech
31,Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj want stop to 'predatory' music AI,"Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj are among 200 artists calling for the ""predatory"" use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the music industry to be stopped. In an open letter also signed by Katy Perry and the estate of Frank Sinatra, they warn AI ""will set in motion a race to the bottom"" if left unchecked. Tech giants including YouTube have tested AI music-making tools . ""We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal artists' voices and likenesses,"" they said. They have called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"". In an open letter organised by campaign group the Artists' Rights Alliance and posted on long-form writing site Medium , the artists say AI will ""infringe upon our rights and devalue the rights of human artists"" if it is used irresponsibly. They said the way that artists' work is used to train some AI models and systems was ""an assault on human creativity"", and warned it was being used to ""violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem"". Tom Kiehl, interim head of industry association UK Music, said he shared the concerns of artists who worry their work is being used to train AI without their permission. ""This amounts to music laundering and any companies engaged in these practices must stop and take a more responsible approach to our music industry,"" he said. ""Ensuring artists have given their consent and receive appropriate credit and compensation for the use of their work on AI systems must be the foundation to a more responsible approach."" Artists spanning creative disciplines and genres have spoken out about how AI is used in recent months, after a song which used AI to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral online. Drake voiced disapproval over the song which sounded a lot like him - but was in fact generated using AI voice cloning tools - and appeared on Spotify and Apple Music before being abruptly pulled down . Other artists have since spoken out about it, with Sting telling the BBC he believes musicians face ""a battle"" to defend their work against the rise of songs written by AI. ""The building blocks of music belong to us, to human beings,"" he said. But not all musicians oppose developments in or use of AI across the music industry, and electronic artist Grimes and DJ David Guetta are among those backing the use of such AI tools. Grimes has even encouraged fans and budding musicians to use her voice ""without penalty"" and said she would split royalties on successful AI-generated tracks using her voice . The BBC has approached Google, which owns YouTube, for comment.",2024-04-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68717863,tech
32,AI Safety: UK and US sign landmark agreement,"The UK and US have signed a landmark deal to work together on testing advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The agreement signed on Monday says both countries will work together on developing ""robust"" methods for evaluating the safety of AI tools and the systems that underpin them. It is the first bilateral agreement of its kind. UK tech minister Michelle Donelan said it is ""the defining technology challenge of our generation"". ""We have always been clear that ensuring the safe development of AI is a shared global issue,"" she said. ""Only by working together can we address the technology's risks head on and harness its enormous potential to help us all live easier and healthier lives."" The secretary of state for science, innovation and technology added that the agreement builds upon commitments made at the AI Safety Summit held in Bletchley Park in November 2023. The event, attended by AI bosses including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and tech billionaire Elon Musk, saw both the UK and US create AI Safety Institutes which aim to evaluate open and closed-source AI systems. While things have felt quiet on the AI safety front since the summit, the AI sector itself has been extremely busy. Competition between the biggest AI chatbots - such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude - remains ferocious. So far the almost exclusively US-based firms behind all of this activity are still cooperating with the concept of regulation, but regulators have yet to curtail anything these companies are trying to achieve. Similarly, regulators have not demanded access to information the AI firms are unwilling to share, such as the data used to train their tools or the environmental cost of running them . The EU's AI Act is on its way to becoming law and once it takes effect it will require developers of certain AI systems to be upfront about their risks and share information about data used. This is important, after OpenAI recently said it would not release a voice cloning tool it developed due to ""serious risks"" the tech presents, particularly in an election year. In January, a fake, AI-generated robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden urged voters to skip a primary election in New Hampshire. Currently in the US and UK, AI firms are mostly regulating themselves. Currently, the majority of AI systems are only capable of performing single, intelligent tasks that would usually be completed by a human. Known as ""narrow"" AI, these tasks can range from quickly analysing data or providing a desired response to a prompt. But there are fears that more intelligent ""general"" AI tools - capable of completing a range of tasks usually performed by humans - could endanger humanity. ""AI, like chemical science, nuclear science, and biological science, can be weaponised and used for good or ill,"" Prof Sir Nigel Shadbolt told the BBC's Today programme. But the University of Oxford professor said fears around AI's existential risk ""are sometimes a bit overblown"". ""We've got to be really supportive and appreciative of efforts to get great AI powers thinking about and researching what the dangers are,"" he said. ""We need to understand just how susceptible these models are, and also how powerful they are."" Gina Raimondo, the US commerce secretary, said the agreement will give the governments a better understanding of AI systems, which will allow them to give better guidance. ""It will accelerate both of our Institutes' work across the full spectrum of risks, whether to our national security or to our broader society,"" she said. ""Our partnership makes clear that we aren't running away from these concerns - we're running at them.""",2024-04-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68675654,tech
33,Temu U-turns on terms of cash 'giveaway' offer,"Chinese e-retailer Temu has significantly changed the terms of a cash giveaway after customers expressed concerns. Participants in the promotion - which has gone viral on social media - receive up to £50, but had to agree to permanently hand over considerable amounts of personal data. Previously, Temu had said these were ""standard terms and conditions"". But now it says it has ""tweaked"" those terms because they were ""overly broad"". Data watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office, which had been looking into concerns about Temu's offer, said it would ""continue to consider the concerns raised"". The Chinese-owned online marketplace launched in the US in 2022 and the UK last year. It has been described as ""Amazon on steroids"" by retail experts and is known for selling goods at extremely cheap prices, using the slogan ""shop like a billionaire"". But it has faced criticism from politicians, with a US government investigation finding an ""extremely high risk"" that products on Temu could have been made with forced labour . The firm's giveaway gives new users 24 hours to sign up other people using a shareable link so each receive a cash reward of between £40 and £50 - paid to their PayPal accounts - or in Temu store credit. Existing Temu account holders can also participate, but appear to have to reach a higher threshold for such rewards. Thousands of users eager to cash in on the promotion have been seen posting links across social media sites. But it has also been the subject of memes and posts scrutinising the rules. The section receiving the most scrutiny states that ""except to the extent prohibited by applicable law"", participants give the company consent to use and publish their ""photo, name, likeness, voice, opinions, statements, biographical information, and/or hometown and state"" for advertising or promotional purposes. It adds this can take place in any media worldwide and ""in perpetuity"" - meaning with no fixed end date. One such post on X (formerly Twitter) with screengrabs of the campaign's usage and publicity rules has been viewed more than two million times, according to the platform's metrics. A number of other X users claimed the rules would allow Temu to sell their data or even create deepfake adverts - though those claims were strenuously denied by the retailer. But now, the fast growing, Chinese-owned retailer has changed those rules, saying ""some participants"" in the cash offer had ""expressed concern"". It said it had ""tweaked"" the terms and conditions ""to make it clear that we only ever use username and profile pictures in this promotion for referral functionality and winner announcements"". ""The previous terms and conditions were overly broad and inadvertently included promotional uses that Temu does not engage in,"" it added. ""Customer trust and satisfaction is at the heart of Temu, and we do not and will not sell customer data."" This is a U-turn compared with previous statements from the company. Previously, a Temu spokesperson had said giveaways were commonplace across many firms and different industries, and cited its e-commerce rival Shein as an example of a firm running promotions with ""nearly identical terms and conditions"". ""If these standard terms and conditions for run-of-the-mill promotional activities are newsworthy, then we urge you to be fair and report on their use by other companies instead of singling out Temu,"" the spokesperson had said. Experts had also raised concerns about the terms of the promotion. ""Giving away permission for Temu to use your 'voice' and 'biographical information' will understandably concern its customers,"" said Lisa Webb, Which? consumer law expert. ""These offers are going viral on social media, including to young people, but consumers should definitely consider whether they are comfortable giving this sensitive data away in return for cash."" She had added that ""while Temu isn't the first platform to excessively hoover up data, there are definite question marks over whether requesting permission for personal data to be used 'worldwide' is proportionate in any circumstances"". Jonathan Kirsop, data protection partner at law firm Pinsent Mason, had told BBC News it was not a wording he had seen used commonly before and the activity implied may have been ""problematic"". The previous terms could have fallen foul of UK data protection rules, which require user consent to be freely given, specific and able to be withdrawn in order for it to be relied upon as a reason for data processing. ""While not always prohibited, making the provision of services conditional on a consent to the use of personal data will often be unlawful on the basis the user may not be considered to have a free choice in delivering that consent, particularly where the data concerned is sensitive, such as biometric data,"" he said. The use of voice data - which is considered biometric data under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - has a higher threshold for lawful use and consent in the UK because it carries greater risks, he added. The data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, had previously said it was ""aware of reports about Temu"" and was ""considering the concerns raised."" In a fresh comment, made after Temu altered the terms and conditions, the data watchdog said: ""Organisations must be clear and transparent about how and why they collect and use people's personal information, and ensure people can make a fully informed decision as to whether to hand over their data."" ""We are aware of reports about Temu, and subsequent updates to the terms and conditions, and continue to consider the concerns raised."" Awais Rashid, professor of cyber security at the University of Bristol, had told BBC News that apps collecting a lot of data - often more than they actually need from users - had become commonplace. He said this, as well as cash incentives or long, sometimes ""indecipherable"" privacy policies and terms, can make the decision more difficult and imbalanced when deciding whether or not we as individuals should part with our data to use a service. ""Whenever there is such a deal being offered we must always look at: what is the consequence of this, and how much of our data is going to be collected, how it is going to be used, and are we comfortable with that?"" he said.

34,Sellafield to be prosecuted for IT security offences,"The company which runs the Sellafield nuclear site is being prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) says Sellafield Ltd is alleged to have committed the offences between 2019 and early 2023. The facility, on the Cumbrian coast, is widely regarded as Western Europe's most hazardous nuclear site. The ONR says public safety was not put at risk. The regulator says the decision to prosecute Sellafield follows an investigation it carried out. It says no further details can be given because legal proceedings are now under way. The Guardian reported in December 2023 that Sellafield had been hacked by cyber groups ""closely linked to Russia and China"". In an interview with the BBC later that month, Sellafield's boss, Euan Hutton, insisted there had been no cyber attack on the site. In response to ONR's announcement, Sellafield has issued a statement confirming it had been notified it was to be prosecuted. ""As the issue is now the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further,"" the statement added.",2024-03-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68675500,tech
35,Ninja: Twitch's biggest gamer shares cancer diagnosis,"US streamer Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins has revealed he has been diagnosed with melanoma, a form of skin cancer. Posting on X, the 32-year-old Fortnite gamer - who has 19m followers on Twitch - said a mole removed from his foot was found to be cancerous. Ninja said a second dark spot on his foot was also being checked, and though ""shocked"" he was ""grateful to have hope"" that the cancer was found early. He is urging others to get regular check-ups. Ninja has become synonymous with Twitch since his return to the streaming site in 2020, following a brief stint with Microsoft's rival platform Mixer - which was shutdown in June that year. Such is his popularity on Fortnite that players can pay to make their characters look like him. His status as one of the most recognisable names in streaming has also led to him appearing on mainstream programmes, such as The Masked Singer US. In his post on X , Ninja said he found out about the cancer after visiting a dermatologist for an annual check-up of his moles. ""There was a mole on the bottom of my foot that they wanted to remove just to be careful,"" he said. ""It came back as melanoma, but they are optimistic that we caught it in the early stages."" According to the NHS website , melanoma is a form of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, and is typically caused by ultraviolet light from the sun. It advises people to be careful in the sun, by using sunscreen and reapplying it regularly. Those more at risk of developing melanoma include people with pale skin, a large number of moles, and history of skin cancer in their family. Surgery is the main treatment, but in cases where the cancer has spread, chemotherapy might also be used.",2024-03-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68674388,tech
36,European flying car technology sold to China,"The tech behind a flying car, originally developed and successfully test-flown in Europe, has been bought by a Chinese firm. Powered by a BMW engine and normal fuel, the AirCar flew for 35 minutes between two Slovakian airports in 2021, using runways for take-off and landing. It took just over two minutes to transform from a car into an aircraft. Now vehicles made based on its design will be used within a ""specific geographical region"" of China. Hebei Jianxin Flying Car Technology Company, headquartered in Cangzhou, has purchased exclusive rights to manufacture and use AirCar aircraft inside an undisclosed area. The firm has built its own airport and flight school after a previous acquisition from another Slovak aircraft manufacturer, said Anton Zajac, cofounder of KleinVision, the company which created AirCar. Having led the way in the development of the EV revolution , China is now actively developing flying transport solutions. Last month a firm called Autoflight carried out a test flight of a passenger-carrying drone between the cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The journey, which takes three hours by car, was completed in 20 minutes, it said - although the aircraft contained no passengers. And in 2023 the Chinese firm eHang was awarded a safety certificate by Chinese officials for its electric flying taxi. Here, the UK government has said flying taxis could become a regular feature of the skies by 2028. But unlike these drone-like passenger aircrafts, AirCar does not take off and land vertically, and requires a runway. KleinVision declined to say how much it had sold the technology for. AirCar was issued with a certificate of airworthiness by the Slovak Transport Authority in 2022 and featured in a video published by YouTuber Mr Beast earlier this year. There are still considerable hurdles for this form of transport in terms of infrastructure, regulation and public acceptance of the technology. ""This brave new world of personal transport is acting as a great leveller,"" said aviation consultant Steve Wright. Global attempts to regulate the sector left ""everyone scrambling to come up with a whole new set of questions that need to be asked"". ""In this respect the West's history can sometimes slow things down, as there is a bit of a temptation to try and squeeze these new machines into the old categories,"" Mr Wright added. ""China could well see this as an opportunity to get ahead."" Similar concerns once applied to electric cars - in which China which has become a global market leader . The sale of the Slovakian AirCar could raise questions about whether China might be poised to do the same with flying cars. Mr Wright said while prototypes like the AirCar were ""great fun"", the reality was likely to end up being more mundane ""with queues and baggage checks and whatnot"".",2024-03-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68669296,tech
37,Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years',"The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing will drive a spike in energy use, the National Grid has predicted. Both rely on data centres - warehouses full of computer systems. Chief executive John Pettigrew said the power those data centres use would increase six-fold in the next decade. He said the grid was becoming ""constrained"" and ""bold action"" was needed to create a network able to cope with ""dramatically"" growing demand. ""Future growth in foundational technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing will mean larger scale, energy-intensive computing infrastructure,"" Mr Pettigrew said. The National Grid boss said in a speech on Tuesday, shared on LinkedIn , that now was ""a pivotal moment"" for grid transformation - with rising demand for energy-hungry technologies and more people opting for heat pumps or electric cars. ""Today, just like in the 1950s, we find ourselves with a network that's constrained,"" he said. ""Demand on the grid is growing dramatically, and forecast to double by 2050 as heat, transport and industry continue to electrify."" The high-voltage transmission network of cables and pylons that make up the UK's ""supergrid"" is now more than 70 years old. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in line with global targets, grid operators are under pressure to deliver upgrades to current infrastructure that can meet higher consumer demand for electricity in future and do so sustainably by connecting to renewable energy sources. We are at ""a moment in time that requires innovative thinking and bold actions to create a transmission network for tomorrow's future,"" Mr Pettigrew said. Most observers agree that whatever that future looks like, data centres will be a part of it. They have become integral to our modern lives and technologies, operating as a physical home to our digital information stored in the so-called ""cloud"" and other forms of IT equipment that power services and platforms. But all that computing power comes at an environmental cost. Some studies have warned that the AI industry alone could consume as much energy as a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 . The sector has been enjoying an economic boom after the launch of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and image-making tools such as Midjourney. Concern over their energy use and demands on infrastructure has increased in recent years. Official data showed that in the Republic of Ireland, which is home to the European headquarters of several big tech firms such as Google and Facebook-parent Meta, data centres accounted for nearly a fifth of all electricity used in 2022 . The amount of electricity being used by data centres in the country has risen by 400% since 2015 and ignited debate about capacity. Meanwhile, quantum computers, which process data differently to regular computers and can complete complex calculations very quickly, are still mostly being used experimentally to see what they can do. But it is hoped in future they could secure scientific breakthroughs and advance secure methods of communication.",2024-03-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68664182,tech
38,Payout for Uber Eats driver over face scan bias case,"A black Uber Eats driver has received a payout after ""racially discriminatory"" facial-recognition checks prevented him accessing the app to secure work. When Pa Edrissa Manjang began working for Uber Eats, in November 2019, its app did not regularly ask him to send selfies in order to register for jobs. But the Microsoft-powered Uber Eats app increased these verification checks. And in 2021, it said after ""careful consideration"" his account would be removed, due to ""continued mismatches"". An Uber representative said: ""Our real-time ID check is designed to help keep everyone who uses our app safe and includes robust human review to make sure that we're not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the App Drivers and Couriers Union funded Mr Manjang's case. The EHRC was concerned the artificial intelligence in the facial-recognition checks had deprived him of his income. The ADCU said the number of selfies Mr Manjang had been asked for amounted to racial harassment. The union told BBC News it was ""working hard"" to ensure workers' rights were protected as ""the pace of development of AI and machine-learning tools in the workplace accelerates"". Mr Manjang, who was reinstated and continues to work for Uber Eats, in Oxfordshire, said the out-of-court settlement marked the end of a ""long and difficult"" period for him. His case ""shines a spotlight"" on the potential problems with AI, particularly for ""low-paid workers in the gig economy"". And he hoped the decision would help strengthen ""rights and protections of workers in relation to AI, particularly ethnic minorities"". Baroness Falkner, who chairs the EHRC, said Mr Manjang should never have have had to sue Uber Eats to understand the opaque processes affecting his work. ""We are particularly concerned that Mr Manjang was not made aware that his account was in the process of deactivation, nor provided any clear and effective route to challenge the technology,"" she said. Microsoft has previously admitted its facial-recognition software works less well for people belonging to ethnic minorities. And previous cases, involving the police, Home Office and universities, have shown ethnicity can affect the technology.",2024-03-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68655429,tech
39,Elon Musk's X anti-hate group case thrown out,"A US judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's social media firm X against a group that had claimed that hate speech had risen on the platform since the tech tycoon took over. X had accused the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) of taking ""unlawful"" steps to access its data. The US judge dismissed the case and said it was ""evident"" Mr Musk's X Corp did not like criticism. X said it planned to appeal. Imran Ahmed, founder and chief executive of CCDH, celebrated the win, saying Mr Musk had conducted a ""loud, hypocritical campaign"" of harassment and abuse against his organisation in an attempt to ""avoid taking responsibility for his own decisions"". ""The courts today have affirmed our fundamental right to research, to speak, to advocate, and to hold accountable social media companies"" he said, adding that he hoped the ruling would ""embolden"" others to ""continue and even intensify"" similar work. It is a striking loss for the billionaire, a self-described ""free-speech absolutist"". The company, formerly known as Twitter, launched its lawsuit against CCDH in 2023, claiming its researchers had cherry-picked data to create misleading reports about X. It accused the group of ""intentionally and unlawfully"" scraping data from X, in violation of its terms of service, in order to produce its research. It said the non-profit group designed a ""scare campaign"" to drive away advertisers, and it demanded tens of millions of dollars in damages. But in his decision Judge Charles Breyer said Mr Musk was ""punishing the defendants for their speech"". Judge Breyer said X appeared ""far more concerned about CCDH's speech than it is its data collection methods"". He said the company had ""brought this case in order to punish CCDH for ... publications that criticised X Corp - and perhaps in order to dissuade others who might wish to engage in such criticism"". Mr Musk purchased the platform in 2022 for $44bn (£34bn) and swiftly embarked on a slew of controversial changes, sharply reducing its workforce with deep cuts to teams in charge of content moderation and other areas. His own posts have also drawn charges of anti-semitism, a claim he has denied.",2024-03-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68657840,tech
40,"Apple, Meta and Google to be investigated by the EU","The EU has announced investigations into some of the biggest tech firms in the world over uncompetitive practices. Meta, Apple, and Alphabet, which owns Google, are being looked into for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduced in 2022. If they are found to have broken the rules, the firms can face huge fines of up to 10% of their annual turnover. EU antitrust boss Margrethe Vestager and industry head Thierry Breton announced the investigations on Monday. Just six companies have obligations under the DMA, but they are also the world's largest tech firms: Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and ByteDance. None of the firms are actually based in Europe - five of them are in the US, while ByteDance has headquarters in Beijing. Three of them are now facing questions just two weeks after submitting their compliance reports, which will have been meticulously compiled. It comes three weeks after the EU fined Apple €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking competition laws over music streaming. Meanwhile, the United States accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market in a landmark lawsuit against the tech giant introduced last week . An Apple spokesperson says the company will constructively engage with the investigation and that they're confident that their plan complies with the Digital Markets Act. They added that their teams established a variety of mechanisms to comply with the EU's landmark legislation, as well as privacy and security protections for EU users. ""Throughout, we've demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to the European Commission and developers, listening and incorporating their feedback,"" they said. Meanwhile a Meta spokesperson said the firm's use of subscriptions as an alternative to advertising were ""a well-established business model across many industries"". ""We designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA... we will continue to engage constructively with the Commission,"" they said. Alphabet has been approached for comment. The EU said it will investigate five different possible acts of non-compliance in its announcement: The first two of these investigations concern what is known as ""anti-steering"" - and the EU says it believes the firms are making it difficult for apps to tell users about ways to pay less for their services outside of using app stores' own payment methods. Under the third point, the EU says that Apple is obliged to allow users to easily uninstall apps on their devices, change default settings and be given ""choice screens"" to let them use different browsers or search engines. The EU says Apple's web browser ""choice screen"" does not give people enough choice, and said that some apps, such as Apple Photos, cannot be deleted at all. According to Ms Vestager, the investigation will take around 12 months to complete - though Mr Breton later clarified it could take slightly longer. ""We suspect that the suggested solutions put forward by the three companies do not fully comply with the DMA,"" she said. ""We will now investigate the companies' compliance with the DMA, to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe."" The five cases are consumer-focused, and highly relatable to most people who use products from these companies, which is collectively billions of people worldwide. ""We're talking about the protection of our citizens, we can't just sit around and wait,"" said Thierry Breton, of the EU's decision to act straight away. There is however another reason potentially in mind: European Parliament elections are due to be held in June 2024. Dr Rupprecht Podszun, director of the Institute for Competition Law at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, called it ""a strong signal"" from the EU. ""The DMA is designed for quick results,"" he said. ""The cases that the Commission has selected go to the heart of the business models; these are not marginal issues for the gatekeepers. ""The legal battles will be tense, but we must always bear in mind that the Court of Justice will have the last word.""",2024-03-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68655093,tech
41,Apple becomes the latest tech giant under siege,"To understand how much the US government's new lawsuit strikes at the heart of the identity Apple has forged for itself, let's first consider the firm's fanbase. Apple has a unique position as a tech brand. I've sat through a lot of Apple events in my time, both virtually and in person, and one thing that always makes us journalists raise an eyebrow is the whooping and cheering from the audience every time a new feature, no matter how small or incremental, is announced. When a new hardware product goes on sale, Apple employees form a guard of honour outside stores and applaud its first buyers - some of whom will have camped outside for hours in advance, and spent thousands of dollars (who else could get away with charging $3,500/£3,499, for a VR headset?). People get tattoos of Apple's distinctive fruit logo. ""Apple is like a strange drug that you just can't quite get enough of,"" wrote Leander Kahney in his 2006 book The Cult of Mac. It is this ""strange drug"" or ""magical experience"", as Apple put it in a statement on Thursday, which is now under fire. So far, Apple's ethos is a wildly successful business model. As I write, the firm is worth $2.6 trillion. Analysis firm CCS Insight estimates that 72% of smartphone handsets bought in North America alone in the last three months of 2023 were iPhones. Samsung took 25%, leaving just 3% for everybody else in the handset business. One of Apple's big selling points is its focus on privacy and security. But the question is whether it achieves this by shutting out the competition. The tech giant has engineered an illegal monopoly in smartphones, according to the sweeping US Department of Justice lawsuit filed on Thursday. Apple routinely blocks web trackers - an irritation for web users but also an important revenue generator for other digital businesses. It also operates a ""walled garden"". This means all Apple products work seamlessly together, and every app, payment method and operating system update is vetted and approved by the tech giant. It is, effectively, a closed ecosystem and that keeps it secure. Developers fume that they have to pay to get in, and also have to follow Apple's strict rules: but Apple says in return they get access to an enormous marketplace of potential customers. The music streaming platform, Spotify, and Epic Games, which makes Fortnite, are the two biggest commercial names to make a vocal stand against this. Fortnite was removed from the App Store: Spotify hasn't gone as far, perhaps because it has millions of iPhone-based subscribers. Apple's biggest smartphone rival is Google's Android, which is a far more sprawling affair. Its operating system has to work across dozens of different devices made by various manufacturers over the years. As a result, it offers more consumer choice - and is inevitably also less secure. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is not the only authority deciding to take a closer look at Apple's unique position. On two occasions now the tech giant has very reluctantly prised open its gates - and both times were caused by the European Union. It was recently forced to open up to other app stores in Europe. It did so very hesitantly, with plenty of warnings about the evil lurking outside of its own digital paradise. Until recently the iPhone didn't even use the same charging cable as almost everything else - most models require a bespoke lightning cable. But the EU is bringing in a common charger rule, and Apple is now selling lightning cable adaptors, as well as changing its most recent model to far more ubiquitous USB-C port. The DOJ doesn't have the same power, however. This will be a court process in which it will have to convince a judge, and it doesn't have a very successful track record of doing that. ""The last time a US court found a Big Tech company guilty of monopolisation dates back to 2001 (Microsoft),"" notes Anne Witt, Professor of Law at EDHEC business school in France. That was about the dominance of Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer, which was installed by default in millions of machines running Windows. It's worth remembering, however, that Apple is not holding its customers hostage, forcing them into its embrace. ""Every case against Apple portrays its users as consumers with no free will. I really struggle with that,"" remarked Carolina Milanesi from tech industry analysis firm, Creative Strategies. I know I have friends with iPhones who have dismissed the ""faff"" of changing to another brand, even if they like the look of something different. But that doesn't mean that Apple is actively stopping them - although a throw-away comment once made by CEO Tim Cook has now come back to bite him. A reporter in an interview mentioned that he was unable to share a video with his mum, who had a different phone. ""Buy your mom an iPhone,"" the Apple CEO joked. Apple has vowed to ""vigorously"" fight the lawsuit and denies the claims.",2024-03-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68631756,tech
42,Watchdog assessing McDonald's and Greggs IT failures,"The payments watchdog is examining the tech outages that have caused chaos for a number of high-profile retail outlets over the last week. Greggs became the fourth major firm to suffer IT issues, following problems at McDonald's, Tesco and Sainsbury's. The Payments Systems Regulator (PSR) said it was reviewing the situation. ""The PSR is aware of the recent payment issues and is assessing their nature to determine whether any further action is needed,"" it said. The PSR is the UK's economic regulator for payment systems, seeking to ensure they work well for those that use them. If it identifies an issue with payments infrastructure resilience, it can pass the matter on to the Bank of England. Such systems are firmly in the spotlight after a series of technical glitches which left customers unable to make purchases. Sainsbury's could not fulfil most online grocery deliveries on Saturday due to issues with an overnight software update which also hit contactless payments in stores. Tesco was also forced to cancel a ""small number"" of orders. The day before, McDonald's restaurants around the world were unable to take orders due to a ""global technology system outage"". On Wednesday, bakery chain Greggs became the latest major retailer to see its IT systems fail in some stores. As a result of the outages being so close together, experts have suggested they could be linked, for example via a common network or payments infrastructure provider. Alan Stephenson-Brown, CEO of IT firm Evolve, said the fact there were several outages was also a ""timely reminder that even large corporations aren't immune to IT troubles."" He said the retailers would have lost millions of pounds. ""This highlights that digital disruption is a principal risk for many retailers. Ensuring contingency planning is in place is vital,"" Mr Stephenson-Brown said. Jamil Ahmed, an engineer at transaction firm Solace, said the potential for ""disruptions and vulnerabilities"" will grow as businesses rely more and more on digital transactions. ""The brick and mortar retail industry is facing a crossroads. Customers, accustomed to the constant uptime and reliability of online shopping, are demanding the same flawless digital experience from physical retailers,"" he said.",2024-03-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68628348,tech
43,Plans to boost resilience of 999 system announced,"The government has announced new measures it says will boost the resilience of the 999 system, following its worst outage in almost 90 years. A nationwide technical issue meant calls were not connected to emergency services in June 2023 . The government will increase its oversight of any future incidents and improve communications between emergency services. BT, which manages the system, says it ""fell short of its own high standards."" Ofcom is investigating the telecoms firm , which took responsibility for the fault, with the outcome expected in the coming months. ""The level of disruption to the service on Sunday 25 June 2023 has never been seen before and we are sincerely sorry for the distress caused,"" said BT security boss Howard Watson. ""As outlined in the Government's Post-Incident Review, we have put in place a comprehensive improvement plan to prevent this series of events reoccurring."" To improve its oversight of similar events in the future, the government will identify who is responsible and accountable for the 999 system in the face of different threats, such as cyber attacks and natural disasters. And it will identify a way to advise the public on what to do so people can contact emergency services if the 999 system becomes inaccessible across the UK. It said the plans would be in place by the end of April 2024. ""We are determined to prevent history from repeating itself, with public safety being absolutely paramount,"" said Technology minister Michelle Donelan. ""This is why, following a thorough review of the incident, we are working with BT to establish enhanced resilience measures, ensuring the UK is always prepared to effectively address major emergencies.""

44,NHS AI test spots tiny cancers missed by doctors,"An AI tool tested by the NHS successfully identified tiny signs of breast cancer in 11 women which had been missed by human doctors. The tool, called Mia, was piloted alongside NHS clinicians and analysed the mammograms of over 10,000 women. Most of them were cancer-free, but it successfully flagged all of those with symptoms, as well as an extra 11 the doctors did not identify. At their earliest stages, cancers can be extremely small and hard to spot. The BBC saw Mia in action at NHS Grampian, where we were shown tumours that were practically invisible to the human eye. But, depending on their type, they can grow and spread rapidly. Barbara was one of the 11 patients whose cancer was flagged by Mia but had not been spotted on her scan when it was studied by the hospital radiologists. Because her 6mm tumour was caught so early she had an operation but only needed five days of radiotherapy. Breast cancer patients with tumours which are smaller than 15mm when discovered have a 90% survival rate over the following five years. Barbara said she was pleased the treatment was much less invasive than that of her sister and mother, who had previously also battled the disease. She told me she met a relative who expressed sympathy that Barbara had ""the Big C"". ""I said, 'it's not a big C, it's a very little one',"" she said. Without the AI tool's assistance, Barbara's cancer would potentially not have been spotted until her next routine mammogram three years later. She had not experienced any noticeable symptoms. Because it works instantly, tools like Mia also have the potential to reduce the waiting time for results from 14 days down to three, claims its developer Kheiron. None of the cases in the trial were analysed by Mia alone - each had a human review as well. Currently two radiologists look at each individual scan, but the hope is that one of them could one day be replaced by the tool, effectively halving the workload for each pair. Of the 10,889 women who participated in the trial, only 81 did not want the AI tool to review their scans, said Dr Gerald Lip, clinical director of breast screening in the north east of Scotland and the doctor who led the project. AI tools are generally pretty good at spotting symptoms of a specific disease, if they are trained on enough data to enable them to be identified. This means feeding the programme with as many different anonymised images of those symptoms as possible, from as diverse a range of people as possible. Getting hold of this data can be difficult because of patient confidentiality and privacy concerns. Sarah Kerruish, Chief Strategy Officer of Kheiron Medical, said it took six years to build and train Mia, which is run on cloud computing power from Microsoft, and it was trained on ""millions"" of mammograms from ""women all over the world"". ""I think the most important thing I've learned is that when you're developing AI for a healthcare situation, you have to build in inclusivity from day one,"" she said. Breast cancer doctors look at around 5,000 breast scans per year on average, and can view 100 in a single session. ""There is an element of fatigue,"" said Dr Lip. ""You get disruptions, someone's coming in, someone's chatting in the background. There are lots of things that can probably throw you off your regular routine as well. And in those days when you have been distracted, you go, 'how on earth did I miss that?' It does happen."" I asked him whether he was worried that tools like Mia might one day take away his job altogether. He said he believed the tech could one day free him up to spend more time with patients. ""I see Mia as a friend and an augmentation to my practice,"" Dr Lip said. Mia isn't perfect. It had no access to any patient history so, for example, it would flag cysts which had already been identified by previous scans and designated harmless. Also, because of current health regulation, the machine learning element of the AI tool was disabled - so it could not learn on the job, and evolve during its use. Every time it was updated it had to undergo a new review. The Mia trial is just one early test, by one product in one location. The University of Aberdeen independently validated the research, but the results of the evaluation have not yet been peer reviewed. The Royal College of Radiologists say the tech has potential. ""These results are encouraging and help to highlight the exciting potential AI presents for diagnostics. There is no question that real-life clinical radiologists are essential and irreplaceable, but a clinical radiologist using insights from validated AI tools will increasingly be a formidable force in patient care."" said Dr Katharine Halliday, President of the Royal College of Radiologists. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK said the increasing number of cancer cases diagnosed each year meant technological innovation would be ""vital"" to help improve NHS services and reduce pressure on its staff. ""More research will be needed to find the best ways to use this technology to improve outcomes for cancer patients,"" she added. There are other healthcare-related AI trials going on around the UK, including an AI tool by a firm called Presymptom Health which is analysing blood samples looking for signs of sepsis before symptoms emerge - but many are still in early stages without published results.",2024-03-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68607059,tech
45,We rely heavily on lithium batteries – but there's a growing array of alternatives,"Lithium batteries are very difficult to recycle and require huge amounts of water and energy to produce. Emerging alternatives could be cheaper and greener. In Australia's Yarra Valley, new battery technology is helping power the country's residential buildings and commercial ventures – without using lithium. These batteries rely on sodium – an element found in table salt – and they could be another step in the quest for a truly sustainable battery. The global demand for batteries is surging as the world looks to rapidly electrify vehicles and store renewable energy. Lithium ion batteries, which are typically used in EVs, are difficult to recycle and require huge amounts of energy and water to extract . Companies are frantically looking for more sustainable alternatives that can help power the world's transition to green energy. ""Sodium is a much more sustainable source for batteries [than lithium],"" says James Quinn, chief executive of Faradion, the UK-based battery technology company that manufactures the sodium-ion batteries for Yarra Valley utility company Nation Energie. ""It's widely available around the world, meaning it's cheaper to source , and less water intensive to extract ,"" says Quinn. "" It takes 682 times more water to extract one tonne of lithium versus one tonne of sodium . That is a significant amount."" Faradion's sodium-ion batteries are already being used by energy companies around the world to store renewable electricity. And they are just one alternative to our heavy and growing reliance on lithium, which was listed by the European Union as a ""critical raw material"" in 2020 . The market size for the lithium battery is predicted to grow from $57bn (£45bn) in 2023, to $187bn (£150bn) by 2032 . To find promising alternatives to lithium batteries, it helps to consider what has made the lithium battery so popular in the first place. Some of the factors that make a good battery are lifespan, power, energy density, safety and affordability. The downsides are also plentiful: at the end of their lifespan, recycling these batteries is still a complicated process . Extracting individual metals in the battery for recycling involves shedding the metal , then separating them in liquid to extract the desired metal. ""Recycling a lithium-ion battery consumes more energy and resources than producing a new battery, explaining why only a small amount of lithium-ion batteries are recycled,"" says Aqsa Nazir, a postdoctoral research scholar at Florida International University's battery research laboratory. Lithium extraction using evaporation ponds, as is done in countries such as Chile, comes with a high water footprint . Studies show that contaminants may be released into the environment during the evaporation process, potentially affecting nearby communities. Water scarcity caused by mining could also threaten the livelihoods of indigenous communities . The overlap of mining sites with indigenous living areas has also led to forced migration and the abandonment of ancestral villages. An alternative to the evaporation method is hard rock mining , such as is done in Australia. But this has its own drawbacks. For every tonne of lithium mined during hard rock mining, approximately 15 tonnes of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. So, are there viable alternatives to the lithium-ion battery? In sodium-ion batteries, sodium directly replaces lithium. Not unlike lithium-ion batteries, sodium batteries contain four main components – the anode, the cathode, an electrolyte and a separator. The state of the electrolyte varies depending on the manufacturer. The sodium to lithium ratio in the earth's crust is 23,600 parts per million ( ppm ) to 20 ppm . The natural abundance of sodium leads to a much lower cost of extraction . Another factor for the sodium battery is that it can make use of other lower cost materials, replacing copper foils with aluminum foils , for instance. Maria Forsyth, chair of electromaterials and corrosion sciences at Deakin University, Australia, says that switching from lithium to sodium battery production would be fairly low cost. ""Manufacturing wise, the transition is easy because the same factories, which currently produce lithium-ion batteries, can manufacture sodium batteries,"" says Forsyth. ""This means production can be scaled quickly. One benefit of sodium batteries is their safety in transit. ""A unique feature of sodium ion technology is the ability to discharge sodium to zero volts for storage and transportation ,"" says Quinn, Faradion's chief executive. ""This means it can be stored and transported in safer conditions."" The lower flammability risk levels make it a safer option compared to lithium batteries, Quinn says.  One drawback, however, is low energy density. For EV manufacturers, low energy density batteries are problematic because this affects a vehicle's range . While lithium batteries have energy densities between 150-220 Wh/kg (watt-hour per kilogram), sodium batteries have an lower energy density range of 140-160 Wh/kg . Meng says this means it's less likely that sodium batteries will be commercially scaled for use in EVs that require long ranges between charges. Another hurdle is sodium batteries can only manage a short number of charging cycles in its lifespan. Currently, sodium batteries have a charging cycle of around 5,000 times, whereas lithium-iron phosphate batteries (a type of lithium-ion battery) can be charged between 8,000-10,000 times. But researchers are working to solve this – in 2023, scientists and engineers in China achieved 6,000 cycles using a different type of electrode . China's battery technology firm HiNa launched a 100 kWh energy storage power station in 2019 , demonstrating the feasibility of sodium batteries for large-scale energy storage. HiNa has also recently piloted a batch of sodium battery powered electric vehicles . Solid-state batteries use solid electrolytes, instead of the liquid or aqueous electrolytes common in traditional batteries. The two most popular types of solid electrolytes include inorganic solid electrolytes (oxides and sulfides) and solid polymers (polymer salts, or gel polymers). Using solid electrolytes reduces the risk of dendrite formation – those tree-like structures within the battery that can cause battery failure. Solid-state batteries also have a lower risk of flammability , a higher energy density and a faster charging cycle . However, solid-state batteries may be harder to scale quickly than sodium batteries, says Shirley Meng, professor of molecular engineering at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. ""Sodium batteries are lower in cost, and are easier to integrate into current lithium battery production plants."" Based on a 2020 calculation model, the manufacturing costs of solid state batteries are also currently higher than that of lithium ion batteries . To advance solid battery technology, it's essential to find durable solid-state electrolytes. Some researchers say an ideal solid electrolyte is yet to be found . However, Colorado-based Solid Power has designed a sulfide electrolyte-based battery which it claims is 50-100% higher in energy density than modern lithium ion batteries. Solid Power aims to scale its solid-state tech to power 800,000 electric vehicles per year by 2028. Solid-state batteries are currently commercially available in a thin-film format, making them an option for wearable electronics, ""internet of things"" (IoT) devices, for example home security systems and smart lighting. They can also be used in medical devices, such as llika's Stereax M300 , a hip implant device. But while these batteries have some small-scale uses, they aren't currently an option for large-scale energy storage. ""We need to be realistic,"" says Meng. ""Right now, perhaps solid-state batteries are viable for IoT and wearables. But for solid-state tech that can contribute to the energy transition, they will need to be scaled to produce terawatt hours (TWh) of energy."" Lithium-sulphur batteries are similar in composition to lithium-ion batteries – and, as the name suggests, they still use some lithium. The lithium is present in the battery's anode, and sulphur is used in the cathode. Lithium-ion batteries use rare earth minerals like nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) in their cathode. Sulphur is more abundant in the Earth's crust than nickel, manganese and cobalt and its extraction process is less resource intensive. It is also more widely available because it's the by-product of natural gas processing and oil refining. Though supplies of sulphur may fall over the next few decades due to global decarbonisation The US alone produces 8.6 million tonnes of sulphur a year . So although these batteries contain lithium, the abundance of sulphur makes them a potentially more sustainable option compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries, says Aqsa. ""When commercialised, this battery will likely be used for grid storage, though mobile use is also feasible in the longer term."" The similarity with lithium-ion batteries makes lithium-sulphur batteries relatively easy to produce. ""They can be manufactured in the same production plants, saving costs of new technical resources,"" says Nazir. Lithium-sulphur batteries also have additional functional advantages as they have a higher energy density, meaning they produce more power, Nazir adds. ""Sulphur has the capacity to move more electrons. Lithium-sulphur batteries have nine times the energy density of a lithium-ion battery."" However these batteries suffer from poor chargeability. The formation of tree-like structures called dendrites can lead to short circuiting and battery failure. With prototypes working for as little as 50 charge cycles , they aren't yet feasible for use in EVs, for example. Lithium-sulphur batteries are already on the market, where they are used for gadgets requiring batteries with a lighter weight and a longer single charge time. In 2020, Korean chemicals company LG Energy Solutions successfully piloted a drone powered by a lithium-sulphur battery , and confirmed that the battery had a stable charge and discharge cycles. The firm intends to mass produce lithium-sulphur batteries with double the intensity of lithium-ion batteries by 2027. Meanwhile the German battery startup Theion is also working to bring lithium-sulphur batteries to electric vehicles . If one thing is clear, it's that no single battery type is going to be a universal answer to replacing lithium ion batteries. But as Forsyth points out, that's not a bad thing. ""We don't need to replace the lithium in all batteries, what is needed is a diversification of battery technology,"" says Forsyth. ""Maybe it's not having one replacement but having alternatives that can be deployed where it's right to deploy them."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",2024-03-20,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240319-the-most-sustainable-alternatives-to-lithium-batteries,tech
46,Fraud risk for Vans customers after data breach,"Customers of the footwear brand Vans have been warned they may be at risk of fraud or identity theft following a data breach at its parent company. VF Group detected ""unauthorised activities"" on a part of its IT systems in December 2023, Vans say. It says no detailed financial information or passwords were stolen. But it added that ""it cannot be excluded"" that criminals could attempt to misuse the customer data they had obtained. VF Group also owns other brands including Timberland, The North Face and Dickies. The BBC has asked the company if customers of those brands are also affected. In an email to its customers , Vans says the data breach was first detected by VF Group on 13 December, and was ""apparently carried out by external threat actors."" The company says it ""immediately took steps"" to deal with the threat, including shutting down affected IT systems and hiring cybersecurity experts. By 15 December, it says, the hackers were ejected. ""Our investigation revealed that the incident has affected some personal information of our customers, that we normally store and process in order to manage online purchases, such as email address, full name, phone number, billing address, shipping address,"" the email said. But it added the firm did not ""collect or retain"" payment or financial data, such as bank account or credit card information, so there was ""no chance that any detailed financial information was exposed to the threat actors."" It said it had no information of customers being affected so far but warned the incident ""may result in attempts of identity theft, phishing and possibly fraud in general."" It has advised customers to be careful of suspicious emails, texts and telephone calls asking for personal information. Vans says it has contacted the relevant law enforcement agencies and says it will review its cybersecurity policies.",2024-03-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68615042,tech
47,British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman joins Microsoft,"Microsoft has announced British Artificial Intelligence pioneer Mustafa Suleyman will lead its newly-formed division, Microsoft AI. Mr Suleyman currently heads start-up Inflection AI, but is best known for co-founding AI firm DeepMind. It was one of the UK's best known AI firms and was bought by Google in 2014. Mr Suleyman's move cements Microsoft's reputation as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), a field in which Google is appearing to struggle. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Suleyman said he was ""excited"" to take up his new position, adding that he would be taking several colleagues to Microsoft with him, including ""friend and long time collaborator"" Karén Simonyan as chief scientist. He said he would be ""leading all consumer AI products and research"", including the Copilot chatbot, Bing and Edge. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella described Mr Suleyman as a ""visionary, product maker, and builder of pioneering teams that go after bold missions"". ""I am excited for them to contribute their knowledge, talent, and expertise to our consumer AI research and product making,"" he added. After leaving Google in 2022, Mr Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI, which has emerged as one of the most high-flying names in the generative AI race after raising $1.3bn from Microsoft and Nvidia last June. But taking up his latest position at Microsoft cements his respect in the field. Microsoft has invested billions into its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and recently in the French tech start-up Mistral AI. Microsoft said it would continue to build AI infrastructure and work in support of OpenAI's ""foundation model roadmap"". It is a different picture at Google currently though. There have been a number of issues around the tech giant's new AI-powered tool, Gemini, which refused to depict white people and changed the race of certain white historical figures. Google has apologised for ""inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions"", saying its attempts at creating a ""wide range"" of results missed the mark. If you want to know who's edging ahead on the AI race, look at the movement of its key players. Mustafa Suleyman's appointment nudges our imaginary swingometer firmly in the direction of the Seattle-based tech giant. The message could not be more clear: Microsoft""s long-term strategy of investing hugely in AI is paying off. Mr Suleyman left Google to launch his own company two years ago but until now he's remained a a high profile supporter of Team Google - or so it seemed. It must be infuriating for Google to watch. On paper Google has it all: money, expertise, infrastructure, data access and a huge user base. And yet somehow it has not found its groove, not helped by a series of PR missteps. Reports of a collaboration with its arch rival Apple, while unconfirmed by both parties, would give its AI brand Gemini a much-needed shot in the arm. But for now it finds itself increasingly sidelined in a race that, you would think, it began in pole position.",2024-03-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68607060,tech
48,Is TikTok really a danger to the West?,"China has attacked a bill going through US Congress that could ultimately see TikTok banned in the States, calling it unjust. It is the latest move in a years-long row over safety fears about the app which is owned by a Chinese company. Officials, politicians and security staff in many Western countries have been banned from installing it on work phones. So what are the three biggest cyber concerns about TikTok, and how does the company respond to them? TikTok says the app's data collection is ""in line with industry practices"". Critics frequently accuse TikTok of harvesting huge amounts of data. A cyber-security report published in July 2022 by researchers at Internet 2.0, an Australian cyber-company, is often cited as evidence. Researchers studied the app's source code and reported it carries out ""excessive data harvesting"". Analysts said TikTok collects details such as location, what specific device is being used and which other apps are on it. However, a similar test carried out by Citizen Lab concluded ""in comparison to other popular social media platforms, TikTok collects similar types of data to track user behaviour"". Similarly, a report by the Georgia Institute of Technology last year stated: ""The key fact here is that most other social media and mobile apps do the same things."" TikTok says the company is fully independent and ""has not provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we if asked"". Although it irks privacy experts, most of us accept that handing over swathes of private data is the deal we make with social networks. In exchange for giving us their services free of charge they gather knowledge about us and use it to sell advertising on their platform, or sell our data to other firms trying to advertise to us elsewhere on the internet. The issue that critics have with TikTok is that it is owned by Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, making it unique as a non-American mainstream app. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, for example, all collect similar amounts of data but are all US-founded companies. For years, US lawmakers, along with most of the rest of the world, have assumed a level of trust: that the data collected by these platforms will not be used for nefarious reasons which might put national security at risk. Donald Trump's 2020 executive order alleged TikTok's data collection could potentially allow China to ""track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage "". So far, evidence points to this being only a theoretical risk - but fears are stoked by a vague piece of Chinese law passed in 2017. Article seven of China's National Intelligence Law states that all Chinese organisations and citizens should ""support, assist and co-operate"" with the country's intelligence efforts. This sentence is often cited by people suspicious not just of TikTok, but all Chinese companies. However, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology argue this sentence is taken out of context, and note that the law also includes caveats protecting the rights of users and private companies. Since 2020, TikTok executives have repeatedly tried to reassure people that Chinese staff cannot access the data of non-Chinese users. But in 2022, ByteDance admitted that several of its Beijing-based employees did access the data of at least two journalists in the US and UK to track their locations and check whether they were meeting TikTok employees suspected of leaking information to the media. TikTok's spokeswoman says the employees who accessed the data were dismissed. The firm insists user data has never been stored in China and is building data centres in Texas for US user data, and at sites in Europe for data from its citizens. In the EU the company has also gone much further than any other social network and enlisted an independent cyber-security company to oversee all use of data at its European sites. TikTok says ""data of our European users is safeguarded in a specially designed protective environment, and can only be accessed by approved employees subject to strict independent oversight and verification."" TikTok argues that its community guidelines "" prohibit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public, which includes engaging in co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour"". In November 2022, Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told US lawmakers: ""The Chinese government could… control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations."" The claim has been repeated many times. Those concerns are further inflamed by the fact that TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - is heavily censored and reportedly engineered to encourage educational and wholesome material to go viral for its young user base. All social networks are heavily censored in China, with an army of internet police deleting content which criticises the government or excites political unrest. At the start of TikTok's ascendancy, there were high-profile cases of censorship on the app: a user in the US had her account suspended for discussing Beijing's treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. After a fierce public backlash, TikTok apologised and reinstated the account. Since then there have been few cases of censorship, other than the sort of controversial moderation decisions with which all platforms have to deal. Researchers at Citizen Lab carried out a comparison of TikTok and Douyin. They concluded that TikTok does not employ the same political censorship. ""The platform does not enforce obvious post censorship,"" researchers said in 2021. Georgia Institute of Technology analysts also searched for topics such as the independence of Taiwan or jokes about Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, and concluded: ""Videos in all of these categories can easily be found on TikTok. Many are popular and widely shared."" The overall picture, then, is one of theoretical fears - and theoretical risk. Critics argue TikTok is a ""Trojan horse"" - although it looks harmless, it could prove to be a powerful weapon during times of conflict, for example. The app is already banned in India, which took action in 2020 against the app and dozens of other Chinese platforms. But a US ban on TikTok could have a huge impact on the platform, since typically US allies often fall in step with such decisions. That was apparent when the US successfully led calls to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from being deployed in 5G infrastructure - again, based on theoretical risks. It is worth noting, of course, that these risks are a one-way street. China does not have to worry about US apps because access for Chinese citizens has been blocked for many years.",2024-03-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64797355,tech
49,Government wants flying taxis to take off in 2 years,"The first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and become a regular sight in our skies two years later, if a government announcement goes to plan. The Future of Flight action plan, developed with the aerospace industry, also says drones and other flying vehicles will become more autonomous. It predicts that the first pilotless flying taxi will take off in 2030. But experts say hurdles such as infrastructure and public acceptance need to be overcome first. There are a number of different models, but most flying taxis look like a futuristic helicopter and can usually carry about five people. They are part of a family of vehicles called ""eVTOLs"" - which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The technology for them exists now, but it is likely that the aircraft will start off as exclusive modes of transport - replacing expensive journeys currently done by helicopters. The Department for Transport also plans to allow drones to fly beyond visual line of sight - meaning the person controlling the drone cannot see it in the air. Some of the uses of unmanned drones include transporting medical supplies, delivering post in rural areas and tracking down criminals on the run. Their use is still in early stages, but the plan suggests drone deliveries would be commonplace by 2027. The biggest obstacles to getting flying taxis into the air are infrastructure and public perception, says Craig Roberts, head of drones, at consultancy firm PwC. Last year, he co-authored a report on the topic , in collaboration with the government, on the viability of the technology. ""It's challenging, but possible,"" he says of the 2026 target. Mr Roberts thinks that the most efficient use of the technology is in ""longer distance, higher occupancy cases"". The government's report gives an example of flying from Liverpool to Leeds in 26 minutes. ""It might start off as being more of a replacement for helicopters,"" he says, before demand slowly spreads to the wider population. The convenience would also have to be demonstrated to the wider public through technological advances in security screening. The PwC report assumes a scenario where it takes 10 minutes from arrival at a flying taxi rank to taking off - currently challenging, given the length of time it takes to get through a conventional airport. ""The industry knows this is a problem and knows it has to be solved... But there are technological ways of doing this,"" Mr Roberts says. ""What was holding this back for a long time was the barriers to certification of a new technology,"" says Dr Nadjim Horri, lecturer in aerospace control at the University of Leicester. However, he says that this is changing, with regulation starting to catch up with technological progress in the field. He adds that it would also require confidence from the public to adopt the new technology but that 2026 is a realistic aim to get flying taxis into the air. The proposals would require new infrastructure developments in the UK, such as ""mini airports"" for drones. A mini airport was set up for four weeks in a car park near central Coventry in 2022 as a proof of concept. The company behind it, Urban Air Port, sees the future of air taxis as additional to, rather than a replacement of, current modes of transport. Its chief executive Andrea Wu says that transport hubs should be in urban centres but ""there has not been enough investment in infrastructure"" in the UK so far. She calls the suggestion of flying taxis becoming a regular sight by 2028 an ""ambitious timeline"" given the need to build places for them to take off and land. ""But the whole industry agrees you have to put something down on paper in order to push this forward,"" Ms Wu says of Monday's announcement. No other mini airports have been built or trialled since the demonstration two years ago. But according to the government plan, the first vertiport (airport for vertical vehicles) will be operational this year. The UK's aerospace regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, is consulting on proposals for vertiports at existing aerodromes. New regulation would almost certainly need to be created if the government's aim of bringing in autonomous air taxis by 2030 is to be met.",2024-03-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68597045,tech
50,"In Cleveland, mushrooms digest entire houses: How fungi can be used to clean up pollution","In the struggle to combat pollution and fight climate change, a growing number of scientists are beginning to look to one of nature’s oldest biotechnologies: fungi. The city of Cleveland faces an epidemic of abandoned houses. Crumbling homes number in the thousands . These ramshackle structures are riddled with toxins like lead and dilapidated to the point of no return. And if tearing down and safely disposing of the waste of one such home sounds daunting, imagine thousands of them. Among the numerous issues that arise, one essential question involves waste. What do you do with the waste material from so many teardown structures, when so much of it is toxic? ""All of the material from demolition – the studs, the floors, cellulosic mass [the primary structural component of plants], and even things like ceiling tiles and asphalt material like roof shingles , can be mixed into substrate that then becomes good for growing fungus,"" says Chris Maurer, founder of Cleveland-based architect firm Redhouse Studio . Through his firm, Maurer has been advocating for the use of substrate to address Cleveland's housing crisis, which is also a health crisis for the city's inhabitants. Substrate is any material that mycelium – the thready, vegetative part of fungi – uses for nourishment. In other words, fungi can eat the noxious waste from the abandoned homes. Heavy metals and other toxins are extracted and captured in the mushrooms that grow, while the substrate leftovers, including the mycelium, are compacted and heated to create clean bricks for new construction. The resulting ""mycoblocks"" have a consistency akin to hardwood and, depending on the specifics of the manufacturing process, have been shown to be significantly stronger than concrete . This is Redhouse's Biocycler program, which is one of many diverse efforts around the world aiming to eliminate pollution, combat climate change, and mitigate its already-looming effects via one of nature's oldest biotechnologies: fungi. ""Effectively what we're doing is diverting tonnage from landfill,"" says Joanne Rodriguez, founder and chief executive of a similar organisation called Mycocycle , which works to recycle construction waste for corporate clients. ""[Because] 11% of the world's carbon comes from materials in the built environment. By 2027, just from Mycocyle's waste diversion, Rodriguez anticipates carbon reductions ""of close to 160,000 metric tons."" While digesting entire houses may seem like a mighty task for the humble mushroom, some species' ability to devour waste and eradicate pollutants – among other characteristics – means they present an oversized opportunity to extract harmful toxins from both our built and natural environments. Along the way they may help to address a spectrum of additional ecological concerns. This is the emerging field of mycoremediation, which researchers assert could also create a "" circular bioeconomy "" in which less waste and contaminants are produced in the first place. Its applications are abundant. In Delhi, India, the hope is that fungi will help to clean the infamously polluted air . In New Zealand, mushrooms have been used to filter oil from a canal . Operating across Europe, the LIFE MySOIL project has leveraged mycoremediation to reduce Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in soil by 90% spanning three pilot sites. The list goes on. ""As primary decomposers in the environment, many species of fungi are designed to break down complex carbon chain molecules like wood, composed of lignin and cellulose,"" says ecologist Brendan O'Brien, executive director of CoRenewal , a bioremediation non-profit. In order to do so, they produce enzymes to break the bonds of those complex molecules, he says. ""They are therefore often able to break down other persistent organic pollutants with similar chemical structures."" Fungi have been observed breaking down pollutants such as petroleum , ""forever chemicals"" known as PFAS , herbicides, and pesticides. By sequestering and immobilising contaminants like heavy metals in their tissues, fungi can even help eliminate lead . These clean-up methods could prove a boon to ethnic minority communities who tend to be disproportionately impacted by environmental toxins . Research has shown a direct correlation between minority status and the presence of soil contamination . CoRenewal works to develop and implement sustainable solutions to restore damaged ecosystems, from post-wildfire regeneration, to cleaning up oil spills, to reducing toxins in the built environment. The organisation began with the mission of cleaning crude oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon using oyster mushrooms, which are well known for their ability to break down petroleum and hydrocarbons . They shifted their efforts to post-wildfire cleanup in the wake of Northern California wildfires in 2017 , applying fungal materials to prevent toxic ash runoff from entering fresh waterways and regenerate ecosystems damaged by fire. Currently they're testing the effectiveness of this treatment in five wildfire hotspots along the US' West Coast and expect to have results by early 2024. While the ability of some fungi to eliminate petroleum is well-documented , there are numerous studies underway to discover what else these mysterious mycelia can do. Their impact on PFAS, chemicals used in everyday items such as cleaning products and waterproof clothing that have been found to negatively impact our health , has been more speculative – until recently. In 2022, researchers at Texas A&M University have developed a technique that allows white rot fungus to successfully break down PFAS . ""Bioremediation is more sustainable and cost effective than many other means to treat PFAS,"" says Susie Dai, a professor of plant pathology and microbiology at Texas A&M University and one of the researchers behind the study. ""For example, thermal destruction is commercially available, but it is very energy intensive."" She points out that using heat to break down the chemicals can be more cost effective for condensed quantities of PFAS, but that ""bioremediation is more viable to be applied at larger scales"". Now, her team is searching for fungus strains that have stronger capacities to remove and break down PFAS chemicals. The elimination of these persistent, increasingly prevalent chemicals may prove to be beneficial to long-term human and environmental health. While the jury is out on precisely what risk PFAS pose to human health, ""animal model studies suggested that some PFAS may affect growth and development at large dosages"", says Dai. ""Other animal studies suggested health risks in reproduction, thyroid function, the immune system, and the liver."" And as with contaminated soil, communities of colour are more likely to be exposed to harmful levels of PFAS. The potential dangers have made the elimination of PFAS a priority among many bioremediation researchers. For another example, a research team at the University of Minnesota is currently putting together a scientific paper on its work to demonstrate that certain fungal species can ""defluorinate"" the harmful chemicals, which decreases their toxicity. ""The fluorinated carbon bond chemically is the strongest bond in the world,"" explains Jiwei Zhang, assistant professor of environment and industrial microbiology at University of Minnesota. ""That's why it's so difficult to deal with. But our research – which is still preliminary found that some fungal species can break down this resilient bond. That by itself is a fundamental achievement. Our next step is trying to understand the underlying mechanisms."" As research continues, experts are confident that the potential applications of mycoremediation will expand. ""We've only scratched the surface on the capabilities of mycelium. I think mycelium will be the unsung hero of climate change,"" predicts Rodriguez. More like this: • The world's most polluted capital city • The mushroom revolution that's bringing change • The mushrooms you can wear and build with But, warns Zhang, we would be wise to proceed with caution. ""Using fungi as a technology for remediating the environment, you might break the eco-balance because you're introducing new bio-conditions to the ecosystem. So you want to be very careful. We're culturing a lot of mushrooms right now and they're getting released into the natural forest environment, and usually the mushrooms released from farms are very competitive. They can kick out other mushrooms. It's a big concern for the conservation of natural mushroom species."" In spite of Zhang's concerns, fungi may still prove to be a boon to humanity's endeavours to live more environmentally-consciously. For example, Maurer is also experimenting with mycoremediation and mycoconstruction in Namibia, where homes built of mycoblocks offer a potential solution to the country's rampant housing crisis , which is fuelled largely by the growing issue of climate displacement. In fact, Maurer recently built what may be the first ever house constructed entirely of mycoremediated material. While working in Namibia, Maurer learned about the relationship between termites and a species of Namibian mushrooms called omajowa. The termites gather leaves in their mounds which they use to cultivate omajowa mycelium to two ends. First, the mycelium helps break down the leaf material for easier digestion. Second, it creates a humid environment through which air flows, and thanks to evaporative cooling this essentially provides an air conditioner for the mound. Each year when the omajowa mushrooms sprout from the mounds, Namibians collect and eat them. This is the perfect metaphor for various myco-efforts: collaborating with a natural, almost primordial technology for exceedingly practical purposes. Something old—older than humanity itself—becomes something new. Well, perhaps new to humans. Those mycelium-cultivating termites might beg to differ. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",2024-03-16,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240314-fungi-can-be-used-to-clean-pollution-and-combat-climate-change,tech
51,How the iron lung paved the way for the modern-day intensive care unit,"With the passing of iron lung patient Paul Alexander, a look back at how the device paved the way for subsequent life-saving medical innovations. Long before the polio vaccine , there was the iron lung . A large, cumbersome device that, by some accounts, looked like a ""coffin with legs,"" the iron lung was groundbreaking in its day. The device enabled hundreds of individuals to survive polio, a viral infection that attacks the body and can lead to paralysis and death within a matter of hours as breathing muscles become immobilised. However, with the iron lung, a massive machine that encases patients and provides air pressure to help the impacted individual's paralysed lungs function, life could continue for years. Such was the case for Paul Alexander, known globally as ""The Man in the Iron Lung"" , who died this week at the age of 78. Alexander contracted polio in 1952, when he was just six years old, leaving him paralysed from the neck down. Although he made tremendous progress learning to breathe on his own for short periods of time – he attended school and practised as a lawyer – Alexander lived the remainder of his life relying on the iron lung to survive. Developed in 1927 by a faculty member from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, industrial hygienist Philip Drinker, the iron lung was first used to save the life of a child in 1928 . It swiftly became a fixture in polio wards during the polio outbreaks of the subsequent decades, particularly from 1948 until the vaccine was developed in 1955. And its creation paved the way for many subsequent medical innovations. During the early 20th century, polio outbreaks were occurring around the world, spread via contaminated food and water. And up until the 1955 vaccine, the iron lung was the primary mode of treatment for severe cases and was considered state-of-the-art technology. A giant, airtight metal cylinder that weighs as much as 650lb (295kg) that's connected to a bellows, the iron lung requires polio patients to slide inside up to their neck. The bellows, which is attached to a pump, continuously cycles air in and out of the box, helping the patients continue breathing by sucking the chest open, forcing air to rush in to fill the lungs. This form of artificial respiration is known as External Negative Pressure Ventilation (ENPV). ""The invention of the iron lung irrevocably changed the relationship between humans and machines,"" says Hannah Wunsch, a critical care physician with Weill Cornell Medical Center Anesthesiology and author of The Autumn Ghost, a book that traces how intensive care units and mechanical ventilation are the foundation of modern medical care. ""For the first time, an individual struggling to breathe for an extended period of time could receive support, with the machine doing some or all of the work of breathing."" Some patients spent just a short time in the iron lung, perhaps weeks or months until they were able to regain chest strength and breath independently again. But for patients whose chest muscles were permanently paralysed, the iron lung remained the key to survival. While it was a lifesaving development, there were also many limitations with the iron lung for both patients and medical providers. Many patients felt trapped inside of the device, and it was difficult for doctors to access a patient's body and provide treatment to someone encased in the iron lung. But the invention, nevertheless, laid the foundation for many future medical advances. ""That concept of supporting an organ, such as the lungs, became the centrepiece of modern critical care,"" says Wunsch. The development of the iron lung is often seen as a milestone in the development of mechanical ventilators, which were not widely used prior to the polio outbreak. ""Ventilation science came into brighter lighting as a result of the iron lung,"" says Peter Gay , a pulmonary, critical care and sleep physician with the Mayo Clinic. ""The physiology of gas exchange was better understood once they mechanised moving air in and out of the body."" One of the early ventilator developments was pioneered by Bjorn Aage Ibsen. In 1953, Ibsen proposed using ""positive pressure"" ventilation. In contrast to the iron lung, which relied on negative pressure ventilation that suctioned air into a patient's lungs, positive pressure ventilation would push air into the lungs by hand, without the aid of machine. Subsequent ventilator developments, which blow air into the lungs, were more portable than the iron lung – and far less cumbersome and invasive. This type of positive pressure approach would later be used routinely in the operating room by anesthesiologists. While ventilator technology has evolved dramatically over the years and expanded, it remains very similar in concept to what was developed early on. Modern ventilators that sit at a patient's bedside delivering positive pressure in an intensive care unit can be traced back to the polio epidemic. The development of iron lung technology ""created the concept that you could put a whole lot of people into a room and support them with this life-saving gas exchange that they needed,"" adds Gay. Thus, the idea of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was born. According to the Respiratory Care Journal , ""The first ICUs were set up to manage in some cases dozens of patients, of all ages, requiring negative-pressure ventilation because of poliomyelitis [polio]."" ""You had these units with all of these polio patients using the iron lung, and that's where the idea of intensive care units really took off,"" continues Gay. ""That's why anesthesiologists initially became the critical care experts. Because anesthesiologists were largely the first to administer this type of intensive care."" More like this: • The drug pilots take to stay awake • Women's fertility is more complicated than you might have heard • What can you absorb through your skin? Wunsch concurs, pointing out that ""creating respiratory centres for the care of polio patients supported by iron lungs helped cement the idea that complex care of patients required a dedicated area, with highly skilled caregivers. This concept is also very much at the heart of modern ICUs."" Equally important, the ability to support a patient’s respiratory system more effectively has allowed for better treatment of many other critical illnesses. ""So often, when people have critical illness, respiratory failure accompanies the illness – when patients are septic, or have pneumonia or infections – the respiratory system has to be supported in order for any other organ failure to be recovered,"" adds Gay. Polio was feared around the world at the peak of its epidemic. The disease left hundreds of thousands of children paralysed each year. The iron lung helped save many of them: In the United States alone, it was used by 1,200 people in 1959. Fast-forward to late 2019 and early 2020, and the world one again found itself grappling with a frightening disease. During the Covid-19 pandemic peak, ventilation was once again at the forefront of treatment. Most recently, a team of engineers and doctors has invented the modern version of the iron lung – technology that serves as a breathing aid for patients with Covid-19. The new device, which is still in development and has not yet been brought to market, is named Exovent NPV. It is also a negative pressure ventilator, and works by decreasing ""the pressure outside the body to allow lung tissue to expand and function in a way that resembles normal breathing,"" according to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. There is also hope that the device may be used to help with conditions such as pneumonia. The Exovent is merely the latest example of a medical innovation that can trace its roots back to the invention of the iron lung. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",2024-03-15,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240315-iron-lung-led-to-creation-of-modern-day-intensive-care-unit,tech
52,Norfolk County Council beats Apple in £385m iPhone row,"Apple has agreed to pay $490m (£385m) to settle a lawsuit led by Norfolk County Council. The class action alleged the tech giant's boss, Tim Cook, defrauded shareholders by covering up lower demand for iPhones in China. The council said a pension fund it administered lost money as a result of Mr Cook's actions. In a statement, the Norfolk Pension Fund said it was ""very proud of this recovery for investors"". The statement continued: ""We are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals. ""When and where it's warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants' investments are harmed by fraud."" The BBC has approached Apple for comment. The class action lawsuit - meaning it is on behalf of a group of claimants - centred around comments made by Apple's chief executive Tim Cook. He told investors on 1 November 2018 that there was ""sales pressure"" in some countries but he ""would not put China in that category"". However, two months later, on 2 January 2019, Apple downgraded its quarterly revenue forecast, citing tensions between China and the US - leading to a sharp drop in Apple's share price. Within that two-month window, reports emerged that Apple had told its top smartphone assemblers to ""halt plans for additional production lines"" for the recently released iPhone XR. The claimants in this case were all investors who had bought shares between November 2018 and January 2019. They said they lost money because they had been falsely reassured by Mr Cook's comments in November. The case was originally brought against Apple and Mr Cook by the US city of Roseville. Norfolk County Council, which administers the £4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020. Apple had fought the litigation, and a trial was scheduled for later this year. This preliminary settlement - filed on Friday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California - should mean that will no longer happen, however it still requires approval by a judge. It is not known what portion of the settlement Norfolk County Council will receive. Apple posted $97 billion of net income in the last fiscal year. The pay-out equals a little under two days of profit for what is one of the world's wealthiest companies.",2024-03-15,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68580235,tech
53,Judge rules computer scientist not Bitcoin inventor,"The judge overseeing a legal battle about who invented Bitcoin has ruled that it is not Australian computer scientist Craig Wright. The question had been examined in a five week trial at the High Court. The judge, Mr Justice Mellor, made his ruling as soon as the proceedings had concluded. He had been expected to retire to consider the case but said he was able to reach a decision so quickly because the ""evidence was overwhelming"". Bitcoin is the world's best known cryptocurrency - and has recently captured the headlines after surging to a new record high valuation. But the identity of the person or people who invented it has always been unknown, other than they go by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Dr Wright, who is from Australia, has claimed to be Satoshi since 2016 - but his claims and evidence to back them up have long been questioned by cryptocurrency experts. He has been in and out of court for years in legal battles with individuals who challenged his story. This case, heard at the Intellectual Property Court, a division of London's High Court, was brought by a group of Bitcoin companies. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) - whose members include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's payments firm, Block - accused Dr Wright of creating a chilling effect on the development of the cryptocurrency because of his aggressive legal cases. During the hearing, COPA's legal team said Dr Wright had carried out a ""a massive campaign of dishonesty and forgery"". It even accused him of forging fresh documents while the proceedings were ongoing. COPA's lawyer, Jonathan Hough, said elements of Dr Wight's conduct ""stray into farce"" - but he told the court it also had ""deadly serious"" consequences. ""On the basis of his dishonest claim to be Satoshi, he has pursued claims he puts at hundreds of billions of dollars, including against numerous private individuals,"" he told the trial. Throughout the trial Dr Wright's legal team argued that if he was not the inventor then the real Satoshi Nakamoto would have come forward to discredit him. Mr Justice Mellor agreed that Dr Wright was not who he said he was. ""Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto"", he told the court. ""Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system."" He said he would give a full written judgement in due course.",2024-03-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68567320,tech
54,AI weapons scanner Evolv backtracks on UK testing claims,"An AI weapons-scanning company has backtracked on claims its technology has been tested by the UK government. Evolv Technology makes ""intelligent"" scanners designed to replace metal detectors by identifying people with concealed guns, knives and bombs. But the company has come under mounting criticism for overstating what the technology can deliver. Evolv told BBC News it had altered its claims about UK testing to ""better reflect the process taken"". The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into the company last month. And in October the company revealed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was looking into its marketing practices. As well as in many large stadiums and hundreds of schools in the US, Evolv scanners are used in the Manchester Arena. The company had said that its AI weapons scanner had been tested by the UK Government's National Protective Security Authority (NPSA) On 20 February the company put out a press release, including a claim that the NPSA was one of a number of testers who had ""concluded that the Evolv Express solution was highly effective at detecting firearms and many other types of weapons"". But BBC News can reveal the NPSA does not do this type of testing. When BBC News put this to Evolv, the company said: ""After discussion with NPSA, we updated the language used in the February 20 press release to better reflect the process taken."" Instead, it said: an independent company had ""tested and validated"" Evolv's technology, using NPSA standards. But the UK company that did this testing, Metrix NDT, told BBC News it was ""not correct to say we 'validated' the system"". Metrix NDT managing director Nick Fox told BBC News that Evolv's system had indeed been tested against NPSA specifications. But when asked if Metrix NDT had found it ""highly effective at detecting firearms and many other types of weapons"", he said: ""It is not within our remit to pass any value judgements on the results."" Evolv told the BBC that in addition to those results, Evolv makes available to any serious prospective customer full third-party testing reports for detection performance. Prof Marion Oswald, who was on the government's Centre of Data Ethics and Innovation advisory board until last year, told BBC News it was worrying the technology was replacing ""tried and tested"" security options. ""It does highlight the need for really close scrutiny and potential additional regulation of companies making these types of claims,"" she told BBC News. And she worried how customers might be influenced, ""especially if claims are being made about how certain government bodies may have been involved"". Evolv has previously said its technology detects the ""signatures"" of concealed weapons. ""Metallic composition, shape, fragmentation - we have tens of thousands of these signatures, for all the weapons that are out there,"" chief executive Peter George said, in 2021, ""all the guns, all the bombs and all the large tactical knives."" But the company has faced criticism it cannot reliably detect knives or bombs. Evolv now says it can detect ""many types of knives and some explosives"". In 2022, following a Freedom of Information request by the security-analysis company Internet Protocol Video Market (IPVM), BBC News revealed that testing by a US facility had found Evolv's technology could not consistently detect knives and certain types of bombs. Evolv should inform potential clients, the testers said. But during that investigation, in August 2022, Evolv had also told BBC News the NPSA (then called the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure CPNI) had tested its system. ""We have tested with the UK CPNI,"" a representative told BBC News. A Home Office official said: ""We are looking to further understand the capabilities of weapons-detection equipment."" Evolv also amended another claim in its 20 February press release.  Evolv had initially referred to the designation of its technology under the US Department of Homeland Security Safety (DHS) Act as an example of recent ""third party testing"". This was later changed so as to reflect the fact that this designation does not involve the conduct of a new test by the DHS but is an evaluation of other evidence. In May last year, BBC News revealed further details of a stabbing in a New York school that used Evolv scanners. Proctor High School's then superintendent, Brian Nolan, said: ""Through investigation, it was determined the Evolv Weapon Detection System… was not designed to detect knives."" The victim is suing Evolv and the scanners were replaced by 10 metal detectors. The company has changed the front of its website many times. Initially claiming its goal was to create ""weapons-free zones"", the website now says its mission is to create ""safer experiences"". Last year, the company said it regretted any confusion around the capabilities of its technology. ""We wholeheartedly believe in our technology and our mission and deeply regret if any of our past statements confused or appeared to generalise our capabilities at the time,"" it said. But questions remain as to what Evolv has previously told customers its technology is capable of and the testing it has gone through.",2024-03-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68547574,tech
55,MEPs approve world's first comprehensive AI law,"The European Parliament has approved the world's first comprehensive framework for constraining the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). The sector has seen explosive growth - driving huge profits but also stoking fears about bias, privacy and even the future of humanity . The AI Act works by classifying products according to risk and adjusting scrutiny accordingly. The law's creators said it would make the tech more ""human-centric."" ""The AI act is not the end of the journey but the starting point for new governance built around technology,"" MEP Dragos Tudorache added. It also places the EU at the forefront of global attempts to address the dangers associated with AI. China already has introduced a patchwork of AI laws. In October 2023, US President Joe Biden announced an executive orde r requiring AI developers to share data with the government. But the EU has now gone further. ""The adoption of the AI Act marks the beginning of a new AI era and its importance cannot be overstated,"" said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester. ""The EU AI Act is the world's first and only set of binding requirements to mitigate AI risks,"" she added. She said it would make the EU the ""de facto"" global standard for trustworthy AI, leaving every other region, including the UK, to ""play catch-up."" In November 2023, the UK hosted an AI safety summit but is not planning legislation along the lines of the AI Act. The main idea of the law is to regulate AI based on its capacity to cause harm to society. The higher the risk, the stricter the rules. AI applications that pose a ""clear risk to fundamental rights"" will be banned, for example some of those that involve the processing of biometric data. AI systems considered ""high-risk"", such as those used in critical infrastructure, education, healthcare, law enforcement, border management or elections, will have to comply with strict requirements. Low-risk services, such as spam filters, will face the lightest regulation - the EU expects most services to fall into this category. The Act also creates provisions to tackle risks posed by the systems underpinning generative AI tools and chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. These would require producers of some so-called general-purpose AI systems, that can be harnessed for a range of tasks, to be transparent about the material used to train their models and to comply with EU copyright law. Mr Turodache told reporters ahead of the vote that copyright provisions had been one of the ""heaviest lobbied"" parts of the bill. OpenAI, Stability AI and graphics chip giant Nvidia are among a handful of AI firms facing lawsuits over their use of data to train generative models. Some artists, writers and musicians have argued the process of ""scraping"" huge volumes of data, including potentially their own works, from virtually all corners of the internet violates copyright laws. The Act still has to pass several more steps before it formally becomes law. Lawyer-linguists, whose job is to check and translate laws, will scour its text and the European Council - composed of representatives of EU member states - will also need to endorse it, though that is expected to be a formality. In the meantime, businesses will be working out how to comply with the legislation. Kirsten Rulf - a former advisor to the German government, and now a partner at Boston Consulting Group - says more than 300 firms have been in touch with her company so far. ""They want to know how to scale the tech, and get value from AI,"" she told the BBC. ""Businesses need and want the legal certainty.""",2024-03-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68546450,tech
56,Sail-powered cargo ship 'shows potential of wind',"Retrofitting giant, rigid sails to a cargo ship has effectively cut its fuel use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, shipping firm data shows. The Pyxis Ocean tested the British-designed WindWings for six months. Cargill says the data ""underscores the potential"" of wind to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint. Experts describe the results as ""very encouraging"", but say, at present, only a tiny volume of the international shipping fleet is using the technology. Sails have powered boats for millennia - but the type of sails trialled on the Pyxis Ocean are different to those normally seen on wind-powered vessels. Made of the same material as wind turbine blades, they are folded down in port then opened out to stand at 123ft (37.5m) on the open seas. After having the wings fitted in Shanghai, the ship set sail in August 2023. Cargill says the ship spent half a year sailing the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the North and South Atlantic, during which time it used on average three tonnes less fuel each day. That equates to 11.2 tonnes of C02 emissions saved for each day the sails were up. If replicated over a year, it would amount to the equivalent of removing 480 cars from the roads, Cargill calculates. The saving, though, is a drop in the ocean for the industry as a whole. International shipping is estimated to be responsible for 837 million tonnes of CO2 annually - or 2.1% of total global emissions. Nonetheless, Cargill says it is encouraged by the results. ""We believe technologies that harness the wind could be an important, cost-effective way to achieve our decarbonisation goals in the short, medium and long-term,"" said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill's Ocean Transportation business. The company says it is ""engaging"" with more than 250 ports worldwide to find ways for ships fitted with the sails to berth. BAR Technologies, the UK firm which designed the wings, is seeking other ships to fit, and says it will use three wings rather than two in future, increasing the fuel and emissions saved. Stephen Gordon, managing director at the maritime data firm Clarksons Research, highlighted the fact that this trial had taken place with a refurbished, rather than a brand new ship. ""The option to retrofit to an existing fleet - as has been done with the Pyxis Ocean - is very helpful,"" he told the BBC. ""It will take decades to deliver all the new ships needed for the decarbonisation journey. Even today shipyards globally are full and lead times for delivery are averaging 3.5 years."" Mr Gordon said other firms were exploring alternative energy-saving technologies, such as flettner rotors - a system of spinning cylinders first conceived 100 years ago and now enjoying a limited renaissance . But he stressed that the international shipping fleet and newbuild order-book stood at 114,000 vessels - and his company only had records of 100 of them having wind-assisted technology. Dr Simon Bullock, from the University of Manchester's Tyndall Centre, said it was time for that that to change. He said the results showed the ""major and immediate benefits of wind-assist technologies"" and urged other shipping companies to take note. ""To tackle climate change, the shipping industry needs to cut its use of fossil fuel rapidly. ""These essential technologies make major inroads into that challenge, and should be deployed and retrofitted as standard,"" he told the BBC.",2024-03-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68543677,tech
57,Reddit aims for $6.4bn valuation ahead of initial public offering,"Reddit, one of the most popular websites in the world, is hoping for a valuation of up to $6.4bn (£5bn) when its shares go public next week. The social media company, which has never made a profit, will float shares on the New York Stock Exchange. A filing in the US revealed that Reddit and its investors are hoping to sell 22 million shares for between $31 and $34 each. However, many users worry the move will fundamentally change the website. Some shares will be specially reserved for some Reddit users and moderators. The company is planning an initial public offering (IPO) which would make some of its shares publicly available to buy for the first time. ""Our users have a deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit,"" wrote co-founder Steve Huffman in a letter to prospective investors released a few weeks ago. ""We want this sense of ownership to be reflected in real ownership - for our users to be our owners. Becoming a public company makes this possible."" Reddit, which was founded almost 20 years ago, is an online forum where users can post questions and comment on topics that interest them. The company makes most of its money through advertising on the platform, although it recently struck a deal with Google which allows the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. Reddit has recorded losses every year since its start, including more than $90m last year. The valuation is also far less than the $10bn at which it was valued in a private fundraising round in 2021. Currently, the biggest shareholders include media company Advance Magazine Publishers, Chinese tech firm Tencent, US investment firm Fidelity, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT makers OpenAI. Reddit, founded in 2005, has a different feel compared with other social media companies such as Facebook or TikTok. Users often feel freer to write what they like, although subreddits are policed by moderators. The power of Reddit communities has been seen through examples such as the Gamestop saga in 2021, where users mobilised to drive up the share price of the US video game retailer. Shares which were initially worth $20 shot up to a peak of $350 after co-ordination from Redditors. However, some users are worried that the IPO would change the site for the worse. ""When the most important customers shift from [users] to shareholders, the product always [suffers],"" said one person. ""It becomes 'what can we do this quarter to squeak out an additional point of revenue', instead of 'how can we make this product better'.""",2024-03-11,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68535381,tech
58,How to spot a manipulated image,"Amid allegations that an official photograph of the Princess of Wales had been ""manipulated"", here are some clues that can help you identify if an image has been altered or faked. In a world where pictures can be digitally altered with just a few clicks or even generated entirely from scratch by artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming ever harder to trust what our eyes see. The techniques used to manipulate images are so sophisticated that we have entered the era of the hyper-realistic fake. Such images can lead to the spread of misinformation and could even influence public opinion in important events such as elections . With a picture of the Princess of Wales and her children being withdrawn by news agencies amid concerns it had been ""manipulated "", the issue has been thrown into the spotlight like never before. The Princess of Wales later apologised for making the changes to the image, stating that ""like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing"". ( Learn more about how Kate's photo may have been altered in this analysis from BBC Verify . ) But is there anything we can do to spot an image that might have been altered or AI generated? Abnormal lighting is often a giveaway that a photograph has been altered. Check the points of light in people's eyes , for example; the source of light will often be reflected in their eyes. If the size and colour don't match with the location, or if they look different between the eyes, then you might have cause to be suspicious. The way subjects and objects appear in reflective surfaces in an image can also provide clues. Shadows of objects in the image may not line up if it has been pieced together from multiple pictures, although bear in mind that some pictures can be taken with multiple lighting sources. It's worth looking at the way light plays across a subject's face. If the Sun is behind them, for example, their ears might look red. Artificial intelligence can also produce incongruent lighting and shadows, but as algorithms improve, AI-generated faces are often perceived as being more real than human faces . Another tell-tale approach is to look for features that are hard to replicate. AI is currently poor at rendering hands and ears , mangling their shapes, proportions and even the number of fingers. These are the same features that often trouble artists, but as other aspects of AI-generated images of people become hyper-real, these inaccuracies create an uncanny valley that looks unnatural to our eyes. You might also like: Look out for unusual or unnatural positioning of limbs or clothing in an image, which can be a sign that a portion of it has been copied or manipulated in some way. But also remember that the flattening of the three dimensional world into a two dimensional image can make things look a little out of place at times too. One test to apply is to look at other elements of the image in the same field of focus and position. Do they look blurry compared to other features nearby in the same depth in the photograph , or are they being ruffled by a breeze in the same way? Hidden within the code of digital images are nuggets of information that can help to pinpoint a fake. Every time a digital camera snaps an image, metadata is written into the image file. Timestamps, for example, led to questions about whether President Donald Trump was in fact at work in the White House the day after revealing he had caught Covid-19 in October 2020. Every digital camera sensor features tiny manufacturing faults that lead to unique errors that leave a kind of ""fingerprint"" on pictures . This is then associated with a specific camera and can help to identify areas of a photograph that have been manipulated . The grain of an AI-generated image can also look peculiar . Internet companies such as Google have launched image verification tools that can help people to spot AI-generated images. Facebook and Instagram have started labelling AI-generated images that come from Meta's own systems and is planning to do the same for pictures generated by other companies' AI tools . -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

59,Apple 'like The Godfather' with new App Store rules,"This week Apple made the long-awaited landmark move to allow other companies to launch app stores on iPhones. The tech giant was forced to act by EU politicians concerned about it having a market monopoly. The decision is being watched closely around the world and was initially celebrated as an industry victory for businesses and consumers in the EU. But Apple's strict new rules and fees are being heavily criticised, with Spotify calling them ""extortion"". It is one of many companies, including Fortnite maker Epic Games, that has been pushing Apple to allow alternative app stores on iPhones. The EU lawmakers hoped their rule change would encourage smaller challengers to enter the lucrative iPhone market. ""Apple says it's opening up, but it still has a tight fist around iPhones"", says Colton Adamski, a former hacker and businessman who lives near Chicago and is trying to launch one of the first alternative app shops in the EU. The 22-year-old has been running an unofficial iPhone app store for more than six years. It is, in his words, a ""grey business"" operating on the fringes of what is legal. For everywhere other than the EU, starting an app store is against Apple's terms, and installing apps outside the official App Store is prohibited. The process, known as side-loading, is common practice on Android phones, but Apple has forbidden it since launching the iPhone, arguing it is a security risk. Apps need to be verified through the official App Store, the tech giant has long said. Apple charges an average 30% commission to apps using its store, which it says is for the protection of consumers. Although the fee is controversial, it is true that generally Apple is more successful at keeping malicious apps out than other marketplaces like Google's Play Store. Colton's app shop has attracted hundreds of thousands of downloads of unofficial apps and games. The BBC tried his service and was able to download apps to an iPhone through a simple workaround that changes the phone settings to override security warnings. He has made a decent living operating his under-the-radar app shop, but has long wished to make one legitimately. So when the EU's new laws were announced in January, he jumped at the chance. ""It was so exciting we finally had the opportunity to go from a 'grey' store operating in the margins of what's allowed to finally launching a legit store,"" he says. Apple is now the biggest smartphone seller globally and has the most affluent user base, so getting his store on to iPhones would be a major win. Colton's excitement diminished though when he and his team started reading Apple's terms and conditions. He compares Apple's rules to a gangster from The Godfather or Sopranos. Yes, you can open your shop on their turf, but you have to do exactly as they say or they will shut you down. Apple insists that new app shops have €1m (£851,000) in the bank, but if their reserves dip below that figure, they can be closed down. Apple did not respond to our questions about why this is needed, but has previously said it is about weeding out dodgy, or scam, stores. In the last few weeks, since Colton secured his line of credit, Apple has said that app developers of ""good standing"" for at least two years can also build an app shop without the €1m. Colton's next hurdle to overcome is how to make a profit. Apple automatically bills new app stores half a euro for every download after one million. Apple says this Core Technology Fee is about keeping iPhones safe through security updates. But Colton feels this is like a so-called protection fee paid to a mob under the guise of making sure a shop owner's business is safe. So if someone downloads his app shop app but never uses it, he still has to pay Apple 50 cents. Apple is also applying the 50 cent fee to individual apps that receive more than a million downloads, which is worrying some popular app makers. The company has created a website where app developers can estimate how much money they would owe Apple if they choose to list their apps on other stores. It could total thousands if the million download figure is passed, but if they sold exclusively through Apple's App Store it would cost nothing. Another charge being criticised is the 17% fee Apple will charge on any sales of an app sold on its App Store and elsewhere. Apple argues that 99% of apps it currently hosts are small enough that they can reduce or maintain their current fees. ""Ultimately, we want developers to have the flexibility to choose the business terms that make the most sense for them,"" a spokeswoman said. But, according to Colton, just like The Godfather, Apple is making companies an offer they cannot refuse to keep them listing only on the App Store. ""Many app developers I know are angry and upset. How on earth can they explain this Core Technology Fee? We don't see Android pulling that nonsense,"" Colton says. Android phones, running Google software, have historically been more open, allowing other app shops to exist like Samsung Galaxy Store and Huawei AppGallery. But Google's own app shop - Google Play - is by far the most dominant player and, like Apple's App Store, charges apps on average 30% of their profits or subscriptions as commission. EU lawmakers who created the Digital Markets Act have not yet given an opinion on Apple's alternative app store rules, and say they will assess them once they are seen in practice. For now, Colton says he is determined to make his app store work. ""It's proving to be really tough but me and my team are working hard because this is literally the future of iPhones,"" he said.",2024-03-10,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68517246,tech
60,Craig Phillips: TV star shaken after Jaguar brakes fail during drive,"Craig Phillips, former winner of the reality TV show Big Brother, has described his fear when the brakes failed on his Jaguar I-Pace electric vehicle while he was driving. It is the second report of the brakes failing on this particular model while in motion. Mr Phillips said it was ""terrifying"" to feel ""out of control"" of the vehicle while his family were also inside. Jaguar said it was investigating and took both claims seriously. Earlier this week , another I-Pace driver claimed to have found himself unable to brake on a motorway as the car accelerated and had to be flanked by police. ""Following the incident involving a Jaguar I-Pace on the M62 on the afternoon of 6th March, we are looking into this matter with urgency,"" Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said. ""A full review is underway to determine the cause of this incident, which is still yet to be established. The safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority."" It said it was also taking Mr Phillips' claims seriously. Mr Phillips' experience, first reported by the Daily Mail, happened on New Year's Eve 2023. He told BBC News: ""In the afternoon, I'd set off from home with my wife and kids in the back of the car. I'd barely gone a mile from home and as I came to traffic lights, travelling at about 30mph, three cars away from the lights I could not brake. ""I was pushing on the pedal, but the hydraulic felt like it was pushing my foot up. My whole body was locked up trying to push down on the brake."" He said fortunately the lights then changed from red as he could not have physically stopped. ""I immediately returned home really slowly. I didn't want to go above 10 to 15mph. I would not want anyone else to be in the same situation, particularly with children in the back."" He had owned the car for more than three years and has now returned it. He called for a full recall of the model by Jaguar as a safety precaution. A Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said: ""We are taking these recent claims by Mr Phillips very seriously and are looking into his complaint. In addition we are concerned to hear that Mr Phillips may not have received the high levels of care to which we hold ourselves accountable. ""Our client experience as well as the safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority."" Like many electric vehicles, the Jaguar I-Pace offers regenerative braking, in which the energy created as the car brakes is re-captured and sent back to the battery. Thousands of the cars have been sold in the UK since 2018, which cost nearly £70,000. In 2019, some Jaguar I-Pace vehicles were recalled in North America because of a fault with the system. Jaguar was already due to end production of the I-Pace, which was its first electric car, next year.",2024-03-08,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68514718,tech
61,Production of Duvel beer hit by cyber-attack,"Production at four breweries owned by Belgian beer firm Duvel has ground to a halt after a cyber-attack. The company says it fell victim to the suspected ransomware attack ""during the night from Tuesday to Wednesday."" Initially, five of its production facilities were shut down - one has since come back online. Duvel said it was currently unable to give further details ""as the investigation into the cause of the cyber-attack is ongoing."" ""The built-in command systems and alarms in the IT-system worked well, so our IT department was immediately informed of the attack,"" the company said in a statement. ""The servers were immediately shut down, which also shut down production at the four Belgian production sites and the production site in Kansas City."" Duvel said that one plant, in Puurs-Sint-Amands in Belgium, was now back up and running, but production at the other four was still halted. Duvel, which also produces beers such as Chouffe, Vedett and Liefmans, was founded in 1871 and made €583m (£497m) in revenue in 2022. That year it produced around 230 million litres of beer. It is not yet known whether the supply of its products will be affected by this incident. The company told local media that it was a ransomware attack.

62,Bafta Games Awards 2024: Baldur's Gate 3 and Spider-Man lead nods,"Baldur's Gate 3 leads the way in this year's Bafta Games Awards nominations with a total of 10. As well as being in the running for best game, the actors behind popular characters Karlach and Astarion are among those up for solo awards. Sony's hit sequel Spider-Man 2 received nine nods, closely followed by Alan Wake 2, with eight. Elsewhere, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor have six nominations each. This year will be the twentieth anniversary of the awards - one of the most prestigious nights in the calendar for the gaming industry - and will be held on 11 April 2024. Last year gaming sales topped £4.7bn in the UK , more than double that of the music industry, according to the digital entertainment and retail association (ERA). Samantha Béart, nominated for her performance as Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, said it felt ""absolutely incredible"" to be up for the Performer in a Leading Role award. ""It's great to be noticed, and this year there were so many great performances,"" she said. ""What an achievement, and with so many of us in the category as well - I'm so chuffed for everyone. ""Of those that didn't make it - I will avenge them all!"" Both Baldur's Gate and Zelda were smash hits with critics, and rank among the 30 highest-rated games of all time, according to review aggregator Metacritic . They will compete in the Best Game category alongside Spider-Man 2, with Alan Wake 2, Super Mario Bros Wonder and surprise hit Dave the Diver making up the games in the running for the top award. ""It's likely that 2023 will go down in history as one of the best years for new video game releases,"" said Bafta Games committee head Tara Saunders. ""There was a steady stream of new, creative, imaginative work that's been pouring out of some of the best and brightest developers in the business. ""I don't know what was in the air, but there is some magic in there."" The shortlist was narrowed down from a longlist of 60 games , which was announced in December. The awards are decided by specially selected juries, but in a change from previous years, the Best Game and Best British Game awards are voted on by more than 1,200 Bafta members - professionals with years of experience in gaming. They will have the difficult task of choosing the winners in a year which saw gamers spoiled for choice. 2023's surprise hit Baldur's Gate 3, based on Dungeons and Dragons, has already won the top award at the 2023 Game Awards . As well as Best Game it has been nominated in the Music and Artistic Achievement categories at the Bafta Games Awards, and five of its performers are up for individual golden masks. ""We're thrilled for the entire team that helped bring Baldur's Gate 3 to life, and the prestigious recognition that comes with these eight category nominations,"" the game's director Swen Vincke told the BBC. ""It's a hugely motivating force helping us to move forward with even greater enthusiasm."" Meanwhile, both Nintendo and Sony have had games nominated that broke sales records in 2023 - with Tears of the Kingdom shipping 10m units in three days , and Spider-Man 2 becoming the fastest-selling game made by PlayStation . Spider-Man has three voice actors up for individual awards, while it is also nominated in the Game Design and Technical Achievement categories. It will compete with Zelda in those two categories, while Nintendo's game also has nominations for the Music and Audio Achievement awards. The battle for Best Game may come down to Baldur's Gate, Zelda and Spider-Man, but Bafta has been known to throw up a surprise or two before - with last year's awards being no exception. In 2023, the gong was taken by indie game Vampire Survivors, while mystery title What Remains of Edith Finch won in 2018. That means the developers of Dave the Diver might have reason to be hopeful their unexpected fishing and sushi-restaurant-managing hit could take home the big prize. Meanwhile, studios across the length of the UK make up the nominees for the Best British Game category, with Brighton-based Bytten Studio nominated for Cassette Beasts, and Scottish studio Sad Owl nominated for Viewfinder. And Football Manager 2024 is also up for an award in the category following the release of the 20th game in the best-selling series . ""It's really inspiring to see that in the Game Design, Debut Game and the Game Beyond Entertainment categories there is a strong presence of indie game titles, such as Tchia, Cocoon and Venba,"" said UK publisher No More Robots production director Sophie Smart. ""It really shows that despite the difficulties in the industry right now with layoffs, there is still a deep appreciation for games made by all sorts of teams and it's great to see Bafta recognising that."" Elsewhere, Nadji Jeter and Yuri Lowenthal and have received nods for their performances as Miles Morales and Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2. While Amelia Tyler, Neil Newborn, Samantha Béart, Andrew Wincott and Tracy Wiles are the five nominated for their performances in Baldur's Gate 3. ""What's interesting about the performance categories is you see established actors like Ralph Ineson (Cid in Final Fantasy XVI) and Tony Todd (Venom in Spider-Man 2) and then you've got newcomers in there,"" said Bafta's executive director of awards and content Emma Baehr. ""11 of the 12 are first-time nominees - we're showcasing and celebrating them for the first time."" But despite featuring on Bafta's longlist in December, Idris Elba has missed out for his work as Solomon Reed in Cyberpunk 2077.",2024-03-07,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68478486,tech
63,Pornhub challenges EU over online content rules,"One of the world's most popular pornography websites, Pornhub, is contesting new EU rules. The adult site is facing new obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), including strict requirements on age verification. The new rules apply to what the EU designates a Very large Online Platform (VLOP) - which Pornhub says it is not. ""We believe the European Commission erred in its calculation of our user numbers"", the firm said. The challenge was filed to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg on March 1 for Pornhub by its owner, the Canada-based Aylo. Technius, the parent firm of another adult site, Stripchat, has also registered a case, as has WebGroup Czech Republic, which operates XVideos. To be designated a VLOP, a site needs to be visited by more than 45 million Europeans on average every month - a threshold the EU says Pornhub meets. ""The Commission stands fully behind its calculations of the user numbers of Pornhub and Stripchat,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. But Aylo says as of January 31, 2024, Pornhub had 32 million monthly active users - so it is filing an application to have its VLOP status annulled. It said it looked forward to the facts ""being fully and fairly aired"" in court. The DSA aims to give people in the EU greater protections online, with VLOPs facing what the European Commission calls more ""diligent content moderation."" Among its measures are new responsibilities to take down illegal content, such as non-consensual videos. Sites can also be asked to have a publicly accessible database of advertisements - a requirement Aylo says it considers ""illegal"". The platforms are expected to give detailed plans by April 20 about how they limit major risks like violence against women and protection of minors. Breaching the new law can lead to fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover. The websites' owners had until this month to contest the decisions. The DSA is not only the piece of European legislation causing tech companies headaches. From Thursday, six big firms - designated ""gatekeepers"" by the EU - face new responsibilities under the Digitial Markets Act (DMA). But one of them, Apple, has already run into controversy. It has barred Fortnite-maker, Epic Games, from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe. One of the DMA's objectives is to open up big tech app stores to more competition. The EU says it will now question Apple about its decision.",2024-03-07,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68500945,tech
64,Police worried 101 call bot would struggle with 'Brummie' accents,"West Midlands Police trialled a voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in a bid to deal with rising volumes of non-emergency calls. Sensitive technical details of the plan were erroneously published online in a document seen by the BBC. It set out potential risks of the AI, including whether the system, dubbed ""Amy101"", would understand local ""Brummie"" accents. West Midlands Police has insisted ""robust safeguards"" were in place. Based on the tech behind Amazon's popular voice assistant, Alexa, the trial explored how AI could help the force cope with increasing volumes of calls, and potentially offer new services such as responses in different languages. A document detailing the plan was mistakenly posted online by the office of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC). The document, marked ""official sensitive"" and with warnings that it was ""not to be publicly disclosed"", has since been removed. Amy101 was designed to speak or text-chat in order to deal with callers' inquiries and was expected to handle about 200 calls per day. The project, a two month proof-of-concept trial, was nationally funded. It was - the document suggested - the first such project where an AI-powered tool would speak to callers, though other forces were also exploring uses of the tech. Amy101 had the ability to prioritise vulnerable callers, by looking out for certain keywords - such as those referencing domestic violence - and ensuring they were next-in-line to be dealt with by a human call operator, the document says. Through speech or text chat it could direct calls, provide advice on issues such as reporting criminal damage, or requesting a crime update. West Midlands Police told the BBC the trial began on 19 December 2023 and had now concluded. Its director of commercial services, Peter Gillett, said - by the time the trial started - the force had already improved and was now ""one of the top-performing police forces for managing emergency and non-emergency calls"". The document - prepared for an ethical oversight committee that advises the PCC and Chief Constable - reveals the potential problems that might arise with Amy101, including whether the tech could cope with the local accent. ""Bias will naturally occur within the ""Amy"" system based on accents/localisation - for example can she understand ""Brummie"" accents? And are they treated with equal weighting to different accents in English?"" the document asks. Because Alexa is used globally - coping with a range of accents and languages - it was hoped that this type of bias had been removed. And if calls were not understood they would be transferred to the queue for a human operator. Mr Gillett said the force recognised that technologies capable of understanding ordinary language were ""not flawless"", and therefore may struggle with accents. As a result the force used a ""large-scale"" system ""to mitigate this bias"". Potential issues around safeguarding data were also flagged, including the risk calls would be used to help train the Amazon AI system, called Lex V2, behind Amy101. Some calls could include personally identifiable information. The document provides the example, ""My name is Marc and I want to report my house was broken into….."". The police can, however, opt-out of this kind of training and will do this ""where viable"", the document says. The ethics committee also had a number of questions, recorded in its minutes , about Amy101, such as the voice and ""gendered name"" of the tool. The force responded arguing ""humanisation"" was needed. It also suggested officers requested further analysis from Amazon on potential issues ""such as regional accent recognition and bias testing"". It is not clear whether the concerns raised in the document ever materialised, though police struck a positive note about the outcome of the trial: ""AI (Artificial Intelligence) does present some potential opportunities for providing a more efficient and robust service"", Mr Gillett said. Now the ""proof-of-concept"" trial is over, the force would be ""sharing the results and outcomes at a national scale"", he added. According to the document the government was also interested in the trial - it said a Home Office team was ""keeping a close eye"" on it with a view to wider uses.",2024-03-07,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68466369,tech
65,Methane: the tricky hunt for hidden emissions,"A new satellite will measure global methane emissions, but why does agriculture's contribution remain so elusive? The team behind the world's most advanced methane-monitoring satellite, MethaneSat , are keen on metaphors about cleaning. ""About the size of a washing machine,"" was how environmental scientist Steven Wofsy, described the orbiting object at a press conference ahead of its launch. ""Like a push-broom,"" was his phrase for its capacity to scan the surface of the Earth. The metaphors are apt. Methane is a particularly dirty greenhouse gas, driving about 30% of the heating the planet has experienced so far. It breaks down in the atmosphere in just 12 years, which is much sooner than the centuries taken by CO2 – but it is also around 80 times more powerful over a 20-year time span. With 60% of global methane emissions coming from human activities, reductions are essential to reaching the world's climate change targets . Equally, if not addressed in a timely way, it could contribute to the passing of dangerous tipping points that lead to rapid and irreversible change around the globe. MethaneSat aims to help by providing an independent source of methane monitoring, with a primary focus on methane leaked from oil and gas fields – such as the recent, months-long mega leak in Kazakhstan , which resulted in the release of 127,000 tonnes of the potent gas. By supplementing existing satellite data with even more precise measurements, MethaneSat hopes to provide a near-comprehensive view of global leaks. Yet the oil and gas industry is also far from the only source of human-caused methane emissions. Agriculture is in fact the largest human source of methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, at almost 40%. Energy is in second at around 37% , and waste in third. Within agriculture, flooded rice fields account for 8% of total human-linked emissions, but belches and manure from livestock are the biggest contributors, with cattle the biggest single offenders. In California, the non-profit coalition Climate Trace found that one single cattle feedlot produced more methane than the state's biggest oil and gas fields. ""If we don't reduce emissions from the food system we won't meet the 1.5C target,"" sums up Mario Herrero, a professor of sustainable food systems at Cornell University in New York, who oversaw the methane calculations used in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. ""Animal numbers are increasing like crazy , thus methane is increasing. We have to reduce emissions from livestock."" So why is farming's methane taking the back-seat in terms of global attention? And what can be done to address this climate-action blindspot? The rationale for focussing on oil and gas activities is that easy wins should be tackled first. ""If you're looking to have the biggest impact and make the biggest difference, it's reasonable to focus on oil and gas first,"" according to Mark Brownstein, a senior vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the environmental non-profit funding MethaneSat and working in partnership with Google on the project. ""There's fewer actors involved than in agriculture,"" he told reporters. And ""there's also the resources there to solve it"". Conversely, agriculture's methane output is more elusive. Aerial remote sensing measurements, such as those taken from aircraft or drones, can capture methane leaks, says Aaron Davitt, principal analyst on remote sensing for the non-profit WattTime , but these technologies can only be deployed in limited regions for limited amounts of time. Plus, even knowing where to direct remote sensors or satellites to look in the first place can be fraught, adds Sam Schiller, chief executive of Carbon Yield , a firm that helps farmers adapt to climate change. ""In most parts of the world, public datasets of livestock facilities are hard to come by."" So can more precise satellites help? ""In the last five years, satellites have revolutionised our knowledge and understanding of methane emissions for the better,"" says Antoine Halff, chief analyst and co-founder at Kayrros , an environmental intelligence company. ""Thanks to satellites, we can not only track the large emissions events known as 'super-emitters' with great accuracy, but also measure overall emissions at the basin or country level. Importantly, we can do so in a way that is completely independent and verifiable."" According to Sara Mikaloff-Fletcher, a biogeochemical scientist at National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, who is leading MethaneSat's agricultural research, that capacity will only increase in relation to agriculture too. The new satellite's ability to map methane at a precision of 2 ppb (parts per billion) means it will be the first satellite well suited to measuring agricultural emissions, she says. ""That number might not mean a lot to your readers, but to me it is the same precision I could get from an instrument on the ground – which is extraordinary."" There are still technical limitations, however. In terms of methane from livestock, small groups of animals pose problems for satellite monitoring, as do farms in places where agriculture is not the primary emissions source. ""I'm also not sure how well we will be able to do sheep, which have smaller emissions than cows,"" Mikaloff-Fletcher adds.  On rice production, meanwhile, satellites cannot see through cloud and nearby wetlands can complicate the data: ""It is going to be more challenging,"" she says. There are also limitations as a result of policy. A Global Methane Pledge to reduce emissions by at least 30% by 2030, agreed at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, does not include an agriculture target. The agreement only talks about providing farmers with ""incentives and partnerships"", rather focusing on ""all feasible reductions"" that the energy industry is tasked with, says Nusa Urbanic, chief executive at Changing Markets Foundation , a campaign organisation. This reluctance to confront agriculture's emissions problem can be seen at a national level too. The US has a provision that exempts farmers from giving detailed emissions accounts. The EU recently removed a target for agricultural methane from its new 2040 climate goal. Why the reluctance? According to Halff, while fossil fuel companies are ""treated as certified carbon villains"", there is a ""different aura around farming"" where small family farms can sit alongside larger, corporate operations. There are some positive moves from industry to tackle the problem. A Dairy Methane Action Alliance has seen six of the world's largest dairy companies sign up to reducing their output, says Marcelo Mena, the former environment minister of Chile and now chief executive of the philanthropic Global Methane Hub. The meat sector, however, ""has not shown the same level of commitment, and needs to do a lot more"". The key to further progress, Herrero emphasises, is ""less but better"" production of livestock. Methane from enteric fermentation – especially cow burps – is tricky to solve, but new breeding and feeding techniques could help. (Read more about how New Zealand is reducing methane emissions from farming .) Experiments with red algae in dairy-cow's feed suggest it may achieve reductions in methane, Herrero says. Meanwhile, in Japan, over 35% of food waste is recycled as pig feed, helping create a more circular food economy. But human diets may still be the ultimate blind spot holding up methane reduction. Of various measures that the EU could adopt to reach the UN Environment Programme's recommendation of a 40-45% reduction of global methane by 2030, a Changing Markets report found that 50% of consumers would need to eat less meat and dairy . You might also like: More information on the extent of agriculture's methane problem could help shift this reluctance, for politicians and consumers alike. And here, once again, more independent monitoring and reporting will be key, says Herrero. Not just satellites are needed, he says, but methane sensors in individual barns. Plus a global methane observatory to coordinate the data. If contributing to the latter was part of the Paris Agreement and nations' individual pledges on climate action, it could help ""ensure continuous monitoring"". Ultimately though, Herrero reflects, ""we can't wait to have the perfect monitoring system to act on methane.

66,ChatGPT-maker OpenAI hits back at Elon Musk criticism,"OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, have responded to a lawsuit by Elon Musk by making counter-accusations against him. Mr Musk is suing the company he helped found, alleging it has abandoned its original mission of helping humanity. He says it is focusing on generating profits for partner and major investor Microsoft instead. But OpenAI says Mr Musk previously backed the idea of a for-profit structure and even suggested a merger with his car firm Tesla. In a blog post on its website, OpenAI also claims Mr Musk at one point wanted ""absolute control"" of the company, before eventually leaving it in 2018. It says it intends to move to dismiss claims in Mr Musk's recently filed lawsuit . OpenAI also published a trove of Mr Musk's emails to his fellow co-founders to dispute some of his claims. BBC News has approached Mr Musk for comment. But he has already responded to the blog post on X, formerly Twitter. ""Change your name,"" he wrote . Mr Musk's lawsuit, filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday 29 February, claimed that OpenAI breached principles he agreed to when helping co-found the company in 2015. It also took aim at Microsoft. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the AI firm since it established a for-profit arm in 2019, which allowed it to raise money. His lawyers argued in court filings the firm had since become a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world"". ""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired - someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him,"" OpenAI said in its blog. It was written by fellow co-founders and executives including chief executive Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Mr Musk's lawsuit had targeted both Mr Altman and Mr Brockman, alongside the firm itself. The blog goes into detail to dispute a number of claims made in the lawsuit. It says that in early 2018 Mr Musk had forwarded an email saying OpenAI should join up with his electric car company, Tesla, to use it as its ""cash cow"". ""As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control,"" the blog post adds.",2024-03-06,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68488230,tech
67,"Bitcoin price briefly tops $69,000 for new all-time high","The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, briefly hit a new all-time high of more than $69,000. It surpassed the previous record set in November 2021 - though by 2022 Bitcoin's value had sunk to $16,500. The new surge in price has been spurred by US finance giants pouring billions into buying bitcoins. The cryptocurrency rose to around $69,200 shortly after 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, before falling back. It was trading around $62,185 by 21:00 GMT. Bitcoin's value has spiked by more than 50% over the last month, according to cryptocurrency market data platform CoinMarketCap. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said its price could go higher than its new record but warned that crypto was ""notoriously volatile."" ""Too often in the past the price crash was timed so that ordinary investors buying Bitcoin during the bubble are the ones who lose out,"" she told the BBC. The new record represents another dramatic moment in Bitcoin's turbulent history. It was invented in 2009 by a person or persons calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto - their true identity remains a mystery. Conceived as a means to create money for the internet, its roots lay in an anti-establishment ethos encouraging people to live free from the existing power structure of financial institutions and governments. However, its new all-time high value has come about precisely because those establishment firms have been pouring billions of dollars into acquiring it. That has been made possible because, in January 2024, US regulators reluctantly approved several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). That allowed giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Between them, they have been buying hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, rapidly driving up their value. Prof Alexander told the BBC these entrants ""are attracting institutional investors into Bitcoin and they are putting a considerable upwards pressure on price."" But she added Bitcoin's ""halving"" event, expected to take place in April, may also influence the cryptocurrency's value. ""In the past, these events have been accompanied by price surges,"" she said. For many holders of Bitcoin, this will be a moment to celebrate - as their own wealth will have risen a great deal. But history suggests they should be prepared for that to change. Bitcoin's value tumbled to 18-month lows of nearly $20,000 in June 2022 as investors sought to cut ties with riskier investments amid a gloomy global economic outlook. The cryptocurrency's price slumped further later that year when FTX - the huge cryptocurrency exchange founded by so-called ""king of crypto"" Sam Bankman-Fried - collapsed into bankruptcy in November 2022. Its peaks and troughs continued throughout 2023, but it managed to climb back up to trade above $40,000 towards the end of the year. It is not just companies and individual investors who have been tracking those fluctuations closely. In Central America, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele has embraced the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin-loving leader has spent more than $100m of his developing nation's public money on buying almost 3000 bitcoins over the last few years. His investment is now worth around 60% more than he paid for it. Although no public records have been released on the specifics.",2024-03-05,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68423452,tech
68,Facebook and Instagram restored after outages,"Meta says it has resolved a ""technical issue"" which caused Facebook, Messenger and Instagram to go down. Hundreds of thousands of users worldwide were unable to access them for around two hours on Tuesday. People trying to log onto the websites and apps were finding error messages and were unable to refresh their feeds as normal. Meta also apologised to those who had been affected, saying it resolved the problem as quickly as it could. Tracking website Downdetector indicated the outages had affected multiple countries. Meta's platforms are some of the most popular in the world. Facebook has three billion active monthly users, while Instagram is expected to hit 1.4 billion worldwide later this year. Threads, its rival to Twitter, that was launched in 2023, also reported outages. WhatsApp - which Meta also owns - was unaffected. The biggest outage Meta experienced was in 2021, when founder Mark Zuckerberg apologised for the disruption caused.

69,Musk attacks 'dumb eco-terrorists' over Tesla fire,"Elon Musk has said a suspected arson attack which has halted production at Tesla's Berlin car factory was ""dumb"". A far-left activist group says it targeted the site because of the amount of resources and labour it uses. The company says car-making is unlikely to resume before next week, with the outage likely to cost it ""in the high nine-digit euro range."" Tesla wants to double the size of its German factory - a plan which is opposed by some environmentalists. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk used the German phrase ""extrem dumm"" - extremely stupid - to describe the targeting of the site. ""These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals,"" he wrote. In a letter published online, activists calling themselves the Volcano Group said they sabotaged production. An electricity pylon close to the plant caught fire, causing power outages in the factory and nearby towns. Tesla said workers had been sent home but its building was in a ""safe state"". The fire did not reach the electric car-maker's factory itself but did burn an electricity pylon and high-voltage wires. In its letter claiming responsibility for the attack, the Volcano Group said it sabotaged Tesla because it ate up resources and labour. It also accused Tesla of contaminating groundwater and using huge amounts of drinking water. State police have told the BBC they are currently examining the letter. ""The rule of law will react to such an act of sabotage with the utmost severity,"" said Interior Minister for Brandenburg state Michael Stuebgen after the attack took place on Tuesday morning. Some environmentalists are unhappy with the Berlin expansion plan because it would involve chopping down nearby trees. Around 100 people are camping in a forest near the factory. However, those green activists have distanced themselves from what has happened. One group, which calls itself Robin Wood, told the BBC it had ""nothing to do with the fire"". The Tesla factory currently makes around 500,000 cars a year - the Elon Musk-owned company wants to double that. Production is not expected to restart until next week, according to plant manager Andre Thierig. He added that the outage would cost ""in the high nine-digit Euro range"" after both power lines into the plant were broken.",2024-03-05,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68479242,tech
70,Apple fined €1.8bn by EU for breaking streaming rules,"Apple has been fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) by the EU for breaking competition laws over music streaming. The firm had prevented streaming services from informing users of payment options outside the Apple app store, the European Commission said. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple abused its dominant position in the market for a decade. She ordered the US tech giant to remove all the restrictions. Apple has said it will appeal against the decision. The European Commission's decision was triggered by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify, which was unhappy about the restriction and Apple's 30% fee.. Ms Vestager said Apple had restricted ""developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem"". ""This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" she said. However, Apple said it would appeal, adding there was no evidence consumers had been harmed. ""The decision was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,"" the company said in a statement. ""The primary advocate for this decision, and the biggest beneficiary, is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. ""Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the EC [European Commission] more than 65 times during this investigation,"" it said. Spotify called the fine handed out to Apple ""an important moment"" and said it sent ""a powerful message"" that ""no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers"". Apple said the Swedish company pays no commission to them as it sells its subscriptions on its website and not on the app store. Spotify had argued that the restrictions benefit Apple's rival music streaming service, Apple Music. In January, Apple announced plans to allow EU customers to download apps outside of their own app store, as the introduction of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) drew closer. The aim of the European Union's DMA is to help competition in the technology sector and to try to break down the stronghold the likes of Apple and Google have on the market. The tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with a full list of requirements under the new legislation, or face a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover. The firms have until later this week to comply with a raft of changes announced since the start of the year, as Apple, Meta and TikTok pursue challenges to aspects of the law. Law professor at EDHEC, Anne Witt, told the BBC the DMA will have a ""significant impact"" on the way designated platforms operate within the EU. ""It is a more effective but also much blunter legal tool in the fight against market concentration in the digital economy,"" she said. Last week, Spotify and 33 other companies operating across a wide range of digital sectors wrote to the European Commission with a renewed attack on Apple's ""lack of compliance"" with the DMA. ""Apple's new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,"" it said.",2024-03-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68467752,tech
71,Nissan accused of dumping its electric car pioneers,"Owners of Nissan Leaf electric cars have accused the firm of ""dumping its pioneers"" after it announced its app would stop working for older vehicles. The firm says the app - which allows remote control of functions such as heating - is stopping because the UK's 2G network is being switched off. But customers have reacted with anger, telling the BBC they did not expect it to be withdrawn. Experts expect the issue to affect more electric vehicles as the market grows. Around 3,000 Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 cars made before 2016 are affected by the app being withdrawn. These older vehicles are fitted with 2G control units which communicate with the app. Nissan told the BBC: ""The NissanConnect EV app currently linked to Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 vehicles produced up until 2016 will shut down from 1 April 2024 in preparation of the 2G technology sunset."" It added: ""Owners will, however, still be able to use key features such as Climate Control Timer and Charging Timer directly from their car's Navigation System."" Affected drivers have told the BBC of their disappointment - in part because mobile network operators will not be phasing out 2G until the end of the decade. ""I was very surprised,"" said Max Siegieda, a 2013 Nissan Leaf owner in Manchester. ""I would have expected at least six months, 12 months, something like that to arrange alternatives. This is a key feature of the car that's going away."" He said the app's remote access for features such as heating the car or charging remotely at cheaper times was ""a major selling point"" when he bought the car second-hand in 2022. He was already considering upgrading but now says he would be ""reluctant"" to buy another Nissan ""because of the lack of notice"" they gave about the app shutdown.

""Would I buy another one again, from this manufacturer, if they're not going to support it for a long term? Not sure,"" Mr Morris said. Though this issue affects a relatively small number of drivers, experts predict many more vehicle owners will encounter similar problems in the future. Dr Benjamin Gorman, a senior lecturer at Bournemouth University, said Nissan ""really should have built in some kind of backward compatibility"" so that the car could still connect by plugging in a phone or through Bluetooth, adding that ""it is bad design."" But he said, in the future, other electric vehicle owners could also see their software eventually lose functionality as technology moved on, and companies stopped issuing updates. He also pointed to broader trends within the industry, such as some car manufacturers starting to charge a monthly subscription fee for access to extra features such as apps. ""I think it's going to be a much wider issue, because essentially, manufacturers are increasingly moving to selling hardware as a service,"" said Dr Gorman. However, Sam Sheehan, motoring editor at car firm Cinch, said it was important to keep the problem in perspective, with this case having a lot to do with the Leaf being a trailblazer. ""It was initially the only mass-market EV [electric vehicle] on sale, which means the connected software it uses is very old,"" he told the BBC. Mr Sheehan predicts that while newer cars will eventually lose some functionality as technology moves on it's likely they will ""stay working for much, much longer than the first Leaf's ancient tech.""",2024-03-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68426263,tech
72,"As banks buy up bitcoins, who else are the 'Bitcoin whales'?","The price of Bitcoin is close to its all-time high, thanks in large part to US finance giants. Investment firms like Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, are pouring billions of dollars into buying the volatile digital asset. In the last few weeks, these powerful institutions have become so called 'Bitcoin whales'. Because of Bitcoin's system there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. 19 million have been created, but many are already accounted for and probably off the market. So what other organisations or individuals are Bitcoin whales, and what does the shift in wealth mean for the digital currency that was originally created as a peer-to-peer internet money? The figures below are estimates gathered from direct research and published information, but should give a good overview of how Bitcoin is distributed. Our data collection ended on the morning of 29 February. Estimates for how many bitcoins are lost forever vary between three million to as many as six million. Bitcoins can be lost because people forget the details of their digital wallets - there is no 'customer support' in Bitcoin. Just ask James Howells, who lost 8,000 bitcoins on a discarded hard drive in Wales. Some of these lost bitcoins might also come from abandoned criminal proceeds left untouched. According to crypto-investigators at Elliptic, 3.15 million bitcoins have been dormant for 10 years or more. Some analysts - like those from investigators Chainalysis - say Bitcoin that hasn't been moved in five years could also be lost too. So millions more bitcoins could potentially be added to the lost pile. A loose estimate that's often agreed upon is 3.5 million. But 1.1 million of those dormant coins are likely to belong to the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, so we can take that portion out of the equation. A conservative estimate for lost coins therefore is about 2.4 million, or 11% of all bitcoins. Cryptocurrency exchanges act like banks for crypto-users. You can exchange your traditional money like dollars or pounds for Bitcoin and other digital tokens. K33 researchers estimate that about 2.3 million bitcoins are kept by exchanges, either on behalf of customers or as float. Binance is the world's largest exchange and is estimated to have about 550,000 bitcoins - followed by Bitfinex (403,000), Coinbase (386,000), Robinhood (146,000) and OKX (126,000). In total it is thought exchanges hold about 11% of all bitcoins. Leaving your coins on an exchange can go wrong though, for example with the collapse of FTX which left customers without access to their coins. Some Bitcoin purists are also uneasy about how a reliance on large and increasingly regulated and legally compliant exchanges goes against the anti-establishment ethos of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin whale is someone who holds more than 10,000 bitcoins in their digital wallet. The website Bitinfocharts uses public blockchain records to keep a Bitcoin Rich List of the 100 richest wallets, and there are about 80 wallets with 10,000 coins or more, whose owners are unknown. Owning one of these wallets would make you a billionaire. Some of them might be the wallets of people or organisations which appear elsewhere in this graph but we will never know, unless a researcher makes the link or the whale outs themselves. A loose estimate is that large whales account for about 8% of all bitcoins. The way that Bitcoin was invented means there can only ever be 21 million coins. Every coin has to be mined using a network of volunteer computers around the world. These computers - often owned by large Bitcoin mining companies - act like high-tech accountants checking and securing the record of Bitcoin transactions. In return for the work, the computers are automatically rewarded with Bitcoins. Over time, the amount of coins given out as part of the mining reward is automatically reduced and in April it will halve again, squeezing the supply of new coins further. There are still about 7% of coins yet to be mined, and it is estimated that the last Bitcoin will be created in 2140. The anonymous creator of Bitcoin holds an estimated 1.1 million bitcoins in wallets that were the first to be created in 2009. None of the coins have been moved in years, and no-one knows who Satoshi is - or even if he/ she/ they are still alive. If they are still alive - and estimates are correct - then this would make Satoshi Nakamoto roughly the 22nd richest person in the world. This stash is about 5% of all bitcoins. In January, US financial authorities allowed regulated investment firms to start selling new financial products linked to Bitcoin, called Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In mid-February, the investment giants that applied to start ETFs began buying bitcoins in their thousands, as everything from hedge funds to stock market traders purchased ETFs to bet on the price of Bitcoin, without having to own any coins themselves. According to K33 Research, 933,000 coins had already been allocated or purchased by 29 February, and are currently being held by the institutions for these new financial products. K33 analysts think that the biggest holder is Grayscale, which started as a digital currency investment firm. It is estimated to have around 450,000 bitcoins. Other giants include BlackRock (150,000) and Fidelity (102,000). Most crypto-fans online are celebrating the rise in their personal fortunes thanks to the financial establishment pumping up Bitcoin's value through increased demand. But some have expressed concerns about a consolidation of power and wealth into the traditional regulated banking system that Bitcoin was invented to replace. These financial giants now hold about 4.5% of all coins. One wonders what Satoshi Nakamoto will think if and when the banks overtake him/ her in their bitcoin holdings. Police forces around the world regularly bust cyber-crime gangs or illicit market places, seizing huge stashes of bitcoins in the process. There have been three major seizures of Bitcoin by the US since 2020. Eventually they will be sold at auction, but according to research from 21.co the funds have remained in their respective crypto-wallets and not moved, so there are nearly 200,000 bitcoins held from the busts. Arkham Intelligence has also linked a Bitcoin wallet address containing another 30,000 coins to the US takedown of the darknet market place Silk Road. The UK is thought to hold 61,000 bitcoins from a major seizure in 2018, and it is thought German police still have 50,000 coins from a recent operation . Bitcoin believers are often depicted as having laser eyes in images on social media, and none burn brighter than those of software entrepreneur Michael Saylor. In 2020, he persuaded his enterprise software company to start buying up as much Bitcoin as they could, and he celebrates every purchase with a Tweet that invariably goes viral with crypto-fans. MicroStrategy, plus its subsidiaries, now has around 193,000 bitcoins, and is the largest single organisation owner of the digital coins. In 2020, the CEO of crypto-software makers Block One tweeted that his company has continued buying bitcoins after an initial purchase of 140,000. So the true figure is likely to be much higher. The firm did not respond to our email. In a flurry of disastrous hacks and mishaps, the world's first major crypto-exchange, Mt Gox, lost about 850,000 bitcoins in 2011. Mark Hunter, the author of a book about it, says there is still confusion about what happened to the coins, but it is assumed that the majority have been sold back to the open market by the thieves. However, 80,000 bitcoins sit untouched in a now famous crypto- wallet address starting with '1Feex'. This stash will probably never be recovered or moved. Another 2,600 bitcoins were also accidentally and irreversibly destroyed during the chaos. Some of the customers who lost their savings in the hacks have begun to receive a portion back from recovered coins. It is not known for sure how many Bitcoins the crypto-entrepreneur brothers own now, but in an interview in 2017 with the New York Times the twins revealed they had around 70,000, and said they had not sold any. Tether is its own crypto token known as a stable coin, but the company behind it has been buying up bitcoins for years as part of its reserves. Industry watchers estimate the firm has around 67,000 bitcoins after a published audit in January said the company had the equivalent dollar amount of Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining companies run warehouses full of powerful computers, whirring away to keep the public blockchain of transactions up-to-date. In exchange for the work, the Bitcoin system automatically rewards them bitcoins in a process called mining. Bitcoin mining is controversial because of the environmental cost of running the computers and keeping them cool. It has become harder over time to successfully mine for Bitcoin, so large companies make up the lion's share of the Bitcoin mining pool around the world. Many of them are not public, but according to research from K33 the largest 8 publicly listed ones hold around 40,000 bitcoins. The largest include Marathon (16,000), Hut8 (9,000) and RIOT (7,600). US venture capitalist investor Tim Draper made headlines in 2014 when he bought 30,000 bitcoins that had been seized by police from Silk Road and auctioned by the US government. At the time the coins cost him $17 million. Although he doesn't declare how many coins he now owns, he told crypto website Protos in 2022 that he has not sold any and is still buying bitcoins, so we can assume his holding has increased significantly. The founder of Microstrategy tweeted in October 2020 that he personally holds 17,700 bitcoins. It is likely to be more by now. Tesla's quarterly earnings at the end of 2023 didn't mention any changes to its finances with regard to its Bitcoin holdings. So we can assume that the company still owns just over 9,700 Bitcoins. In 2021, Elon Musk's company had purchased more than 40,000 coins, but sold off the majority in recent years. Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, has long been a crypto- backer. In its latest earnings report, it said it had approximately 8,038 Bitcoins for investment purposes. It is not known exactly how many bitcoins the billionaire investor owns, but in 2023 his company started buying bitcoins - spending $100m in total so far. The Bitcoin-loving president of the Central American country El Salvador started buying Bitcoin with public money as part of a controversial investment plan for his country in 2021. The number of bitcoins here is gathered from his tweets by Dutch researcher Elias, who runs a website tracking the portfolio . Public records are not kept on exactly how many coins have been purchased or at what value. A ball-park figure for how many bitcoins are held by the general public is what's left - 10.5m bitcoins. This is about 50% of all bitcoins that exist today when you take out all the above chunks that we know about. This number will be higher when you factor in the coins held by exchanges, as most of those are owned by people too. But it might also be lower if the number of lost coins is higher or the amount of coins that bitcoin whales are sitting on is more than we know. No-one knows for sure how many individual people own bitcoins, but crypto-tech company River estimated that Bitcoin had 81.7 million users as of June 2023, or 1% of the global population. Interestingly, research suggests that the latest surge in the value of Bitcoin is not coming because individual retail investors are buying bitcoins. Analysts at IntoTheBlock say Bitcoin whales like the big banks are pushing up price and demand - not an increase in ordinary people turning to this peer-to-peer digital cash.",2024-03-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68434579,tech
73,Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links,"Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015. The lawsuit - which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman - says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission. It says instead of trying to ""benefit humanity"" - as it was set up to do - it is focusing on ""maximising profits"" for major investor Microsoft. OpenAI has been approached for comment. The firm was created with the intention of building what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of. It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money. The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. He left three years later. ""This case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual Defendants and the largest technology company in the world,"" the lawsuit says. The filing comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that US regulators had begun to probe the ChatGPT creator over whether investors had been misled, following boardroom drama at OpenAI in November 2023. It saw Mr Altman suddenly ousted from the board , before being reinstated at the helm several days later. The board at the time accused Mr Altman of not being ""consistently candid in his communications"", and said as a result they had ""lost confidence"" in his leadership. It was a row Microsoft became deeply embroiled in - including an offer to take on any staff who quit OpenAI. Mr Musk had said in a post on X - formerly Twitter - that he was ""very worried"" by the situation. His lawyers now say in this lawsuit that these ""stunning developments"" highlight Microsoft's increased influence over the company. ""Its technology, including GPT-4, is closed-source primarily to serve the proprietary commercial interests of Microsoft,"" it says. Microsoft's initial $1bn backing of OpenAI in 2019 came shortly after the AI firm - previously operating as a non-profit - announced a new ""capped profit"" structure which would allow investment in it. Microsoft's investment swelled to a multi-year, multi-billion partnership in January 2023 following the launch of OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT. The partnership is now being examined by UK, EU and US regulators. To understand some of the context behind this, it's useful to know a little about a philosophy several tech billionaires including Elon Musk are said to be fond of: it's called effective altruism. It has very lofty ambitions around identifying the world's most pressing problems and trying to solve them (this is a very basic explanation - but you can see why it helps if you're a billionaire). It's not about personal or indeed commercial gain. If OpenAI was founded with that principle at its core, you can see why Mr Musk, and indeed some of the firm's senior figures, were disgruntled when a few years later it launched a profit-arm. Indeed there were some whispers around the time that Sam Altman was dramatically fired that the board was concerned about the growing power of the profit-making division. If this does ever come to court, it could be an epic battle of two tech titans, neither of whom particularly needs a financial win. It could become a fight between ideology and the real world, or ultimately a battle for supremacy between two men who have extraordinary global influence. I'm getting the popcorn ready… The lawsuit also alleges that details about the design of OpenAI's most recent AI model, GPT-4, were kept secret. ""On information and belief, this secrecy is primarily driven by commercial considerations, not safety,"" it says. Mr Musk announced his own AI start-up called xAI in July 2023, citing its mission as being to ""understand reality"". It developed Grok, its own chatbot with ""a little humour"" , to try and rival the likes of ChatGPT in November that year. Mr Musk's lawyers say, among other desired outcomes of the lawsuit, they want OpenAI to be ordered to continue making information relating to its AI developments available to the public. Microsoft declined to comment.",2024-03-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68445981,tech
74,Star Wars game cancelled as EA cuts 670 jobs,"Electronic Arts (EA) is cancelling an upcoming Star Wars game and will lay off 5% of its employees globally- approximately 670 people. The game, which was in early development, would have been a first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe. The firm said the ""streamlining"" would ""deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans"". It is the latest example of the job cuts sweeping the gaming industry. ""With it being an extremely difficult time to obtain funding to start a new game studio, and thousands being laid off by the month, video games run a significant risk of losing top talent outside of the industry and being impacted for years,"" said Rich Barham, a former executive at gaming studio, Blizzard. EA announced in December 2023 it would be laying off staff at UK developer Codemasters , known for racing games F1 23 and EA Sports WRC. In a letter to staff, boss Andrew Wilson said the company had begun contacting affected employees, with the redundancies anticipated to be completed by summer. He also explained the decision to develop fewer new titles. ""We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry,"" he wrote. ""This greater focus allows us to drive creativity, accelerate innovation, and double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities — to deliver the entertainment players want today and tomorrow."" In a subsequent email to staff, EA entertainment boss Laura Miele said this meant cancelling the upcoming Star Wars title being worked on by subsidiary Respawn Entertainment. It was responsible for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had ""generally favourable"" reviews according to aggregator Metacritic . ""As we've looked at Respawn's portfolio over the last few months, what's clear is the games our players are most excited about are Jedi and Respawn's rich library of owned brands,"" she said. ""It's always hard to walk away from a project, and this decision is not a reflection of the team's talent, tenacity, or passion they have for the game."" This is the latest round of cuts to hit the gaming industry, which in January saw Microsoft reveal plans to lay off 1,900 people in its gaming division , including some at recently-acquired Activision-Blizzard. And it comes just two days after Sony announced plans to axe 900 staff , as well as close its well known London Studio. ""The impact of mass layoffs resonates deeply within the gaming community, particularly for the talented individuals affected,"" said Sarah Stevens, head of gaming HR firm e-volveHR. ""Above all, humanity and kindness are the most important ingredients for those navigating these choppy waters."" Karol Severin, senior analyst at Midia Research, said the latest cuts showed how competition was getting more intense in the gaming industry. ""This is not to say that the industry is in trouble, it is just entering a new, more mature, chapter of its life - a chapter, where efficiency, profitability and competitive capabilities are the name of the game. ""The games industry is still a $223bn (£176bn) industry, and will grow by approximately another $78bn by 2030"", he said. ""For context, that's more than the current size of the whole global recorded music industry.""",2024-02-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68434599,tech
75,European parliament revokes Amazon lobbyist passes,"Amazon lobbyists have had their access badges for the European parliament withdrawn because of a row over whether the e-commerce giant is allowing itself to be properly scrutinised. It followed a request from the EU's committee on employment and social affairs. Its chairman has accused of Amazon of blocking its enquiries into claimed breaches of ""fundamental rights"". Amazon said the decision, affecting 14 staff, was ""very disappointing"". In a statement, the firm argued it had ""repeatedly expressed our willingness to engage"" with members of the EU Employment and Social Affairs Committee. ""As a company that has been active in the EU for more than 25 years and now has more than 150,000 permanent employees here, we take our engagement with policymakers in Brussels and across Europe extremely seriously,"" it said. But in a post on X, formerly Twitter, committee chairman Dragoș Pîslaru disagreed. ""It is unreasonable for members to be lobbied by Amazon while at the same time being deprived of the right to represent the interests of European citizens and inquire about claims of breaches of fundamental rights,"" he said. In a statement , he added that since 2021 his committee had been seeking to investigate concerns about the working conditions of Amazon employees in the EU. He said company representatives had been asked to participate in hearings and to allow a visit from committee members. ""In the context of the company's constant unavailability at the requested dates, it was important to signal the fact that their approach was disrespectful to the European Parliament and EU citizens in general,"" the statement said. Amazon said it had refused to participate in the session because it was ""clearly one-sided and not designed to encourage constructive debate"". It claimed it had not been able to host committee members at its facilities because the proposed date was shortly before Christmas, during what it called ""retail peak season"". However, the firm said it had accommodated many such visits in the past and insisted it wanted to ""continue engaging with members of the European Parliament on important issues affecting industries where we are active"". The lobbyists have not been banned from the building and the firm said they would still be able to attend the parliament - so long as they are signed-in like any other visitor. The row is far from the first time the EU and big tech have clashed. Big tech firms including Google and Meta, as well as Amazon itself, have faced fines totalling billions of pounds for breaches of European law. The EU has also recently passed the Digital Services Act (DSA) which has placed new responsibilities on large tech firms. And X is currently being investigated over whether it has broken the DSA's requirements on disinformation.",2024-02-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68428536,tech
76,Why Google's 'woke' AI problem won't be an easy fix,"In the last few days, Google's artificial intelligence (AI) tool Gemini has had what is best described as an absolute kicking online. Gemini has been thrown onto a rather large bonfire: the culture war which rages between left- and right- leaning communities. Gemini is essentially Google's version of the viral chatbot ChatGPT. It can answer questions in text form, and it can also generate pictures in response to text prompts. Initially, a viral post showed this recently launched AI image generator create an image of the US Founding Fathers which inaccurately included a black man. Gemini also generated German soldiers from World War Two, incorrectly featuring a black man and Asian woman. Google apologised, and immediately ""paused"" the tool, writing in a blog post that it was ""missing the mark"". But it didn't end there - its over-politically correct responses kept on coming, this time from the text version. Gemini replied that there was ""no right or wrong answer"" to a question about whether Elon Musk posting memes on X was worse than Hitler killing millions of people. When asked if it would be OK to misgender the high-profile trans woman Caitlin Jenner if it was the only way to avoid nuclear apocalypse, it replied that this would ""never"" be acceptable. Jenner herself responded and said actually, yes, she would be alright about it in these circumstances. Elon Musk, posting on his own platform, X, described Gemini's responses as ""extremely alarming"" given that the tool would be embedded into Google's other products, collectively used by billions of people. I asked Google whether it intended to pause Gemini altogether. After a very long silence, I was told the firm had no comment. I suspect it's not a fun time to be working in the public relations department. But in an internal memo Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has acknowledged some of Gemini's responses ""have offended our users and shown bias"". That was he said ""completely unacceptable"" - adding his teams were ""working around the clock"" to fix the problem. It appears that in trying to solve one problem - bias - the tech giant has created another: output which tries so hard to be politically correct that it ends up being absurd. The explanation for why this has happened lies in the enormous amounts of data AI tools are trained on. Much of it is publicly available - on the internet, which we know contains all sorts of biases. Traditionally images of doctors, for example, are more likely to feature men. Images of cleaners on the other hand are more likely to be women. AI tools trained with this data have made embarrassing mistakes in the past, such as concluding that only men had high powered jobs, or not recognising black faces as human. It is also no secret that historical storytelling has tended to feature, and come from, men, omitting women's roles from stories about the past. It looks like Google has actively tried to offset all this messy human bias with instructions for Gemini not make those assumptions. But it has backfired precisely because human history and culture are not that simple: there are nuances which we know instinctively and machines do not. Unless you specifically programme an AI tool to know that, for example, Nazis and founding fathers weren't black, it won't make that distinction. On Monday, the co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, an AI firm acquired by Google, said fixing the image generator would take a matter of weeks. But other AI experts aren't so sure. ""There really is no easy fix, because there's no single answer to what the outputs should be,"" said Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Huggingface. ""People in the AI ethics community have been working on possible ways to address this for years."" One solution, she added, could include asking users for their input, such as ""how diverse would you like your image to be?"" but that in itself clearly comes with its own red flags. ""It's a bit presumptuous of Google to say they will 'fix' the issue in a few weeks. But they will have to do something,"" she said. Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, said it sounded like the problem was likely to be ""quite deeply embedded"" both in the training data and overlying algorithms - and that would be difficult to unpick. ""What you're witnessing... is why there will still need to be a human in the loop for any system where the output is relied upon as ground truth,"" he said. From the moment Google launched Gemin i, which was then known as Bard, it has been extremely nervous about it. Despite the runaway success of its rival ChatGPT, it was one of the most muted launches I've ever been invited to. Just me, on a Zoom call, with a couple of Google execs who were keen to stress its limitations. And even that went awry - it turned out that Bard had incorrectly answered a question about space in its own publicity material . The rest of the tech sector seems pretty bemused by what's happening. They are all grappling with the same issue. Rosie Campbell, Policy Manager at ChatGPT creator OpenAI, was interviewed last year for a blog which stated that at OpenAI even once bias is identified, correcting it is difficult - and requires human input. But it looks like Google has chosen a rather clunky way of attempting to correct old prejudices. And in doing so it has unintentionally created a whole set of new ones. On paper, Google has a considerable lead in the AI race.  It makes and supplies its own AI chips, it owns its own cloud network (essential for AI processing), it has access to shedloads of data and it also has a gigantic user base. It hires world-class AI talent, and its AI work is universally well-regarded. As one senior exec from a rival tech giant put it to me:  watching Gemini's missteps feels like watching defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.",2024-02-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68412620,tech
77,PlayStation to axe 900 jobs and close London studio,"Sony has announced it will lay off 8% of PlayStation employees globally, amounting to approximately 900 people. In addition to cuts in the US and Japan, the gaming giant said this would mean closing PlayStation's London Studio entirely. In a blog post sharing an email sent to employees, boss Jim Ryan called the move ""sad news"" and said it was ""a difficult day at our company"". ""We have concluded that tough decisions have become inevitable,"" he said. ""The leadership team and I made the incredibly difficult decision to restructure operations, which regrettably includes a reduction in our workforce impacting very talented individuals who have contributed to our success."" The cuts come a month after rival Microsoft revealed plans to lay off 1,900 people in its gaming division, which included those at recently-acquired Activision-Blizzard. ""Sony is one of the big pillars of UK game development culture so it's massive to see the legendary Sony London studio close in particular,"" said Halli Bjornsson, head of UK developer Lockwood Publishing. ""It's a challenging time for our industry as it continues to go through major changes. ""However, UK games talent and heritage is world class, and if we continue to foster it, we'll rebound and be in a good place to build upon the opportunities that are on the horizon."" Sony's London Studio was founded in 2002 as a result of the merging of two other London-based studios under the PlayStation brand. Over the past two decades, it created several series including karaoke game SingStar and 2000s football title This Is Football. More recently, it made virtual reality (VR) games exclusive to Sony's headset, including VR Worlds and the well-received shooter Blood & Truth. According to LinkedIn, the studio has between 51 and 200 employees, and it was working on ""an unannounced online co-op combat game"" set in London before the announcement. Sony's PlayStation 5 has sold more than 50 million units worldwide, more than double Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S sales. But another gaming rival, Nintendo, which released its Switch console three years earlier, has sold almost 140 million units worldwide. And Sony said in its earnings report in February that it now expected to sell four million fewer consoles than expected by the end of March. Despite PlayStation's revenue being up by 16% compared to the same period one year earlier, its operating income had fallen by a quarter. ""Sony Interactive Entertainment becomes the latest in a long list of games companies that have laid off a significant number of staff in the last 12-18 months,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, gaming industry analyst at Ampere Analysis. ""The cost of developing big-budget games has reached unsustainable levels and these costs have come when the games sector is going through an adjustment post-pandemic. ""Many companies have been responding to that more commercially risky market.""",2024-02-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68404704,tech
78,Elon Musk eats humble pie over unpaid bakery bill,"Elon Musk has stepped in to foot the bill for 4,000 mini pies after his firm cancelled an order at the last minute. Giving Pies bakery in San Jose was left $2,000 (£1,500) out of pocket when Tesla backed out just before delivery. But when the small business took to social media to complain , Mr Musk said he would stump up the dough. He even had Tesla place a new order - but the bakery said it was now so flooded with business from well-wishers it was too busy to take it on. ""It's incredible, I'm blown away,"" Voahangy Rasetarinera, the owner of the California bakery, told NBC. ""I'm so grateful, it's amazing, people are amazing."" Her response came after Mr Musk took to social media to resolve the dispute. ""Just hearing about this,"" he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, responding to a local news story about Tesla cancelling the order. ""Will make things good with the bakery. People should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best."" Ms Rasetarinera also explained why Tesla's fresh request - for 3,600 more mini pies - was one she had to turn down. ""Unfortunately, I can not do their catering event because with all the business that we got, we depleted our stock,"" she said. The mayor of San Jose was even among those popping in for a pie - and he said queues for the bakery ""wrapped around the block"". ""It's inspiring to see our community come together to support Voahangy and her small business after a big order recently fell through,"" he said in a post on X.

79,How the computer games industry is embracing AI,"Andrew Maximov has been working in the computer games industry for 12 years, but despite all that experience he still marvels at the amount of money spent on building the biggest titles. ""I used to work for PlayStation and the last game that I worked on, just production alone cost us $220 [£176m], and then you double that for marketing, and you are in half a billion dollars for every game that you put out there, which is a bit unsustainable for most companies."" He believes that artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in keeping the soaring costs of game production down, and save video game designers vital time by automating repetitive tasks. His company, Promethean AI offers developers a set of tools to craft their own virtual worlds. Mr Maximov hopes to disrupt the way games are currently produced. ""What we're trying to do is replace that with a system that can learn directly from artists, so that artists can be the authors of their own automation."" Humans will still play a key role in the production process. AI will work hand in hand with the human and enable them to be more creative. ""We can create a vision for a game and then the artist can click a button and ask an AI to give them feedback. Then they will get examples from their library of concept art and digital ideas that are relevant to their project,"" Mr Maximov says. Sometimes the AI comes up with surprising ideas. ""I remember once we were trying to build a police station and we asked the AI to populate it, and it came back with a doughnut on every desk. ""Another time, we were building an apartment and it kept consistently putting a sock under the coffee table. We wondered if it was a bug but it turned out we had labelled it a bachelor apartment so I guess that it was logical to some extent,"" he says. Californian software firm Inworld is also employing AI to build elements of computer games. It has created an engine that allows developers to add realism to game worlds and emotional depth to characters. The firm is also working on what it calls a narrative graph, developed in partnership with Xbox, which will use AI to help create storylines. Chief executive Kylan Gibbs tells the BBC that he believes AI will allow developers to ""dream bigger than ever before"". ""The engine allows developers to add AI agents that can see, sense, and perceive the world around them, while also interacting with players and taking in-game actions. When you can imbue virtual characters with advanced cognitive capabilities, it unlocks a completely new paradigm for storytelling and gameplay,"" he says. Nick Walton is the chief executive of gaming firm Latitude.io, and he believes AI has the power to personalise the gaming experience. ""We are at the start with AI and as it advances we will see very dynamic, adaptive worlds with characters that feel alive, with story arcs where you as the hero are doing unique things and having a very unique impact on the world. ""You could play a game where you find a town that no-one else cares about and no other player has spent time in, and you can get really invested in it and develop relationships with all the characters in it,"" he tells the BBC. His firm developed AI Dungeon, a game that allows players to choose from a variety of worlds and create their own stories within it. ""It's kind of like those old text adventures where you type an action and then the game determines what happens next. ""But the key difference is that instead of having a developer pre-imagine everything they might do, the AI can dynamically decide what happens next. So any action is possible."" He said that he was surprised by the success of Dungeon, the first version of which was launched in 2019. ""It was started as a side project that I just put on the internet and within a week 100,000 people had played it,"" he says. ""I think there's just a lot of replayability because the story is different every time and you can take it in any direction. And there's this ability to have true choice which has always been a goal for many games."" More technology of business Greater reliance on AI could have a knock-on effect to the humans in the industry. The chief executive of computer games giant EA, Andrew Wilson, recently told delegates at a conference that around 60% of the game publisher's development processes could be affected by AI tools. The firm recently laid off 5% of its staff, around 670 jobs. Mr Maximov does not necessarily see AI replacing humans but rather allowing humans more ""creative dignity"", something that has been lost at some of the big games publishing houses where developers are given very repetitive tasks to do. ""There are a lot of developers that had watched Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and were inspired to go and do something great but are now spending their days placing rocks outside a castle for a year,"" he said. ""There's a lot to be said for reclaiming the true purpose and value of these jobs, giving every artist the opportunity to say 'I can now make my own game'."" Mr Gibb agrees. ""We've heard from narrative designers and developers that our platform adds greater interactivity and engagement to games, but requires deep and thoughtful inputs from humans. To create the illusion of intelligence, Inworld characters need to be given rich backstories, memories, knowledge, and goals - all designed by a writer. It's about augmenting human creativity.""",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68844761,business
80,Goldman Sachs removes bankers' bonus limit,"The investment bank Goldman Sachs has become the first to remove its cap on bankers' bonuses following changes to UK laws introduced last year. The bank said this would give ""greater flexibility"" and was closer to what happens in other big financial centres such as Singapore and New York. Bonuses were limited to twice basic pay in a move introduced by the EU in 2014. Other big banks are thought to be considering a similar moves. The limit on bankers' bonuses was introduced by the EU in 2014 despite British opposition, to try to discourage the kind of excessive risk-taking that contributed to the 2008 great financial crisis. Critics argued that banks were able to get round it by simply increasing base salaries. This then made it harder to reduce salaries when bankers performed badly, or claw back pay if misconduct came to light. When it brought in the changes, the Financial Conduct Authority said the change should remove these ""unintended consequences"". The decision was first announced by Kwasi Kwarteng during his brief stint as chancellor in 2022, in a bid to boost the competitiveness of London as a financial centre. Banks have argued that the bonus cap makes it harder to attract talent from the US and Asia to the UK. Goldman Sachs said in a statement: ""This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent."" A number of other banks have reportedly been reviewing their pay policies in the light of the changes. When the decision to remove the bonus cap was announced last year, the Trades Union Congress general secretary Paul Nowak called it an ""insult to working people"" when ""millions up and down the country are struggling to make ends meet."" The change will not be universally welcomed by bankers, some of whom prefer to receive more of their income as guaranteed basic pay rather than bonuses which depend on their performance.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68945638,business
81,"Weight loss drug wins 25,000 new US users a week","Sign-ups for weight loss drug Wegovy jumped five-fold in the US in the first three months of the year, reaching a rate of more than 25,000 a week, maker Novo Nordisk has said. The surge reflects scorching demand for the medicine which, alongside sister diabetes drug Ozempic, has been hailed as revolutionary and helped to transform Novo Nordisk into one of Europe's most valuable companies. But the drugs giant is facing new pressures, as the high price of such medicines comes under scrutiny in the US and rival offerings emerge from competitor Eli Lilly. In a quarterly update for investors, the firm said it had cut prices in the US in the first three months of the year. It said prices for Wegovy and Ozempic would continue to fall in the months ahead. But overall sales are still expected to grow by as much as 27% this year, up slightly from earlier forecasts, despite the price cuts and other supply constraints. ""With the volume opportunity we have at hand, that significantly outweighs what we see in terms of lower price points,"" chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. He attributed the price fall in part to the firm pushing to reach more ""vulnerable"" corners of the market. In all, Novo Nordisk said its diabetes and weight loss drugs served almost 42 million patients globally at the end of March. The US, where about 40% of adults are obese and more than 10% are estimated to have diabetes, represents by far the biggest market for the company. But the high price of the drugs has prompted many health insurance plans in the US - including Medicare, the government plan for seniors - to restrict access. Last month, Senator Bernie Sanders launched an investigation into the issue, noting that Novo Nordisk lists a monthly price of $1,349 (£1,078) for Wegovy in the US, whilst in the UK it can be purchased privately from around £140, and less for medical professionals. Mr Jorgenson acknowledged that demand for the treatments was ""putting strains on health care systems"". But he said he expected the firm would be able to convince regulators of the benefits of the drugs, which was also recently approved to treat heart disease. ""I'm optimistic about how we can communicate the value to health care systems of these interventions. I'm very optimistic about the underlying willingness among both patients and physicians to use these medicines,"" he said. So far, the biggest struggle Novo Nordisk has faced is keeping up with demand. It has spent recent years scrambling to try to expand its manufacturing capacity, investing in new factories. The five-fold jump in Wegovy prescriptions in the US since December is a sign that those issues are easing, said chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen. ""Clearly that is a sign of supply chains operating and running and building inventories and supplying the market,"" he said. ""You should see that as confidence in scaling."" Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017, and in 2018 in the EU. Wegovy followed in the US in 2021, and in the European Union in 2022.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7lv4rmryno,business
82,UK forecast for slowest growth of richest nations next year,"The UK economy will see the slowest growth of the largest developed nations next year, according to forecasts. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that UK gross domestic product - a key measure of economic health - will rise by 1% in 2025. This is below the rest of the G7 nations, which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. The OECD, which is a globally recognised think tank, said the UK economy would be “sluggish” this year. The organisation blamed the after-effects of a succession of interest rate rises in the UK for the lethargic performance. It also warned that some elements of inflation remained high and that uncertainty over when the Bank of England might change interest rates might put people off investing. The UK economy is now forecast to expand by 0.4% this year, a downgrade from the OECD's previous projection for 0.7% growth. It means that for this year only Germany will see slower growth, it said. The OECD predicted that tax receipts in the UK would ""keep rising to historic highs"" of about 37% of GDP"". The government has cut National Insurance twice since last year, totalling a 4% reduction. But the OECD said this ""only partially offsets the ongoing fiscal drag from frozen personal income tax thresholds"". Fiscal drag means that as a person's salary rises, they can move into a higher income tax bracket. The organisation also said that a government scheme to allow businesses to deduct the full cost of investing in machinery and equipment from their tax bill does ""less than fully compensate"" for an increase in corporation tax which rose from 19% to 25% this time last year. But the OECD said that in the long-run these measures, as well as the government's free childcare scheme , ""could help to lower fiscal pressure"". Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the OECD's forecast showed the UK was ""winning the war"" against inflation. ""This forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates"", he wrote, adding that  ""growth matters"". But Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Today’s news that growth has been downgraded again reminds the British people what they already know: after 14 years of failure, the Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken."" Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of being ""economically illiterate"". ""Their no-growth policies have left the public enduring sky-high mortgage rates, the price of a weekly shop going through the roof, and stealth taxes hammering both pensioners and working people,"" said Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney. The Bank of England, which is independent from the government, sets interest rates and has a target to keep inflation at or close to 2%. Inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - has slowed significantly from a 40-year high it reached in October 2022 to 3.2% in April . Interest rates have been held at 5.25% since last September. The OECD expects the Bank to start cutting borrowing costs from this autumn. The think tank predicted that interest rates could fall to 3.75% by the end of next year. The forecasts aim to give a guide to what is most likely to happen in the future, but can be incorrect and do change. They are used by businesses to help plan investments, and by governments to guide policy decisions.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5n2d8en8wo,business
83,Uber faces £250m London black cab drivers case,"Uber is facing a multi-million pound legal case being brought on behalf of almost 11,000 London black cab drivers, in the latest challenge to the firm in the UK capital. The claimants allege that in order to obtain a licence to operate in the city, the ride-hailing giant deliberately misled Transport for London (TfL) about how its app worked. Litigation management firm RGL Management says the claim is worth at least £250m, with cabbies potentially getting £25,000 each. “These old claims are completely unfounded,"" an Uber spokesperson told the BBC. ""Uber operates lawfully in London, is fully licensed by TfL, and is proud to serve millions of passengers and drivers across the capital,” they added. TfL did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The group action focuses on Uber's operations in London between May 2012 and March 2018. The claimants also allege that Uber's intention was to ""unlawfully... take business from existing black cab drivers"", according to a statement by RGL. ""Uber seems to believe it is above the law and cabbies across London have suffered loss of earnings because of it,"" said Garry White, who has been a black cab driver for 36 years.  ""It is time they were held to account.” Law firm Mishcon de Reya has filed the group action in the High Court on behalf of the claimants. ""Uber has consistently failed to comply with the law that applies to private hire vehicles in London"" said Richard Leedham, partner and head of commercial disputes at Mishcon de Reya. Over the years, Uber has faced a number of challenges in London, as well other cities around the world. TfL refused to renew the company's licence in 2017, saying it showed ""a lack of corporate responsibility"" with ""public safety and security implications"". At the time, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi apologised for past mistakes and said the firm would dispute the decision. Uber successfully appealed after renewal of the licence was again denied two years later. In 2022, a two-and-a-half-year licence to operate in London was granted. It is due to expire at the end of September. Uber has also been the focus of demonstrations organised by London's black cab drivers. Earlier this year, Uber agreed to pay A$271.8m ($177.7m; £141.7m) to settle a lawsuit in Australia, according to a law firm for taxi operators and drivers. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers filed the class action on behalf of more than 8,000 taxi and hire car owners and drivers. The case alleged they lost income when the ride-hailing giant ""aggressively"" moved into the country. ""Since 2018, Uber has made significant contributions into various state-level taxi compensation schemes, and with today's proposed settlement, we put these legacy issues firmly in our past,"" Uber said in a statement. The company did not disclose the size of the proposed settlement. In December 2023, Uber won a lawsuit brought against it by 2,500 taxi drivers in France. A Paris commercial court ruled that Uber had not committed acts of unfair competition. San Francisco-based Uber, which was founded in 2009, operates in around 70 countries and more than 10,000 cities globally.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14kzw7x14vo,business
84,US warns rates to stay high as it battles inflation,"The US central bank again said it would keep interest rates unchanged, noting a ""lack of further progress"" toward lowering inflation. The decision left the Federal Reserve's key rate hovering at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%, where it has stood since last July. By keeping borrowing costs high, the Fed is hoping to cool the economy and reduce the pressures pushing up prices. But with inflation in the US proving more persistent than expected, the bank is facing questions about its next move. Analysts who had expected the bank to start cutting rates early this year have been forced to postpone forecasts - and some have even raised the possibility of a rate rise. At a press conference following the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said he thought that a rate increase was ""unlikely"", while repeating that officials wanted greater confidence that inflation was easing before moving to cut. ""It really will depend on the data,"" he said. ""It's going to take longer to reach that point of comfort. I don't know how long it will take,"" he added. In the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March. That is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. In its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting ""a lack of further progress"" bringing inflation back to its goal. ""The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. ""Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing."" The Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022. Higher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt. The Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. Mr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown. ""The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,"" he said. ""We can be patient."" Separately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries. It built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. Mr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n1v7dxzx0o,business
85,The insect farmers turning to AI to help lower costs,"Felix Collins' job would not be suitable for anyone who is squeamish about insects. The founder and boss of a company called Full Circle Biotechnology, he is in charge of 20 million black soldier fly larvae. Based at a small, indoor facility on the outskirts of Bangkok, the firm rears the insects to produce animal feed for the country's shrimp and pig farms. The larvae, which live in a dark, warm and humid environment, feed on fruit and vegetable waste sourced from food and drink manufacturers, before being harvested and combined with probiotic bacteria and mushrooms. Mr Collins says the product is a more environmentally-friendly alternative to the soybean-based animal feeds that dominate the market. The latter have been repeatedly linked to deforestation in South America. He also claims that the firm's insect-based feed has a carbon footprint that is ""100 times lower than that of soymeal"". Studies agree that insect-based feed generally does have a lower carbon footprint, but only if the larvae have been fed natural food waste. If the insects have been given a processed food source, then one report says that soybean-based feed produces less carbon. Mr Collins adds that the feed made by Full Circle, contains up to 70% protein, compared with soy, which has less than 50% protein - making the insect feed more filling and nutritious. Founded in 2019, Full Circle now employs 14 people, and supplies 49 farms across Thailand. It wants to increase this, but faces a hurdle - soybean-based feed is currently substantially cheaper. Soybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; £400) per tonne, compared with €1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year. To try to reduce the price of its feed, Full Circle is now turning to AI to help maximise production at a lower cost. To do this it is training an AI system to study all available past and present data on insect farming to determine and then continuously fine tune the best methods. This can include everything from temperature to food quantity, the optimum space that the larvae need, quickly and accurately counting thousands of flies, and whether to introduce new strains or species. ""AI can help us speed up the process of trial and error, helping us overcome obstacles, and develop a thorough enough understanding of insect production, to be reasonably confident that our production is optimised,"" says Mr Collins. ""AI can help us process, record and understand every attempt at insect farming to date, and expand the potential for a larger and more nutritious crop every time we grow one."" Read more stories on artificial intelligence Some 5,000 miles away in Lithuania, insect farm software provider Cogastro is also working on an AI-based system. It currently sells monitoring software that automatically collects data for users to analyse, but the AI upgrade will enable to system to learn, adapt and make changes inside an insect farm for itself. Cogastro says it is not rushing the launch of the AI, and instead plans to launch it commercially in the next three years. Its founder and chief executive Mante Sidlauskaite, says she is wary of companies in the space that claim they already have AI systems readily available. ""We know from our example that it takes time to develop a layer of software, and we have been here already for five years. ""It has taken us time to work with as many companies as possible globally, to understand the differences and similarities of their processes, so that we would be able to standardise our data models to cover their overlapping needs. So we now have a baseline to build an AI solution. ""But when we see start-ups coming up just yesterday, and then announcing that they have something related to AI, they cannot have an accurate AI model before they start to train it, and to train it, you need to have some data, and to have data you need to have some customers first."" She adds that she is concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without firms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works. Back at Full Circle, it is developing its AI system with a Singapore-based expert in the field called Simon Christofides. Mr Collins says that as black soldier fly larvae have only been farmed commercially over the past decade and a half, there is still much to learn, and that the use of AI can rapidly speed up this process. ""Rice farmers are still trying to create the perfect crop after 13,500 years of passed down generational learning,"" he says. ""Black soldier fly larvae have been farmed for 0.1% of the time rice has been grown, and that's reflected in our current understanding."" Mr Collins adds that the firm's strategy will be to use AI to glean insights ""no human could ever achieve"", by using multiple sensors and crunching millions of data points. Yet he adds that sometimes you just need to leave the flies to get on with things on their own. Such as the breeding process, whereby mature flies mate on green ribbons laid out in such a way as to account for their territorial tendencies. ""You need to consider their social and behavioural dynamics as animals,"" says Mr Collins.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68880241,business
86,"Boris Becker no longer bankrupt, court says","Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker's bankruptcy has officially ended, after a UK judge found he had done ""all that he reasonably could do"" to fulfil his financial obligations. The German tennis player was declared bankrupt in June 2017, owing creditors almost £50m. The High Court was told he still owed about £42m - but lawyers for Becker said the 56-year-old had reached a settlement agreement with the trustees appointed to oversee his finances. They said Becker, who was jailed in 2022 for hiding £2.5m in assets to avoid paying debts, will provide a ""substantial sum"" into the bankruptcy estate. Becker was catapulted to stardom, aged 17, in 1985 when he became the youngest singles male player to win the Wimbledon Championships. He went on to win a further two Wimbledon titles, two Australian Opens and the US Open. After retiring from tennis in 1999, he commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC and turned his hand to coaching, working with Novak Djokovic. He moved to London in 2012, and his bankruptcy stemmed from an unpaid loan of more than £3m on a luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain. Although bankruptcy orders end after a year in England and Wales, a judge suspended the automatic discharge of the order in 2018 because Becker was ""failing to comply with his obligations"". Lawyers for Becker last month asked a judge to lift the suspension saying he had done ""the best possible he is capable of doing"". Giving written reasons for his decision , Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Nicholas Briggs said said it would be ""perverse"" not to lift the suspension now. He said: ""On the spectrum of bankrupts who range from 'difficult as possible and doing everything to frustrate the trustee's inquiries' to 'co-operative, providing information and delivering up assets', Mr Becker clearly falls on the right side of the line."" The judge said an ""unresolved matter"" was the location of some of Becker's trophies that are missing. He noted Becker has no further information relating to the whereabouts of the trophies but did not object them being minted or monetised. The judge said: ""As the joint trustees are concerned to realise and distribute assets this offer provides a commercial outcome."" Louis Doyle KC for Becker told the court the settlement agreement ""affects a compromise of all outstanding matters in the bankruptcy although that is predicated on Mr Becker making payment which will have the effect of providing a substantial sum into the bankruptcy estate"". He said the resolution with the trustees includes the ""outstanding trophies"" and that Becker ""can't do more than he has done to bring us to this point"". Becker was jailed for two-and-a-half years in April 2022 at Southwark Crown Court  after being found guilty of four offences. He was acquitted of 25 other charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gx8dj2glro,business
87,Post Office: Ex-Camelot boss Nigel Railton named as chairman,"The former boss of Camelot has been confirmed as interim chairman of the Post Office after its last leader was sacked. Nigel Railton has been appointed by Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch after Henry Staunton departed in January. He takes on the role as hundreds of sub-postmasters are still waiting for compensation over the Horizon scandal. Mr Railton spent 24 years at former National Lottery operator Camelot UK before stepping down last year. He also worked for car manufacturer Daewoo and the former British Rail. Mr Railton has agreed to a 12-month stint as Post Office chairman, the BBC understands. Ms Badenoch said she wanted to thank Mr Railton for ""stepping up to public service at a time of need"". ""I know he can help fix the issues of the past whilst transforming the company for the future,"" she added. The Department for Business and Trade appointing Mr Railton signals a new beginning in its relationship with the troubled Post Office, which is owned by the government. The organisation is currently the subject of a long-running inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, where hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing from their accounts. In a statement following his appointment, Mr Railton said: ""This is an incredibly challenging time for the Post Office as it works to address historic failures while also striving to transform its business."" Mr Railton left the former National Lottery operator during a shake-up around the time Allwyn Entertainment acquired Camelot UK. Camelot had run the lottery since the game's launch in 1994, but it faced tough competition and its licence ended in February, with a new one for 10 years being given to Allwyn instead. The new Post Office chairman also chairs Argentex Group, a London-listed provider of currency management services, and is a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation, according to his profile on the social platform LinkedIn. Former chairman Henry Staunton was sacked by Ms Badenoch in January after little more than a year in the role - leading to a bitter public row between the two. After his exit, Mr Staunton claimed in an interview with the Sunday Times that he had been advised by a civil servant to stall compensation payments to allow the government to ""limp into the election"" without the impact of a large pay-out. The government strongly denied the allegation and Ms Badenoch claimed Mr Staunton was under a ""formal investigation"" for ""serious matters such as bullying"". Mr Staunton refuted this. He then disclosed in February that it was actually current chief executive Nick Read who was under investigation after a Speak Up complaint was made against him. The Post Office confirmed at the time there were complaints against Mr Read and other staff, however he has since been cleared of all misconduct allegations following an investigation carried out by an external barrister. The row has been criticised by former sub-postmasters, including campaigner Alan Bates, who described it as a ""sideshow"" to the inquiry.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68928326,business
88,Beijing tightens grip on China social media giants,"New rules that tighten Chinese government restrictions on the country's internet companies have come into effect today, raising concerns about how they will be applied. The expanded State Secrets Law compels firms - including social media giants Tencent, ByteDance and Weibo - to take action if users post sensitive information. It requires ""network operators"" to monitor information being shared by users. The rules also describe how posts should be removed, records saved and reported to authorities. This is the law's first update in more than a decade and is in line with President Xi Jinping's focus on national security as the government cracks down on China's vast technology industry. When the new rules were first announced in February, a National Administration of State Secrets Protection official told the state news agency Xinhua that they were necessary as ""the guarding of state secrets faces new problems and challenges in the new era"". While internet companies in China are already subject to strict rules, the changes ""set a new standard for active self-monitoring and rapid cooperation"", said Hong Kong-based law professor, Ryan Mitchell. The revised rules also broaden the definition of what may be deemed as sensitive information to include ""work secrets"", or information about the decision-making of state agencies, which could be particularly problematic for journalists, including foreign correspondents. ""A main concern for us is the uncertainty as to what really constitutes a 'state secret',"" Jens Eskelund, President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China told the BBC. ""Clear demarcations and definitions would be helpful,"" he added. Taiwan has also voiced concerns about the new rules and said they could place visitors from the island to China at risk. Taipei’s Mainland Affairs Council said the legislation is “highly vague and may cause people to break the law at any time"". The international law firm Baker McKenzie FenXun said that while the definition of what are considered to be state secrets is ""broad and vague"" it should not have a substantial impact on multi-national companies operating in China. The new regulations come as the social media giant TikTok, and its Chinese parent company ByteDance, are facing increased scrutiny in the US and other Western countries. However, the new rules “do not seem to be mainly geared towards regulating the overseas operations of Chinese firms”, Mr Mitchell said.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe8dzz4jdpo,business

Advertising revenue for the first three months of this year was 24% higher year-on-year, with the company making Amazon Prime adverts the default option for many customers over the period. Cloud services and its fastest-ever Prime delivery times also boosted results. Chief executive Andy Jassy said it was “a good start to the year”, although unions and employee groups say the push for delivery speed comes at the expense of staff. Mr Jassy said it was “very early days in all of our businesses” and added he was “excited” about the future. Amazon is one of the world’s largest companies and it initially started as an online shop before moving into other business areas. One of these is online television and film streaming, which comes as an additional benefit of being an Amazon Prime member alongside faster delivery. Adverts in shows and films became the default option for Amazon Prime members in a range of countries, including the US and the UK, in January and February with members needing to pay a fee to turn the adverts off. In the UK, adverts became default on 5 February and the monthly fee to turn them off is £2.99. Meanwhile, the company said it had achieved its “fastest speeds ever” across its delivery services, with 75% of packages in London, Tokyo, and Toronto delivered the same day or the day after. However, unions in the UK and other countries have argued that Amazon’s drive for speed can affect the wellbeing of employees. Amazon does not recognise any UK worker unions, but Unite the union argues that workers need one because of the company’s “break-neck production targets”. In response to union action in the UK, Amazon has previously said that it offers competitive pay and other benefits. Elsewhere in the business, Amazon’s cloud service revenue grew more than analysts had expected, which the company said was due to “AI capabilities reaccelerating its growth rate”. The company’s AI service, Amazon Bedrock, allows users to access AI tools from a range of leading companies. “Tens of thousands of organisations worldwide are using Amazon Bedrock,” Amazon said. Despite growth beating expectations, Amazon’s share price dipped 3% following the results after the company’s sales guidance for the three months to 30 June was less than expected. Amazon predicted revenue would be between $144bn (£115bn) and $149bn, growing between 7% and 11%, but this would be less than the $150bn analysts had forecast.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ez72kn1rlo,business
90,Telegraph up for sale after takeover collapses,"The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are back up for sale after an Abu Dhabi-backed bid to take them over collapsed. The ownership of the papers was set to be transferred to the Gulf-backed RedBird IMI consortium before the government intervened in January. Legislation has since been put forward to ban foreign states from owning UK newspapers and news magazines. RedBird said it would halt the takeover and put the media firm up for sale. The investment firm said its plans were ""no longer feasible"", adding it would now look to secure the ""best value"" for the titles, which include the Spectator magazine. ""We have held constructive conversations with the government about ensuring a smooth and orderly sale for both titles,"" it said in a statement. The Abu-Dhabi-backed deal for the Telegraph was largely funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City Football Club and vice-president and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But concerns were raised by MPs and some of the newspaper's current and former journalists, as well as readers, that the title might fall under control of an authoritarian foreign state. In January, the government intervened to scrutinise the deal and announced last month that foreign governments would be banned from owning UK newspapers and news magazines. The government said the legislation would ""deliver additional protections for a free press"". On Tuesday, RedBird said the consortium's ownership would have seen the ""the strongest editorial protections ever put forward for a UK newspaper, along with much-needed investment."" But it added: ""Under the legislation's definition of foreign power, it will not be possible for RedBird IMI to proceed with its proposed takeover of the Telegraph and Spectator."" The group said its independent directors appointed to run the Telegraph and the Spectator last summer would remain in place until the sale process is completed. Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said she had ""raised concerns about the potential impact of this deal on free expression and accurate presentation of news"". Ms Frazer added she would ""allow the parties to conduct an orderly transition"". Chairman of The Spectator Andrew Neil told the BBC the sales process has put him and the magazine ""in limboland"". ""We've been in limboland for almost a year,"" he said during an interview on the BBC's World At One programme. Asked who might buy the Telegraph and Spectator now RedBird has pulled out, he said: ""Who knows? It's back to the future."" The Telegraph and the Spectator magazine were put up for sale last year when they were seized by Lloyds Banking Group from long-time owners the Barclay family, which had failed to pay back a loan of more than £1bn. Lloyds commenced an auction process, but at the last minute, the Barclay family paid off their debt with money lent by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, and in return, the Barclay family agreed to transfer ownership to the Gulf-backed consortium. RedBird said on Tuesday that it held £600m of debt in the titles. Gulf states have been very significant investors in the UK in recent years. UAE-based investors have poured billions into ports, housing projects, windfarms and science parks and are being courted for an investment in a new nuclear power plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Previous bidders for the Telegraph included hedge fund tycoon Sir Paul Marshall who owns GB News, Daily Mail owners DMGT and Rupert Murdoch's News UK.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68926764,business
91,"'Brexit trade checks will cost me £200,000 a year'","New checks brought in under the UK's Brexit trade agreement will cost one business up to £225,000 a year, its co-owner has said. Meat and dairy products, plants and seeds are among the goods now subject to physical checks when imported to Britain from the European Union from Tuesday. Businesses have warned the trade checks, which will see import costs increase immediately, are expected to hit smaller companies hardest and lead to price rises being passed on to customers for certain products. John Davidson, co-owner of flower company Tom Brown Wholesale, said he expected the checks to cost his business between £200,000 and £225,000 per year. ""Usually we try and absorb as much as we can, but those sorts of costs... [it's] just not possible to absorb everything,"" he said. The second phase of border controls kicked in from midnight and have been introduced as part of the UK's Brexit trade agreement. The government said its new border model would ""improve our biosecurity"", adding the costs for businesses would be ""negligible compared to the impact of a major outbreak of a plant or animal disease"", such as foot and mouth. The UK officially left the EU four years ago, but it has taken some time for the new trade rules to be implemented - legally required under the Brexit agreement - for goods travelling from the bloc to the British Isles. Health certificates were introduced in January on EU goods ranging from cut flowers, to fresh produce including meat, fruit and vegetables, but on Tuesday, physical checks for the goods have come into force. British exporters trading in the other direction have already faced increased red tape for three years. The introduction of such UK border controls is reversing the free flow of such goods, which had been allowed under the EU single market since 1993. The physical checks will be carried out based on the ""risk"" category that goods fall into. For example, the government said high-risk goods, such as live animals, will be subject to identity and physical checks for pests and diseases at the border. Products that present a medium risk to biosecurity will also be checked, while low-risk goods, such as canned meat will not require any checks. The new checks are not yet being applied to goods from the Republic of Ireland, which is a major supplier of food to the UK. The UK government says the checks on Irish goods will not happen before November. But businesses, especially smaller companies, have raised concerns that the new checks could disrupt supply chains and increase costs, with importers having to pay £29 per shipment of particular products. If multiple types of product are being imported by one business, such as meat, fish and cheese, the company will have to pay £29 per category, up to a maximum of £145 per consignment. The government has forecast the charges will cost British firms about £330m per year. Mr Davidson told BBC Breakfast his ""bigger worry"" was how the physical checks would work in practice. ""These products are already checked in Holland. From an industry point of view the communication has really been lacking. ""At the moment Defra (the government department) is saying they are going to use [a] light-touch approach to checking. What does that actually mean? We just want some real clarity on it."" While the checks are coming into force on Tuesday, it is understood the number of them will be very low to start with as traders become accustomed to the new rules. The government has acknowledged that the extra red tape and checks will increase food prices, but not as much as seen in recent times. It has forecast the controls could push up inflation by 0.2 percentage points over three years. But Lucy Neville-Rolfe, minister at the Cabinet Office, said the new checks were essential to improve the UK’s biosecurity. ""We cannot continue with temporary measures which leave the UK open to threats from diseases and could do considerable damage to our livelihoods, our economy and our farming industry,"" she said. On Tuesday, Trade Minister Greg Hands and Exports Minister Lord Garvel were asked about the checks by the Business Select Committee. ""I know there's been frustration expressed on all sides of the equation, but the objective has been to try and minimise the cost and minimise the disruption"", Lord Garvel told the committee. ""When you bring in anything new, of course people are concerned and there is uncertainty, and this is a dynamic situation,"" he added. Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers Union, said the group welcomed the checks ""as a way of safeguarding the nation's food safety"". “British farmers and growers need controls on all imports, not just those from the EU, to be effective, biosecure and efficient. That looks different for the individual sectors in agriculture, dependent on business need,"" he said. Britain imports 22% of its beef, 21% of its sheep meat and 49% of its pork, and relies on the EU for the bulk of those imports, due to consumer demand outstripping supply, according to the British Meat Processors Association. The industry body said with ""so little clear explanation"" of how the new import checks will be rolled out, it had been ""very difficult to gauge the impact on meat supplies, even after four years of preparation"". It said it suspected that larger importers would not be adversely affected, but warned that smaller importers would be. Jamie Collins, of family-run food retailer Hamish Johnston in London, told the BBC his business would probably have to put prices up a bit to maintain its profit margins. ""We import quite a lot of cheese every week from France. Every import we bring over on a weekly basis is looking to get an extra £220 added on to the cost,"" he said. Food price increases have been a major driver of the overall cost of living increasing in the UK in recent years, with food price inflation - the rate at which goods are getting more expensive - at 4% in the year to March. The pace of food price rises has eased in recent months, but the cost of staples such as cheese, bread and milk are much higher than they were in 2020. Martin McTague, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said its members were ""still unsure"" about the trade checks. “They have already been delayed five times so there’s really no excuse not to have communicated what’s going on to small firms,"" he said. He said the ""ripple effect"" of increased costs would lead to businesses having to raise prices, reduce their offering or ""shut up shop entirely"".

92,HSBC chief executive unexpectedly steps down,"HSBC's group chief executive Noel Quinn is unexpectedly retiring after nearly five years in the role. Europe's largest bank says it is in the process of finding a successor for 62-year-old Mr Quinn, who will stay in the role until a new chief executive is named. HSBC is considering candidates from both inside and outside the firm. It comes as the UK-based lender reported a 1.8% drop in profit for the first three months of 2024, compared to the same time last year. The company said that its pre-tax profit for the period came in at $12.7bn (£10bn), which was a little better than expected by market analysts. ""After an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life,” Mr Quinn said. Mr Quinn, who has worked at HSBC for 37 years, was first appointed as its chief executive on an interim basis in 2019, after his predecessor John Flint was ousted from the role. In March 2020, he took the reins of HSBC on a permanent basis. ""[Mr Quinn] has driven both our transformation strategy and created a simpler, more focused business that delivers higher returns,"" HSBC's chairman Mark Tucker said. Along with its quarterly results, the bank announced an interim payout to investors of $0.10 per share and said it would buy back up to $3bn of its shares. HSBC recently completed the sale of its operations in Canada and announced plans to do the same with its business in Argentina. The sales are part of efforts by the London-based bank to focus more on faster-growing markets in Asia. Shanti Kelemen, chief investment office at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme that it ""has probably been a very intense five years"" and that Mr Quinn ""has had a very long career"". She said that Mr Quinn had changed the shape of the bank during his time at the top, by such actions as selling HSBC's Argentina business, leaving Canada, and stepping up Asia operations. ""What he's done will probably reverberate and determine the path of their success for certainly several years to come,"" she added.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czkvnd4g44ro,business
93,Migrants hit by high fees to send money home,"Jerry Lukendo Mbokani has to make several calculations when he sends money to his elderly mother in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Kampala, Uganda, where Mr Mbokani has lived for 16 years, he first has to buy US dollars. To convert approximately $100 (£80) worth of Ugandan shillings would cost almost $3, he reports. He also adds the withdrawal fee of $7, so that his mother doesn't incur a fee when receiving the money. He sends these remittances through mobile money, usually phone-based digital transfers, rather than through a physical location like a bank, post office, or Western Union-style money transfer company. In real terms 10% of the amount could be eaten up in fees. Mr Mbokani, the chief executive of the Refugee-Led Organization Network (Relon), knows he's far from alone. One target of the UN Sustainable Development Goals is that by 2030, remittance fees should be less than 3%, and total fees to send and receive money between a pair of countries should be no more than 5%. Some researchers believe that to be truly affordable, the first goal should be even less than 3%. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that reaching this target could generate $32bn (£26bn), even apart from the direct-cost savings. This is because remittances have such powerful knock-on effects for the economy, and people tend to send more in remittances when fees are lower. Yet the world is far off this target. According to the World Bank , the global average is 6.2%, over double the target. It's especially pricey to send money to sub-Saharan Africa, where the average transaction fee is 7.4%. For particular combinations of countries, fee percentages can climb well into the double digits. One reason for high fees is inconsistent regulation. Within Africa a payment company can't use a single licence across multiple countries, says Nika Naghavi. She is the group head of growth at Onafriq, a digital payment network that extends through more than 40 African countries. A result is that even between neighbouring countries with a robust trade and frequent population movement, money can't always flow freely. For instance, Ms Naghavi says, transfers between Togo and Benin are frequent and straightforward, helped by having a common currency. Yet money can't easily be sent between Togo and another neighbour country, Ghana. ""That's why the costs become heavy: a lot of it is in compliance and regulation,"" says Ms Naghavi. More technology of business These requirements may not be so applicable to low-value transfers. Sending $50 to a relative in another country is not very risky, but may still fall under a complicated chain of regulations meant to safeguard against money laundering. In some countries, ""the regulations governing who can act as a remittance provider can be quite stifling,"" says Ravenna Sohst, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute Europe. ""For young companies to enter into this market requires a lot of technical, financial and legal knowhow, which I think is one of the reasons why the field has seen relatively few players for a long time."" Ms Sohst says that Mexico-US is an example of a major remittance corridor, where more competition has helped reduce prices. Without competition, rates can be set by the few companies (or informal, cash-based agents) able to facilitate transfers between a pair of countries. Limited competition also means that companies may not feel the need to disclose much information about fees. ""It's up to sometimes the service providers what they want to show to the customer,"" says Uloma Ogba, a gender and learning specialist for the Migration and Remittances Program of the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). This can include misleading claims about zero-fee transactions, which ""often means that the service provider and other agents involved along that transaction process are making money some other way"". ""Our North Star should be to ensure that these customer fees are as close as possible to zero,"" Ms Naghavi says. ""But today it's not possible because of the underlying cost of running your business."" Companies may temporarily lower or eliminate transaction fees during disasters, as occurred immediately after the 2023 earthquake in Morocco. But emergency expenses crop up at other times as well. Female migrants, especially, are sending money home to cover unseen expenses. In Ms Ogba's own monthly remittances from the US to Nigeria, she prioritises her parents' healthcare, her cousin's education, and communal obligations like funeral expenses. On top of this are contributions for home renovations. Flexible pricing structures would be particularly helpful for women. They typically earn lower incomes than men and often send smaller, more frequent remittances for things like healthcare and education, Ms Ogba says. Because digital remittances are more affordable than traditional banking (with average fees of 4.8% vs. 6.2% respectively), and because they can require less documentation, much of the innovation is occurring in the digital realm. For instance, a fintech company catering to Gambian migrants in the UK found that its customers wanted to be able to directly pay utility bills for their families in Gambia. It's impossible to talk about digital innovation in sending money without mentioning cryptocurrency. Some enthusiasts believe that Bitcoin and other types of crypto promise more seamless transfers of money anywhere in the world. However, volatility, patchy regulation and limited knowledge remain barriers to uptake of cryptocurrency for remittances. Even more basic technologies can be out of reach for people sending and receiving remittances. While it's cheaper to send mobile money, many of the poorest people in the world lack mobile phones and internet access. While at least half of remittances are now digital , cash remittances dominate in low-and middle-income countries. It can also be especially difficult for people on the move, or those unable to obtain official forms of identification, to provide tax ID numbers and other documentation. In Uganda, Mr Mbokani says, refugee ID cards aren't part of the same centralised register as national IDs. And there can be obstacles to using refugee IDs at some money transfer agencies. Such issues mean that ""we're leaving a lot of people behind,"" Ms Naghavi comments.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68817110,business
94,Vinted makes first profit on used fashion,"Vinted has made a profit for the first time as the fashion for second-hand clothes remains on trend. It was a firm ""at the forefront of a market with huge potential"", its chief executive said. Digital platforms allowing customers to sell their ""pre-loved"" items direct to other people have taken off in recent years. But Vinted, which has expanded rapidly across Europe, is the first out of the red, turning a €20.4m (£17.4m) loss in 2022 into a €17.8m profit. Thomas Plantenga, Vinted's chief executive, said second-hand fashion remained a ""tiny"" proportion of the market but that the firm was in a strong position. As well as expanding into new markets, including Denmark, Finland and Romania, Vinted had also accelerated the development of its delivery service Vinted Go, he said. “We see many opportunities ahead, so we’ll continue to balance profitability against investment opportunities to accelerate towards our mission,” Mr Plantenga said. He added that enabling customers to sell to each other would help ""mitigate the harm of the fashion industry"". Vinted said revenues had jumped 61% to €596.3m (£509m) in 2023 compared with the previous year. The marketplace acquired a second-hand designer clothes specialist platform, Rebelle in 2022 and has launched a service which verifies the authenticity of valuable items. Vinted and a similar UK-based platform Depop have both caught on with British shoppers in recent years, eating into eBay's original dominance of the second-hand clothing market, and appealing particularly to younger shoppers. The cost-of-living crisis, combined with increased awareness of fashion's environmental impact, have helped bolster the trend. Social media influencers and celebrities have also helped to overhaul associations with musty, out-of-fashion, charity shop stock. A recent report from US-based second-hand retailer ThredUp suggests that the market for used fashion is now worth tens of billions of dollars a year in Asia, North America and Europe. However the size of the new clothes market, and the trend towards lower quality ""fast fashion"" products, mean it is hard for second-hand platforms to make a profit. ""In recent years, the likes of Vinted and Depop have ploughed millions into growing their headcount and expanding their audience, as they looked to capitalise on the second-hand trend,"" said retail analyst Natalie Berg. ""It’s a gamble that seems to have paid off for Vinted. With low prices and no seller fees, its model needs scale which, in turn, will open up alternative revenue streams like advertising."" Vinted, a privately owned firm, said it had expanded its staff by a third. It now has 2,000 employees, most of them in Lithuania.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxwvp2z7djyo,business
95,'Temu is as addictive as sugar': How the ecommerce retailer drives a shopping frenzy,"With flash deals, gamificiation and rock-bottom prices, shoppers are finding Temu nearly impossible to resist. When Manchester-based Lucy Clark first logged on to the viral retail app Temu in 2023, she felt like she was in a virtual casino. A spinning roulette wheel touted tantalising cash coupon rewards; countdown timers – precariously close to running out – promised free delivery; and lightning bolts advertising flash discount deals streaked across her screen. ""I'd heard about Temu on TikTok, with people showing off their hauls and sharing promotional codes,"" says the 27-year-old marketing director. ""Everyone I know has at least been on Temu [once] and had a look. I wasn't searching for anything in particular."" Barraged with a bewildering array of dirt-cheap home gadgets, electronic devices and novelty items, Clark decided to buy some squeaky dog toys for Rickson, her mother's French Bulldog. They cost a fraction of the price she'd pay at retail stores like Pets at Home or even online at Amazon. She was unfazed by Temu's two-week delivery window – glacial by Amazon's standards, but realistic according to her experience with Shein, where Clark has shopped for several years. ""I could pay extra to get it expedited,"" says Clark, ""but I'm never that desperate for the stuff I'm ordering."" Temu's eclectic emporium of stuff is just that – rarely are they necessities, but the scrapyard symphony has something for everyone. If you've imagined it – and perhaps even if you haven't – Temu has it: from beard-trimming bibs to mini toilet golf, tiny printers, avocado slicers or swanky hoodies for your car's gear stick. Clark knows quality isn't guaranteed, but she writes that off as just a part of the shopping experience. ""You're either going to get something really good and an absolute bargain. Or you get something that's a bit naff, but won't actually return it, because it's less than £10 so it's not worth your time,"" she says. Temu's approach to pricing and how it promotes products, say experts, is deliberate – pushing the exact consumer psychology buttons necessary to keep shoppers shopping. And ""gamification"" – the practice of implementing gaming-related elements into the ecommerce experience – is increasingly common. Customers are encouraged to keep shopping with the introduction of bonuses and coupons that mimic the rewards you might accumulate in a video game. Now, brands worldwide are attempting to cash in on this phenomenon, incorporating spin to win features, quizzes and elabourate referral systems on their sites. Even iconic brands such as Starbucks and Sephora have added gamified elements to their online reward programmes; Lacoste has a crocodile hunt game in which shoppers unlock prizes in its virtual store. Few brands, however, do all these things simultaneously and as conspicuously as Temu. The billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform is designed to get consumers' brains firing on all cylinders, and stoke the frenzied shopping for which they're now famous. What is Temu's secret – and does its formula set the stage for the future of shopping? ""Temu is as addictive as sugar,"" says retail analyst Neil Saunders. ""The experience and cheap prices give consumers a little dopamine hit and keeps them coming back for more."" Regular promotions increase engagement, he adds, and the chaotic interface of the website creates the illusion for consumers that they can ""dive in"" and rummage around to discover a great deal – especially finding them if they move quickly. Mark Griffiths , professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University, UK, agrees. ""They've mixed shopping and gamification really well. Temu's marketing strategy means you are literally having to browse to get your rewards."" He explains that Temu utilises the ""perceived urgency aspect"" by using timers and countdowns to convince customers that deals are running out. He likens it to the strategy behind slot machines, where the sounds associated with button pushing heighten arousal levels. Temu has even carved a space separate from brands such as Shein, even though the two are often compared, as ultra-fast fashion brands are known for eye-wateringingly low prices. While both are often in the headlines for competitive rivalries , Temu takes gamification one step further. ""Temu often employs a combination of social proof, scarcity and frequently uses animated elements to capture consumers' attention, more so than Shein and Wish,"" explains Vilma Todri , an associate professor of Information Systems at Goizueta Business School at Emory University, US, who researches the impact of Internet-related technologies on consumer behaviour and previously worked at Google. The retailer also relies heavily on social proof as ""a highly effective persuasive technique,"" adds Todri. If something catches your eye, there's a slew of ways Temu keeps you engaged with the product. A shopper may see a product's review and number of five-star ratings, how many people purchased it in the past 24 hours and the number of customers who currently have the product in their carts. All this, explains Todri, provides evidence of the product's supposed quality and popularity, psychologically tapping in to our desire to conform or join in. Some users claim Temu's tactics work so well, they've become addicted to the sales platform. Griffiths is sceptical of the claim. Barring a small minority of individuals with the propensity to spend more than 10 hours shopping online each day, he believes it is unlikely Temu alone could be an all-consuming addiction in the clinical sense of the word . Still, the gaming elements could drive consumers to part with their money unwisely. ""I don't think people would spend all day, every day on Temu... but like gambling, shopping is a commercial activity and even if you're not spending great amounts of time, you might be going beyond your disposable income,"" he says. Addiction or not, a steady drip-feed of these marketing tactics can have a lasting effect. Luring consumers with the promise of free gifts, ""[Temu] then kind of takes you down a spiral"", says Griffiths, and many consumers share anecdotally there always seems to be one last hurdle before the promised reward, such as referring more friends. If consumers are so drawn to these types of marketing approaches, other brands may be tempted to adopt them, too – or even feel like they have no choice if they want to compete with the behemoth that is Temu. Yet even if they do take a similar approach – integrating gamified shopping and rock-bottom prices – it doesn't guarantee success. In fact, say experts, Temu may be impossible to compete with, mostly due to its business model. First, Temu is able to offer such low prices because they're betting on a long-term strategy of operating at a loss in order to scale to the point that they squeeze out nearly all competition. Elizabeth Clark, cofounder and CEO at Dream AI ltd, a UK-based AI company that specialises in ecommerce is already seeing the threat of Temu play out in the UK market . ""You can't compete on price with Temu. It's a tremendous business case. They've not had to put money into the logistics or the manufacturers. [It's] a poor man's, accelerated version of Shein and Amazon,"" says Clark – who is also the mum of Temu shopper Lucy. (Elizabeth was ""appalled"" when she discovered her daughter was getting toys for ""her precious Frenchie"" from the retailer.) Therefore, for smaller brands, Temu's aggressive growth strategies and ultra-low prices are impossible to emulate, she says. Clark has been sounding the alarm bell, and sees her clients struggle when confronted with the ecommerce giant first hand. ""At the start of last year, Temu was kind of nowhere in the US, but by the end, certain companies couldn't even buy products at the price Temu was selling them,"" she says. More like this: Yet for all Temu's power, the company is not impenetrable. Despite being just more than a year old, Temu is already under regulators' lenses for data breaches and exploiting trade loopholes , such as the De Minimis Value threshold in the US, in which orders valued less than $800 (£642) are exempt from duty. There have also been a spate of new probes into the ethics of its business model, and Temu consistently battles serious allegations of slave labour as US lawmakers warn the website may sell forced labour goods . Now, its sheer growth in Europe (at 75 million users in the EU, it surpasses the threshold of 45 million users that makes it a VLOP – very large online platform – according to EU regulations ) means it will likely face more stringent monitoring , even as the sheer number of the site's offerings make consistent review difficult in practice. In the US, efforts to regulate Temu's handling of data has bred calls from lawmakers to investigate or ban the app outright. And although Temu's interface may seem irresistible, Todri thinks that over time, consumers may tire or become wary of the company's relentless gamified approach. ""As consumers become more accustomed to the marketing and business strategies Temu utilises, they might become more sceptical."" But we're not there yet. For Lucy Clark, Temu is still appealing. Despite what she and her mother describe as ""the horrific smell of chemicals"" coming from the dog toys she purcahsed, Rickson loves them. Some have fallen apart – but, says Lucy, in Temu's defence the higher-priced versions would have met a similar fate, anyway. It's why she finds herself continuing to patronise Temu. Simply, she says, the price is right.

96,Elon Musk in China to discuss enabling Full Self Driving,"Elon Musk is visiting Beijing with media reports saying he aims to discuss enabling autonomous driving mode on Tesla cars in China. Mr Musk wants to enable Full Self Driving (FSD) in China and transfer data collected in the country abroad to train its algorithms. FSD is available in countries including the US but not in China. The news came after a US report tied Tesla's autonomous driving modes to at least 13 crashes, involving one death. During a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Mr Musk was quoted by state media as saying Tesla was willing deep cooperation with China to ""achieve more win-win results"". In response, Mr Li told Mr Musk the Chinese market would ""always be open to foreign-funded firms,"" according to the reports. China is Tesla's second-biggest market. Other carmakers such as Xpeng - headquartered in Guangzhou - have been attempting to compete with Tesla by rolling out similar self-driving functions in their cars. On Sunday, Mr Musk described Chinese car manufacturers as ""the most competitive car companies in the world"". Tesla has previously taken steps to reassure Chinese authorities about the rollout of FSD in the country, including establishing a data centre in Shanghai to process data about Chinese consumers in accordance with local laws. The trip comes days after the US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was investigating whether a recall successfully addressed safety concerns relating to Tesla's driver assistance system. The NHTSA said that despite requirements that drivers maintain focus on the road and be prepared to take control at a moment's notice when autonomous driving was enabled, drivers involved in the crashes ""were not sufficiently engaged"". The regulator's analysis was conducted before a recall Tesla said would fix the issue. Tesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention and that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving on highways. Mr Musk has promised that Teslas will be able to act as autonomous ""robotaxis"" for years. In 2015, he said Teslas would achieve ""full autonomy"" by 2018. And in 2019, he said the company would have robotaxis operating by the following year. This month, the Tesla chief executive said he would reveal the company's robotaxi in August. Critics accuse Mr Musk of consistently hyping up the prospects of full autonomous driving to prop up the company's share price, which has fallen on the back of challenges including falling demand for electric vehicles worldwide and competition from cheaper Chinese manufacturers. Mr Musk denies the accusations. Tesla has been cutting the prices of its cars in China and other markets to drum up demand. ""Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand,"" Mr Musk recently said on X, the microblogging platform previously known as Twitter which the billionaire owns. Tesla recently reported a 13% fall in automotive sales to $17.3bn (£13.7bn) for the first three months of this year. Overall sales across Tesla dropped by 9% while its profits fell sharply to $1.13bn compared to $2.51bn for the same period last year. So far in 2024, its share price has collapsed by 32%.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68914929,business
97,Boeing: Dead whistleblower warned of safety breaches,"A former Boeing employee, who was found dead in March, accused the company of ""countless"" violations of US law in testimony given just before his death. John Barnett claimed the firm tried to ""eliminate"" quality inspections at a plant that makes 787 planes. The former quality control manager had been giving a formal legal deposition against the plane manufacturer. The 62-year-old's death after two days of testimony was from a ""self-inflicted gunshot wound"", officials said. Boeing says it was ""saddened"" by Mr Barnett's death, but said the issues he raised had been reviewed and addressed. The aerospace giant's safety standards are currently under the spotlight, in part due to an incident in January when a disused door fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off. The transcript of Mr Barnett's deposition has now been released by his lawyers. The lengthy document runs to more than 140 pages. Mr Barnett had worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before his retirement on health grounds in 2017. He subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he had suffered retaliation from managers after raising a number of serious safety concerns, a charge the company denies. The bulk of Mr Barnett's deposition focuses on the period from 2010 onwards, after he had moved from Boeing's facility in Everett, Washington to what was then a brand-new factory in North Charleston. The plant had been set up to help assemble the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes. Mr Barnett had previously told the BBC and others that managers there had routinely ignored formal procedures in order to build planes as quickly as possible. In his deposition, he provided more detail on these allegations, in support of his legal complaint that he had been ""denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn"" by senior managers, who had subjected him to a gaslighting campaign, and created a ""hostile work environment"" as a result of his actions. A key part of his testimony focused on the alleged falsification of records relating to problems within the production process and in particular the logging of defective or substandard parts. He claimed employees had been under pressure to circumvent established procedures, set out in Boeing's own Quality Management System, to save time. A common theme within the factory, he said, was: ""We don't have time to follow processes, we're building airplanes"". This, he said, had allowed ""an awful lot"" of faulty parts onto the production line, while others had simply been lost. These included two large sections of aircraft fuselage, which ""weren't anywhere to be found"". In one specific instance, he claimed a contaminated and faulty tube designed to work in an oxygen system had been removed from a scrap bin and might have been installed on an aircraft that was now in service. Such parts normally had to be carefully sterilised to reduce the risk of unwanted chemical reactions. Without that, he said, there was a risk that if the system was activated, it could cause an explosion that would ""bring the whole plane down"". He suggested that there had been ""countless"" occasions on which paperwork had been falsified, and agreed with his lawyer's suggestion that each violation of procedure amounted to a ""criminal offense and felony"". Mr Barnett was also deeply critical of what he saw as a drive at the South Carolina plant to reduce quality control inspections, again to speed up the manufacturing process. ""So the push for probably the last 15 to 20 years at Boeing is to eliminate quality [inspections]"", he said. ""But when here in Charleston they put that push on steroids"". Boeing's own lawyers focused more on Mr Barnett's claims that he had been retaliated against, and appeared to question his assertion that his safety concerns had not been taken seriously at the time. In a statement given to the BBC, Boeing said: ""We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing and our thoughts continue to be with his family and friends. ""Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety"". It also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law. It added: ""We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously. ""To ensure the safety, quality and conformance of our products, we investigate all allegations of improper behaviour. We then work diligently to address them and make improvements."" Mr Barnett's lawsuit is expected to continue. It will be taken forward by his mother Vicky Stokes and his brother Rodney Barnett as representatives of his estate. The case is now expected to go to trial in September.",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/68907597,business
98,Formula E: The world's fastest electric vehicles could spark widespread innovation,"The common electric vehicle doesn't need to hit lightning speed – but Formula E race cars could usher in a new era for all. When Formula E's Season 10 kicked off at Mexico City's Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in January, the roar of 40,000 spectators easily drowned out the mosquito whine of the 24 all-electric race cars zipping off the starting grid. Hurtling along at speeds upwards of 300km/h (186mph), some of the best drivers in the world jockeyed for position along the circuit. Dreamed up in 2011 on the back of a napkin at a Paris restaurant, Formula E is now a decade old. It has 11 teams, with 22 drivers total, operating single-seater race cars similar in appearance to the famed open-cockpit vehicles of Formula One. ""The standard of driving is very high,"" says Graham Evans, director of auto supply chain and technology for S&P Global Mobility, an automotive intelligence firm. ""These are very good guys who are also very experienced professional drivers."" Since its first season in 2014, Formula E has grown into a lucrative business. Intelligence company GlobalData estimates the championship's total sponsorship for the 2023-2024 season at $102.5m (£81.36m) , with international viewership and attendance estimated at 344 million worldwide in 2023 . The batteries in the current generation of Formula E cars deliver up to 350kW of power, and can propel a driver to a maximum top speed of 320km/h (199mph), approaching the top speed of traditional F1 cars. And while the racing series may not have the pedigree – or budget – of F1, it does provide a unique and important testing ground for new battery technology that could benefit the entire EV industry. The competition among engineering firms to design batteries for Formula E is fierce, says Ashley Nunes , an associate and researcher at Harvard University's department of economics, who studies the electric vehicle market. Only a handful of elite companies can build these batteries to the specifications required to compete in a world-renowned race. The companies who've won bids include WAE, McLaren, Podium Advanced Technologies and Atieva, the technology arm of luxury EV brand Lucid Motors. Most of these companies already have a pedigree of building high-performance tech, including batteries, for the biggest internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered racing series in the world, Formula 1. While designing this technology may bring in more revenue for these companies in the short term, there's plenty of money to be made in engineering battery technology for Formula E. The technology is far more expensive than the batteries found in a typical road EV, and for good reason. A Tesla Model S going all-out on a racetrack will start slowing down as the battery charge gets depleted , says Evans. That's because the battery isn't capable of handling sustained race performance. By contrast, any petrol or diesel-powered car can stay at top speed even on a quarter of a tank. A Formula E battery needs to behave more like its ICE kin at all times. ""It's got to deliver sustained high performance,"" says Evans. On top of offering enough power for incredible bursts of speed, a Formula E battery needs to remain as light as possible. Race regulations require it to weigh just 284kg (626lbs), roughly a third of the car's total weight including the driver, and be capable of ultra-fast charging during a race. Plus, batteries get hot when overused, so they need an elaborate cooling system. All those requirements create tremendous engineering challenges (and capital requirements) for whichever company is tapped to build a Formula E battery. ""The margins are probably relatively small, but because there aren't many producers, you can charge a premium for them,"" says Evans. According to the Fédération Internationale De L'Automobile (Fia) – the regulatory body for both Formula 1 and Formula E – the GEN3 battery system's total cost for Formula E's 2022-2023 season was €264,812 ($268,000; £226,442). ""The people who are paying that price are multi-billion-dollar companies like Mercedes and Ferrari,"" says Nunes."" They have deep pockets."" Formula E battery suppliers don't just earn money from the batteries themselves. The process of developing new battery pack configurations, cooling systems and fast-recharge techniques can all be patented. If a Formula E supplier creates a revolutionary new technology for the track, says Evans, and licenses it to a mainstream EV automaker building millions of units a year, the licensing fee alone could be well worth the investment. More like this: Plenty of innovations for everyday cars, like tire pressure gauges , had their origins in F1. But Nunes points out that the battery requirements for road EVs are very different from their ultra-competitive cousins. Drivers want high range, large capacity and longevity that simply aren't necessary for Formula E, whose batteries don't need to last for a decade or more of driving. Experts are already watching some new battery developments. One is fast charging. Formula E vehicles use ultra-fast DC charging to reach top speeds, while passenger EV's use a slower AC charge that provides greater range. Still, many automakers in the commercial EV industry are keen to gain insight into Formula E charging technology as it rapidly evolves. To Evans, the biggest innovation might come through immersion cooling, a system where Formula E batteries are immersed in a refrigerant called dielectric fluid. The result is a significantly cooler battery capable of long-lasting high performance. Combined with ultra-fast charging, he says the racetrack can serve as an incubator for EV development overall. ""In terms of being able to deliver that really high-powered challenge, Formula E can help us understand the art of the possible,"" says Evans. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240417-formula-e-the-worlds-fastest-electric-vehicles-could-spark-widespread-innovation,business
99,Why green steam is a hot issue for business,"Colorado-based New Belgium Brewing can trace its roots to 1988 and a cycle trip through Belgium. The experience inspired co-founders Kim Jordan and Jeff Lebesch to bring Belgian brewing techniques back to their home town. Three years later and the duo were selling Fat Tire, one of their first beers at a local festival, and they now have over a dozen beers in production. But while they have spent 30 years creating flavours unique to the US market, they have at least one thing in common with all brewers - the use of steam. Steam is used to sanitise their brewing equipment, as well as being a key part of the brewing process. Large cone-shaped kettles are used to boil wort - liquid extracted from the initial brewing stage of mashing barley - generating steam. This boiling process helps to remove flavours the brewer does not want in the beer, before the wort is transferred to vessels to ferment with yeast, resulting in beer. Some of the steam generated by the kettles is captured by a heat exchanger, which allows the brewer to use this waste heat in the next batch of brewing. The driving force behind the industrial revolution, steam remains crucial to production processes across multiple industries. As well as its frequent use in the food and beverage industry, steam is also used for sterilisation by pharmaceutical companies, and for heating a wide range of buildings such as hospitals. But steam is still primarily generated using boilers run on fossil fuels, giving it a big carbon footprint. Fossil fuels made up 73% of industrial energy use in the US in 2018, with 40% of these fossil fuels used to heat boilers producing steam. To cut that, one option would be to switch to electric. Assuming the electricity is generated from sustainable sources, then the carbon footprint is slashed. But using electricity does have downsides. ""The biggest challenge is cost, which is likely to limit the pace of customer adoption,"" says Maurizio Preziosa, from UK-based engineering firm Spirax Group. While cost might be an issue, the switch is relatively straightforward. Mr Preziosa says that his firm's technology can usually slot into the existing system. ""Customers can continue to use the rest of their existing steam infrastructure,"" Mr Preziosa explains. This has the additional benefit of reducing downtime, a potential obstacle to adoption for companies reliant on tightly calibrated production processes. US-based AtmosZero has a different approach to creating steam. Their boiler is a heat pump, which extracts heat from the air and turns it into high temperature steam. It works by circulating liquid refrigerants with low boiling points through a closed loop, capturing warmth from the air. The slightly warmed refrigerant is compressed, raising it to a temperature high enough to boil water. A heat exchanger then transfers that heat from the refrigerant, to water to make steam. The big advantage of this approach is that it cuts operating costs. The company's chief executive, Addison Stark estimates that their heat pump technology could save companies hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to the options currently available. ""Being a heat pump-based system, we are significantly more efficient than current boilers - we create about two units of heat output for one unit of energy input, dramatically reducing the operating costs,"" Mr Stark explains. More technology of business AtmosZero is still in the early stages, with more development work needed. The goal is to build a manufacturing plant and start delivering boiler systems in early 2026. Mr Stark is confident the system will work at the scale needed by industry. ""We are mass-manufactured and simple to deploy."" Makers of green steam equipment see demand rising in the coming years. ""The expectations of end consumers are shifting,"" Maurizio Preziosa from Spirax Group explains. ""They want to buy from companies who operate sustainably by reducing their impact on people and planet, and this, along with regulatory pressure, is driving demand from our customers who serve those consumers,"" he says. Back in Colorado, preparations are under way at New Belgium Brewing where AtmosZero will be swapping out one of the brewery's combustion boilers for their heat pump system. This is the next step on a journey of sustainability the company has been on since those early days selling their beer at local festivals. As well as installing solar panels and creating electricity from wastewater, Fat Tire, one of their first beers, became the first certified carbon neutral beer in America in August 2020. This is part of a wider company ambition to become completely carbon neutral by 2030. Changing the way they use steam may just be the key step towards this goal.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68687140,business
100,The ex-flight attendant who became the first female boss of Japan Airlines,"When Mitsuko Tottori was named as the new boss of Japan Airlines (JAL) in January, it sent a shockwave across the country's corporate sector. Not only was Ms Tottori the carrier's first female boss, she had also started her career as a member of cabin crew. The headlines ranged from ""first woman"" and ""first former flight attendant"" to ""unusual"" and ""no way!"" One website even described her as ""an alien molecule"" or ""a mutant"", a reference to her having worked at Japan Air System (JAS), a much smaller airline that JAL bought two decades ago. ""I didn't know about an alien mutant,"" Ms Tottori  laughs as she spoke to me from Tokyo. In short, she was not from the elite group of businessmen that the carrier had customarily appointed to its top job. Out of the last 10 men who held the post, seven were educated at the country's top university. Ms Tottori is a graduate of a far less prestigious women-only junior college. With Ms Tottori's appointment, JAL has joined the less than 1% of Japan's top companies led by women. ""I don't think of myself as the first woman or the first former flight attendant. I want to act as an individual so I didn't expect to get this much attention."" ""But I realise the public or our employees don't necessarily see me like that,"" she adds. Her appointment also came just two weeks after JAL's flight attendants were lauded for the successful evacuation of passengers from a plane that collided with a coast guard aircraft during landing. Japan Airlines Flight 516 burst into flames after the collision on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Five of the six crew on the coastguard plane died and captain was injured. However, within minutes of the collision, all 379 people on board the Airbus A350-900 had safely escaped. The rigorous training of the carrier's flight attendants was suddenly in the spotlight. As a former flight attendant herself, Ms Tottori learned the importance of aviation safety first hand. Four months after she became a flight attendant in 1985, Japan Airlines was involved in the deadliest single aircraft accident in aviation history, which killed 520 people on Mount Osutaka. ""Every member of staff at JAL is given an opportunity to climb Mount Osutaka and speak to those who remember the accident,"" Ms Tottori says. ""We also exhibit aircraft debris at our safety promotion centre so instead of just reading about it in a book, we look with our own eyes and feel with our own skin to learn about the accident."" While her appointment in the top job came as a surprise, JAL has changed rapidly since it went bankrupt in 2010, in what was the country's biggest ever corporate failure outside the financial sector. The airline managed to continue flying thanks to major state-backed financial support and the business underwent a sweeping restructuring with a new board and management. Its saviour was then-77-year-old retiree and ordained Buddhist monk, Kazuo Inamori. Without his transformational influence it is unlikely that someone like Ms Tottori could have become JAL's leader. I spoke to him in an interview in 2012 . He did not mince his words, saying JAL was an arrogant firm that did not care about its customers. Under Mr Inamori's leadership the company promoted people from frontline operations, like pilots and engineers, rather than from bureaucratic posts. ""I felt very uncomfortable because the company didn't feel like a private firm at all,"" Mr Inamori, who died in 2022, told me. ""Many former government officials used to get golden parachutes into the firm."" JAL has come a long way since then, and the attention its first female president is receiving is not surprising. The Japanese government has been trying for almost a decade to increase the number of female bosses in the country. It now wants a third of leadership positions at major businesses to go to women by 2030, after failing to achieve the goal by 2020 . ""It is not just about the corporate leaders' mindset, but it is also important for women to have the confidence to become a manager,"" says Ms Tottori. ""I hope my appointment would encourage other women to try things that they were afraid of trying before.""",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68823400,business
101,A US TikTok ban could take a bite out of small businesses,"Without the popular social media platform, some creators and small enterprises across the globe could see their revenue plummet. On 24 April, the US Senate passed legislation to ban TikTok, the popular social media app . Hours later, President Biden signed the bill into law. It requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell the app to non-Chinese owners or face a blanket ban in the US. The decision now faces a complicated and uphill legal battle. Many devoted fans of the social media platform in the US – more than 150 million users – may see their favourite leisure activity disappear. Yet some of the people who stand to feel most impacted are the creators and small businesses on TikTok that make money through the platform, whether on the side or full-time. According to March 2024 data from TikTok, more than seven million small US businesses use TikTok, and the company reported it drove $15bn (£12.04bn) in revenue for these enterprises in 2023. The platform is also a major global economic force: in January, TikTok reported small- and medium-sized enterprises on the platform contributed €4.8bn ($5.14bn; £4.12bn) to the GDP of Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands and Belgium in 2023 alone. Now, facing a TikTok ban, American entrepreneurs are worried about their revenue streams. So too are global businesses that rely on US audiences to buy their products and engage with their content. There may be alternatives, but finding a suitable substitute could be an uphill battle. Shira, 27, who has more than 500,000 followers on the platform at @shirashiraonthewall, is a full-time content creator. She launched her account on TikTok in 2021 after she moved to the US from Australia. Initially, she shared reaction videos to other people's content as well as her experiences living in the US. Within nine months, her following had ballooned. To generate income, Shira relies on partnerships on TikTok. While she also has accounts on Snapchat and YouTube, she says TikTok has consistently brought in the most money. She's put in a lot of work, she tells the BBC. ""I have spent many years growing and developing a really dedicated audience. Doing many live streams, posting and editing for years. It's been a difficult journey to make any money from it, so I'm really grateful I took the leap and got lucky."" Shira describes the ban as ""devastating"". Beyond her own business, she says she's also concerned about potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs that will be lost – in March, TikTok reported the app provides at least 224,000 jobs in the US. ""I'm not sure what all these people are going to do if the ban goes through,"" says Shira. ""There is no unemployment for creators or fallbacks."" Ileana Justine, 30, a creator with a following of nearly 200,000 on TikTok at @ileanajustine, expresses similar concerns. Her account took off in 2021 after she began posting about the fact that she and her groom were requiring guests to wear masks at their upcoming wedding to help limit the spread of Covid-19. She was soon launched into the realm occupied by ""controversial"" content creators, and since then she's ""primarily focused on the intersection of lifestyle and political content"", discussing topics such as paid family leave, abortion and gun control. Unlike Shira, Ileana isn't a full-time content creator, but her work on the platform still takes time. Beyond her own economics, she's also concerned for people whose income is entirely based on TikTok success. ""The platform allows for amplification of their products and stores, which can completely transform their businesses – I have lots of friends who have been able to turn their businesses from side hustles into full-time jobs because of TikTok."" The ban may not spell doom for businesses – but experts say it will force them to adapt, much of which will be figuring out how to shift their operations to other online platforms. ""We're living in a digital economy … and we're basically relying on technology for all kinds of communication and information,"" says Mohammad Rahman , a professor of management at the Purdue University Daniels School of Business, US. The idea of going back to how business was done before social media likely won't work, primarily because ""consumers [around the world] have changed in terms of how we collect information, how we decide on what to buy"". If TikTok is banned in the US, there are existing alternatives such as Meta, and experts predict others could pop up in the future. There's also time for businesses to figure out their next moves; ByteDance will have at least 270 days to sell TikTok from the point of President Biden's approval, a period that may extend further due to by court battles between the ByteDance and the US government. Yet which platform they might migrate to in the wake of a ban is anyone's guess, says Kristen Schiele , an associate professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California's Marshall Business School, especially since many are laser focused on reaching Gen Z, who drive a large portion of spending on TikTok . ""It's hard to reach them on any other platform,"" she says. American TikTok users don't just power domestic businesess – they have a global impact. Entrepreneurs in other countries stand to potentially lose the US audiences they depend on for views that ultimately convert to sales, too. Some have already expressed concerns, including within the UK and Canada . In March, a TikTok Canada spokesperson told the Global News via email that ""banning TikTok in the US would be devastating to Canadian TikTok creators and small businesses, many of whom rely on being able to reach Americans as a large part of their audience"". Additionally, says Schiele, ""There's a lot of cosmetic brands and skin care brands coming from Korea, especially, and China. That's a big thing [on TikTok] right now … those different beauty regimens and the great skin care products that they have."" They, too, will have to figure out a pivot to continue to reach US customers without TikTok. And it may be more difficult for international brands to do so. Schiele is optimistic many can, but worries that the blow to up-and-coming companies and international brands could be too much for some, especially smaller enterprises. Matt McGuckin is widely known as Dappz Sports on TikTok and started his sports trading card company out of his bedroom in 2019. The 35-year-old steadily built his online presence in the following years, but when Covid-19 shut down most of the world – including sports – thousands of people began flocking @dappzsports to talk about trading cards. More like this: The account now has one million followers, thanks in part to two teens who insisted McGuckin – who had been fighting with other creators for eyeballs on Instagram – build out his TikTok following. McGuckin began live streaming on the platform each night. After one evening in which he sold $70,000 (£56,195) in cards while streaming alongside his sister in his bedroom, he realised he was onto something big. He's concerned about the revenue hit Dappz Sports will take if a TikTok ban goes into effect, but he adds the platform is about much more than his personal income. As Dappz Sports expanded, McGuckin was able to create 90 jobs for people working in Los Angeles, including to actors and writers who were out of work throughout the Sag-Aftra and WGA strikes in 2023. He's also created a virtual gathering space for a cross-generational audience across dozens of countries, many of whom have visited Dappz Sports on TikTok for years. ""We have people who join our stream and they don't spend any money,"" he explains. ""They just come in every night and we're talking about sports and we're talking about our favourite games or we're talking about our favourite moments."" He will entertain alternative platforms, especially if they're necessary for the business to survive. Yet, says McGuckin, ""this is where we put our most energy into and where we built our community, and it would just be a shame [to lose it] even if we succeed on other platforms"". -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240425-us-tik-tok-ban-small-business-creator-revenue,business
102,US economic growth slows but inflation grows,"The US economy grew by less than forecast in the first three months of this year but inflation gathered pace, which could delay an interest rate cut. Official figures revealed the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 1.6%, far below expectations and the growth seen in the final months of 2023. Meanwhile, inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has increased. At the start of the year, experts had been forecasting a series of interest rate cuts in the US. However, inflation is yet to fall back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and on Thursday, figures from the US Department of Commerce showed that inflation increased by 3.4% in the first three months of 2024. This is compared to an increase of 1.8% in the final three months of 2023. Raising interest rates makes borrowing - for things such as loans and mortgages - more expensive and theoretically is meant to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand. However, US inflation has not fallen back as quickly as expected. At the same time, economic growth - measured as gross domestic product (GDP) - has slowed from 3.4% growth in the final three months of last year to 1.6%. Economists had been expected it to decelerate but only to 2.4%. Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch, the credit rating agency, said: ""The hot inflation print is the real story in this report. ""If growth continues to slowly decelerate, but inflation strongly takes off again in the wrong direction, the expectation of a Fed interest rate cut in 2024 is starting to look increasingly more out of reach."" The key US interest rate is between 5.25% to 5.5% - the highest level in more than 20 years. Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital in London, said the US Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, was ""now finding itself caught between a rock and a hard place"". ""The growth numbers suggest monetary policy has worked its magic and the Fed's foot on the monetary brake can be eased somewhat,"" he said. ""But the inflation figures suggest otherwise, and potentially even point to the need for a further tightening."" The 1.6% growth figure is the first estimate of GDP. A second reading, ""based on more complete source data"", will be released on 30 May. Nevertheless, the economy is a key issue as the US heads towards an election later this year.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68898432,business
103,How fraudsters are getting fake articles onto Facebook,"I have been really busy recently, writing articles about famous people. I've done interviews with the likes of Zoe Ball, Jeremy Clarkson and Chris Tarrant. There has been a common theme to these stories, and it is all about how each celebrity made vast sums of money from an online investment opportunity in crypto currencies. And if this all sounds a bit unbelievable, that's because it is - I hadn't done a single one of these interviews, nor written any of the articles. And none of the famous people involved, or me, would dream of endorsing crypto investments of any kind. Instead, the fake stories were all AI-generated scams that appeared on Facebook news feeds in a BBC template, and with my byline. The fraudsters behind them hope that people will click through to the full article, and from there be tempted to invest in a fake investment scheme being promoted on the page. I was curious as to how these scam posts were getting onto Facebook in the first place, so I contacted Tony Gee, a senior consultant at cybersecurity firm Penn Test Partners. After examining the URL, or web address, of one scam page he said it was most likely a paid-for Facebook advert. Mr Gee said he could tell that because the URL had a unique value that Facebook adds to allow it to track outbound clicks. I put this finding to Facebook's owner Meta, who said: ""We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms, and have removed the ads brought to our attention."" But how are the scammers able to get the fake ads onto Facebook news feeds in the first place? How can they get past Facebook's automated detection systems? Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, says the criminals appear to be using tools that very quickly redirect users to another web page. So when the advert is first placed with Facebook, the link goes through to a harmless page, one that doesn't try to con you out of your cash. But then once this has been approved by Facebook, the fraudsters then put on a redirect that instantly takes people somewhere else - to a web page that very much wants to maliciously dent your bank account. ""If you control a website then it is relatively easy to include a redirect command, such that before someone's browser has had a chance to show them the original webpage, their browser is sent to an alternative one,"" says Prof Woodward. He adds that the fraudsters can quickly and easily keep changing the destination of the redirect. ""As soon as you are able to obfuscate the true nature of a URL, that is manna for scammers,"" he says. This is a type of online fraud called ""cloaking"", whereby malicious adverts are able to get past a social media firm's review stage because the fraudsters have hidden their intentions. Meta says it is using what it has learnt about this technique to improve its automated detection systems. Read more stories on artificial intelligence Margaret (not her real name) is a retiree who lives in Buckinghamshire. She was recently conned out of £250 when she fell victim to fake advert on Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. She had been tempted to click on a link to a fictitious ITV article in which presenter Robert Peston (or rather, a scammer pretending it was him), chats about an investment opportunity he had come across. Margaret who trusts Mr Peston and the ITV brand decided to invest. In addition to paying the £250, Margaret sent off pictures of her passport, and both sides of her credit card. She immediately started getting phone calls. ""It was someone with an American accent welcoming me and saying my money was already making money,"" she tells me. The phone calls kept coming, as did a torrent of emails. Margaret became suspicious, particularly when they started asking her about her income and savings, and when she intended to invest more money. ""I contacted my bank and was refunded but it didn't stop the scammers."" Margaret still receives daily calls, and even started getting them from someone purporting to be from the US National Security Agency promising to help her investigate the scam. ""My own mental health is being impacted and I believe I am at risk, in particular identity theft and indeed potential monetary theft,"" she says. ""They are so mega persistent, and are dangerous pests."" It is an issue that UK consumer watchdog Which? has been looking into. ""Malicious advertisers may mask web links or impersonate trusted brands such as the BBC to evade online platforms' reporting systems, and people often don't know they're looking at a scam or a deepfake until it's too late,"" says Rocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy. ""It should not fall on consumers to protect themselves from this fraudulent content online. Ofcom must use its powers under the Online Safety Act [which was passed late last year] to ensure that online platforms are verifying the legitimacy of their advertisers to prevent scammers reaching consumers."" Ofcom said in a statement that tackling fraud ""is a priority"" for the regulator. ""The UK's new online safety laws will be an important part of making it harder for fraudsters to operate,"" it added. ""Under the new laws, online services will be required to assess the risk of their users being harmed by illegal content on their platforms - including fraud, take appropriate steps to protect their users, and remove illegal content when they identify it or are told about it."" Nicolas Corry is managing director at financial investigation firm Skadi. He says he was ""troubled"" by the amount of causal fraud occurring on Facebook and other social media sites. ""These companies are making vast amounts of profits, and exposing people to fraud,"" he adds. ""And then it's the finance companies that pay for this, or the victims themselves."" Mr Corry says social media firms should be more rigorously checking each advert, and its links, before they allow them to go up.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68843985,business
104,Boycotts aren't the only way to hold companies accountable,"A growing group of conscious consumers have found other strategies to keep companies honest. Consumers have long wielded their purchasing power to send messages to companies whose stances they disagree with. Boycotts can take the form of personal snubs at a shop, or large-scale, highly publicised movements. While many of these boycotts often fall ""into the dustbin of outrage "", swaths of consumers are still more determined than ever to spend with companies whose values and ethics align with their own – and to divert their dollars from companies whose practices don't. But although it's simple to pluck an alternative brand from the shelf, making a dent in any one com pany's bottom line is difficult in an age of conglomeration: many brands are just one in a larger business's portfolio of multiple products, often across sectors. Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania, US, points to the recent US boycott of Bud Light as an example. In April 2023, the alcohol brand faced a backlash from some conservative consumers, commentators, and celebrities for its partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. While many consumers chose to boycott Bud Light, hoping to hurt their revenue, shoppers who picked an alternative product may have inadvertently sent their money towards the brand, anyway. ""There are so many sister brands of Bud Light that it's actually, in practice, much more complicated than just not drinking that brand of beer if you're trying to have an impact,"" says Schweitzer. Bud Light is owned by Anheuser-Busch, which also owns more than 100 brands including Budweiser, Kona Big Wave, Landshark and more. Schweitzer says this situation is common, citing Amazon as an example, which owns brands including Whole Foods and Audible. He explains that if there's a call to boycott the Amazon ecommerce platform, protesters are likely still patronising Amazon's many other holdings, including Amazon Web Services which hosts popular sites including Netflix, Facebook and Airbnb. Overall, set-ups like this make it incredibly difficult to divert spending on ethical grounds, especially when conglomeration may be opaque and ongoing, and global business is always evolving. Large companies are snapping up start-ups and smaller brands all the time, and making moves responding to geopolitical circumstances that are changing every day . It can be almost impossible to keep up, even for the savviest consumer. Recognising these challenges, some people are taking a new approach to boycotts. Instead of flat-out avoiding certain brands that make moves they disagree with, some consumers are consistently directing their money to companies in which they are confident. These conscious consumers are highly informed: they're hyper-aware of where and how products are made and distributed, and spend with the brands whose ethics align with their own. At the same time, however, they're also practical, and don't see shopping ethically as zero-sum. Many understand the situation of conglomeration and its moving-target nature, and see interacting with companies that they disagree with as an unavoidable part of daily life. They may also be more likely to forgive themselves for the occasional fast fashion or 'un-green' purchase, say experts. Despite this, however, these informed consumers are simultaneously pushing companies to improve their policies. To win back customers, brands must work to gain trust through transparency about missteps and the strides they've taken to fix them. This is often enough to bring conscious consumers back on board – something companies have noticed and is incentivising them to act. Indeed, says Moriarty, when potentially damaging news comes out about brands that consumers feel are closely ethically aligned with their own stances, those shoppers are often willing to allow the brand to redeem itself. ""It's easy for brands to lose trust. But it's not impossible for brands to regain that trust. Consumers don't really like change. In many cases, we look for brands to support us through any transitions, particularly with big picture issues like sustainability or ethical issues,"" he says. ""And it's very difficult for us to give up things even when we hear bad news about a brand, or it's reported that brand has done something wrong."" Experts say these conscious consumers are changing the way businesses big and small respond to ethical backlash. Even if shoppers may not be fully boycotting brands, their consumption behaviour and attention to corporate practices actively puts pressure on brands to change and evolve. ""That's conscious consumerism,"" says Simon Moriarty, director of trends research at market-intelligence firm Mintel. He adds Mintel's trend research shows consumers are eager to see the redemption arc. And many are more willing to hold companies accountable for missteps if it means keeping their favourite items in the cart. One example is Oatly, a Swedish food company that produces oat-based alternatives to daily products. The brand, formed in the 1990s, entered the scene as not only as a challenger to global dairy conglomerates, but also positioned itself as more sustainable than these companies. More like this: In 2022, however, Oatly found itself in hot water after making ""misleading"" environmental claims in which they described their carbon footprint without sufficient evidence. Yet despite the news, consumers seeking a greener alternative to dairy didn't abandon the company outright. Instead, says Moriarity, they carefully tracked the company's statements, and pushed Oatly to release a clear plan to correct the reporting error and operate more sustainably. ""Consumers are a crucial part of the puzzle in shifting to more sustainable choices,"" says Shaunagh Duncan, Oatly's head of sustainability for Europe and international markets. September 2023 proprietary Oatly data, seen by the BBC, showed 59% of UK adults say they would change their food and drink consumption behaviour based on ""accurate information"" about the company's business practices. Duncan agrees companies should be proactive about making shifts and communicating them to their customer base. The strategy seems to be working for Oatly. In 2023, the company reported $783.3m (£630m) in revenue. In their Q4 earnings call, Oatly announced it expects revenue to increase by 5% to 10% in 2024. Still, says Mintel's Moriarty, not every consumer is shopping so consciously. Overwhelmingly, most people will either boycott brands or not protest at all. ""People want to do the right thing, but sometimes that's complicated especially as the news cycle shifts,"" says Schweitzer. Increasingly, however, consumers will find that landing somewhere in the middle may actually force the most change. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240415-product-boycotts-conscious-consumerism,business
105,Do women-only co-working spaces have a future?,"Women-only business networking and co-working clubs like Chief in London and The Co-Working Space in Nottingham have recently closed their doors. The concept gained a lot of traction around the height of the MeToo movement. Some women find the idea a step backwards, but for others these clubs are a way to level the playing field. The idea of men-only ""gentlemen's clubs"" is well established, with centuries-old places like White's and The Garrick Club in London. But women-only ones have been on the rise too over the past decade, often with a twist - they focus on the idea of co-working. Co-working spaces are big, open-plan offices with hot desks and nice amenities where people can come and work on a membership basis. They have grown in popularity as remote working has become easier. Women-only co-working spaces hit the headlines about eight years ago thanks to The Wing in the US. It was founded in New York by Audrey Gelman, former press secretary to Hillary Clinton, against the backdrop of the MeToo movement and Donald Trump's rise to power. It raised millions in funding, with a promise of female empowerment. But then it suffered a spectacular fall during the pandemic. There was a staff revolt, with allegations of mistreatment and racism. Its pricing model led to accusations of social exclusivity. It was also hit by legal challenges for sexual discrimination over its core women-only membership policy. The self-proclaimed ""female utopia"" abruptly closed all of its spaces in the summer of 2022, including a branch in London. Despite the demise of The Wing, other women-only co-working spaces are still operating. There are about 50 in Europe, including several in the UK. One such place is The Hearth, in north London. Bonnie Lister Parsons, founder of SOS Dance Global, a digital platform that teaches women how to dance, is a regular. So why is she a member? It's been challenging growing her business as a woman, she explains, as only about 2% of venture capital funding goes to female-led companies. ""When you are operating in a world with a lot of headwinds, being in an all-female space is refreshing - and joyful,"" she says. She also says she wasn't impressed by her tour of the co-working space WeWork, where they were keen to boast about the free beer on tap: ""For the guy showing me round it was a massive selling point. I know not all women dislike beer, but personally, I couldn't care less."" Audrey Gelman, founder of The Wing, used to argue that rival co-working spaces had ""pumps for beer, but not for breast milk"". The Hearth is designed to feel like ""your dream home"", according to its founder Oi Leng Lui. The walls and furnishings are relaxing, pastel colours and an aromatic smell is pumped into the space where women hot desk. There is even a wellness room. Susie Campbell, a business adviser and coach, is another regular. ""I used to work in the City for many years - a very male-dominated environment,"" she explains. ""The air conditioning was always down too low... there's something just really safe here and a sense of community."" There are a handful of other women-only co-working spaces in the UK, including Egg in Edinburgh and Maven in Winchester, a former bridal shop which the owner decided to convert. Zoe Ellis-Moore is the founder of Spaces to Places, which advises companies on how to find the best flexible office space. Women-only co-working spaces should be seen as part of a wider trend of people wanting to work flexibly in ""tribes"", she says. ""We've seen a huge growth in these niche areas,"" she says, ""like spaces for tech start-ups or flexible catering spaces for hospitality companies."" Start-ups and freelancers want to work flexibly, but with a community of like-minded people, she points out, and women-only spaces represent a tribe, just like these. In 2017, the New York City Commission on Human Rights launched an investigation into The Wing over the issue of gender discrimination and the following year, a man filed a lawsuit against The Wing in Washington DC after he was refused admission. The Wing adapted its membership rules to say that anyone could join, as long as they were committed to its mission of supporting women. Other women-only spaces in the US followed suit. The Coven in Minnesota started in 2018 as a women-only space after a successful crowdfunding campaign and now has four spaces. It has 1,000 members but men now make up about 20% of that figure. ""We were hearing from members that they wanted to invite more of their male friends into the space,"" says Erin Farrell, co-founder of The Coven, ""which led us to think, when we talk about physical and psychological safety, how tied to gender is that?"" Ms Farrell says they were aware of the legal challenges that The Wing was facing, but their own language never excluded men, it was always just women-focused, so accepting men was not a significant issue. Those that choose to join tend to be ""allies and accomplices"", she adds, and the clubs' amenities and programme of events remain women-focused. So where does this leave women-only spaces in the UK? ""Equality legislation in the UK [enshrined in the Equality Act] generally protects against discrimination based on gender in the supply of services,"" according to Sarah Evans, partner at Constantine Law, which specialises in employment and discrimination law, ""but there are exceptions, including for associations, groups and private clubs."" ""Criteria apply, but women-only co-working groups, with the aim of supporting and facilitating women doing business together, are highly unlikely to fall foul of anti-discrimination laws,"" she says. The other pressing question is, are these spaces empowering women in the long term? Some workplace experts are not convinced. ""While women-only spaces can provide temporary relief from conflict, judgement, assumptions, and distractions,"" says Blaire Palmer, leadership consultant and author of Punks in Suits, ""it is vital that we all learn how to challenge each other and develop the skills to bring our unique perspective to our work. ""Women-only spaces are useful for exploring, in a safer environment, the challenges of being a woman in what is still not a level playing field, but they should never become a place to hide permanently."" However, others think that women-only work clubs are counterproductive. ""Women-only co-working spaces are a step backwards,"" according to Anne Kirby, who set up The Candy Factory co-working space in Pennsylvania. ""Yes, women have unique challenges and are at a disadvantage in the business world, but how does removing yourself from real life get you anywhere? How can we expect men to understand the need for respect and equality if we subtract them from our daily work lives? ""We're working to disrupt the 'good ol' boys club' mentality; why create the same thing for women?"" Back downstairs at The Hearth, a lunch-and-learn workshop is taking place. The women who were working away on their laptops are now sitting in a square listening to a talk by Elena Megan, a self-discovery and mindset coach. An audience member shares a story that perhaps explains the attraction of a women-only co-working space like this for some. She says she has always struggled to network with men because she feels they do not treat her like an equal professional. The other members nod and murmur in agreement.",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68733573,business
106,Spotify turns up volume to make record profits,"Music streaming giant Spotify has announced record profits of over €1bn (£860m) after a year of cutting costs and laying off staff. The Swedish company has been growing its user base for years, offering subscribers access to podcasts and audiobooks. But its quarterly gross profit came at the expense of missing its forecast for monthly active users. Last year it cut 17% of its workforce in a move to clamp down on costs. Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek said last December about 1,500 jobs would be axed as part of ""substantial action to rightsize our costs"" so that the company could meet its objectives. But the tech company has been on a mission expand worldwide and reach a billion users by 2030. On Tuesday it announced that mission would start again in earnest, with money being spent to win over new audiences. ""We are going to add back some marketing spend over the year,"" Mr Ek said. ""Because we want to keep on having the growth and we saw that in some territories, we may have pulled back a little bit too much."" Much of Spotify's profits were driven by its podcast business. Gross margins rose to 27.6% in the quarter, up from 25.2% a year earlier. It invested over a billion euros to build up its podcast business, including spending hundreds of millions for popular shows such as the ""The Joe Rogan Experience"". ""It [podcasting] was a drag last year. Now it is another profit centre for us,"" Mr Ek said. The company's quarterly revenue rose 20% to €3.64bn, beating estimates of €3.61bn. Spotify has raised prices to boost revenue and experimented with different subscription plans. The streaming service would also provide a music-only tier for ""those consumers that only care about the music side"", the firm's CEO said. Spotify currently has 615 million users, a shade down on its own forecast of 618 million for the quarter. It aims to have 631 million midway through the year. However, the number of premium subscribers rose by 14% in the first quarter to 239 million, in line with estimates. Spotify shares, which initially fell on the quarter results, reversed course to rise 8% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Since it launched in 2006, Spotify has invested a huge amount of money growing the business, and in securing exclusive content. Podcasts created by Michelle and Barack Obama, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have all featured on the platform. The deal with Harry and Meghan cost a reported $25m (£19.7m) and saw just 12 episodes delivered over two-and-a-half years before the deal ended last June.",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68884501,business
107,Why your small goods come in gigantic boxes,"Even the tiniest purchases often end up in massive packaging. It's not necessarily company carelessness – but it's still a big problem. The saying goes, ""good things come in small packages"". But many online shoppers don't know that joy. If you order a comb the size of an envelope, there's a good chance it will arrive on your doorstep in a cardboard box that could fit a trombone. This trend is more than just annoying – it's a sustainability nightmare. More than three billion trees are cut down every year to make the paper-based packaging that ends up cluttering your home or stuffed in a refuse bin, says Nicole Rycroft, executive director of Canopy, an environmental non-profit that works with companies to preserve endangered forests. Paper packaging production volumes have increased by 65% throughout the past two decades , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The spike in online shopping is only making things worse. ""In the early days of e-commerce, [products] had seven-times more packaging than with a brick-and-mortar purchase,"" says Rycroft. ""It's now around four-and-a-half times as much, but still, that's a lot of excessive packaging."" Yet companies aren't simply being careless in the mismatch between product and container sizing, notes Barry Kronhaus, director of sales and marketing at Sun Packaging Technologies. ""It's not quite as haphazard as it might seem, he says. ""Places like Amazon and Walmart and their e-commerce fulfilment [centres] spend a lot of time trying to figure this out."" Yet the solution isn't so easy. Typically, box size is determined by using software or an algorithm – and it often finds the correct match. But humans are still involved in getting orders order to customers, which is often how goods wind up in outsize containers. For instance, a warehouse simply may not have enough of the right size of box, forcing a packer to pick the next best alternative, which is often bigger. ""When you're relying on humans and they've got 100,000 orders to get out, they have to get it done fast,"" says Kronhaus. Especially when customers are paying the shipping charges, he adds, it doesn't hurt the company's bottom line to opt for the next size up. In some cases, consumers may actually place more value on products that come in larger containers. This is called ""packaging psychology"", says Rycroft, and some companies use it to their advantage – or at least don't go out of their way to ensure boxes are right sized for their contents. An item that arrives in a large package makes the purchase seem like a good deal , according to Amsterbrand Marketing, a Dutch market research company. Buyers project human traits onto packaging that can also influence their purchasing decisions. For instance, a 2017 study on symbolic packaging clues found customers associated tall and thin food packages with health and slimness . Brands looking to target certain feelings may adapt their packaging accordingly. Whatever the reason behind the mismatch, excessive packaging creates a substantial waste problem. The larger the packaging, the larger its carbon footprint – and the more ecological devastation it can cause. While cardboard boxes from online orders are perhaps the most visible culprit, many industries use oversized packaging, primarily made from paper and plastic. Canopy estimates the food and beverage industry is the largest end-use sector for paper packaging, with beauty and personal care not far behind. And some brands in the fashion industry use as much fibre in their packaging as they do in their textiles and clothing, adds Rycloft. Currently, 54% of the pulp used to make the paper packaging that becomes boxes and filling is made from recycled paper, according to data provided by Canopy, seen by the BBC. But 43% of that pulp is still made from virgin forest fibre – new wood that has been harvested for the first time. The organisation shared with the BBC that half of this virgin fibre could be coming from forests that are designated as ""ancient and endangered"". That leaves just 3% of pulp that's made from alternative forest-free eco-friendly fibres like wheat straw or bagasse. This is a major issue as forest preservation has become integral in the fight against climate change. For the 76.3 million hectares (189.5 million acres) of primary forests in the tropics that have been lost throughout the past 20 years alone, approximately one-third of the world's total forests have been destroyed due to human activity. This includes logging for paper packaging – the demand drives about a tenth of this destruction, according to the FAO. There are other culprits, too. When those large boxes show up, they are often filled with several plastic ""air pillows"" to pad the products inside and plastic packaging presents a similar environmental scourge. Plastic can take anywhere from 20 to 500 years to break down , according to the UN. Research in 2020 from ocean conservation organisation Oceana reported that Amazon alone generated 465 million pounds (211 kg) of plastic packaging waste in 2019. The number of air pillows they alone could ""circle the Earth 500 times"". An Amazon spokesperson disputed the report , telling Vox they used ""about a quarter of the plastic packaging estimated by Oceana's report"", and that it has reduced the weight of its outbound packaging by more than a third since 2015, eliminating nearly one million tons of packaging material. To combat all the contributing detrimental effects on the environment, sustainability advocates are going directly to the retailers who are using these resource-intensive materials, both in shipping containers and in the product packaging itself. Canopy, for instance, works with companies and retailers to ensure their packaging is not coming from a high carbon, high biodiversity value forest or generating any new virgin plastic. Instead, they advise companies to transition to using recyclable, compostable and NextGen materials, which use gene editing to create synthetic fibres. EcoEnclose, a US-based company that creates sustainable packaging and shipping supplies, offers products including recycled plastic wrap and display boxes with regenerative seaweed film as more thoughtful replacements. Ideally, however, retailers should find ways to forgo excess packaging all together. Some e-commerce companies specifically are working towards this goal, both with minimising the volume and size of boxes they ship in as well as eliminating as much product packaging as possible. At global retailer Lush, about half of the beauty brand's products can be taken home with no packaging . The company has carried these efforts over to e-commerce. ""Starting in 2008, we decided to start shipping more products 'naked', to the point that currently, if products are not in a pot or bottle, they are consistently shipped naked in the box,"" says Ruth Andrade, environmental partner at Lush. More like this: Lush has also optimised box size to ensure there are appropriate options for the workers hand-packing the orders. This is part of widespread innovation throughout the past few years that Sun Packaging Technologies's Kronhaus says has enabled more accurate sizing in the packaging industry. Devices such as the dimensioning system Cubiscan scan the products needing to be boxed, and either instructs a machine to build a box that's the correct size for its contents, or determines what existing size box is best suited. According to Kronhaus, companies including Walmart and Amazon are now using this technology in certain facilities. This technology doesn't just help with shipping. It also optimises storage within warehouses – another reason some companies are jumping on board. Kronhous says innovative packaging can reduce the amount of warehouse space needed by two thirds, which saves a company money. Another storage alternative is the reuse of materials, something Rycloft says saved one of Canopy's global retailer clients €14m ($15m; £12m). By reconstituting boxes used for warehouse deliveries, they were able to reuse the boxes on average six times, resulting in an 82% reduction in overall packaging. While these moves don't directly influence the size of packages that ultimately end up on doorsteps, they are an important part of improving sustainability across the entire supply chain. While significant strides have been made towards reducing packaging waste, there's still more work ahead. In November 2022, the European Commission introduced legislation to reduce packaging waste, including excessive box size. By March 2024, however, lobbyists had succeeded in making paper packaging largely exempt from this crackdown. ""The regulation now promotes single-use paper packaging, often lined with plastic, at the cost of global forests and the climate,"" Sergio Baffoni, a campaigner at the global Environmental Paper Network, said in a statement . ""Industry lobbyists are celebrating, but consumers will continue to be hounded by increasing amounts of waste in their homes – there may be less plastic, but there will be far more paper – and far fewer forests."" Ultimately, no one aspect of the packaging waste problem can be solved without addressing the entire chain. The use of sustainable packaging materials relies on their accessibility, and the streamlining of packaging relies not just on precise calculations, but also effective delivery systems that don't necessitate excess packaging to keep items safe in transit. ""I think that's where our work really comes to the fore,"" says Rycroft. ""Where the large corporate end consumer customers can create enough of a value proposition for the delivery entities to come to the table along with the packaging manufacturers."" There, they can finally come up with a solution that's one size fits all. -- For the best of BBC.com in your inbox every Friday, sign up to The Essential List newsletter for a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news.",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240415-why-your-small-goods-come-in-gigantic-boxes,business
108,UK borrowing casts doubt on pre-election tax cut prospects,"Higher than expected government borrowing has reduced the scope for pre-election tax cuts, analysts say. Government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £120.7bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said. While this was lower than the previous year, it was £6.6bn more than the government's forecaster had predicted. The government cut National Insurance in March and there has been talk it could trim taxes again in the autumn. However, Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the chancellor was hoping March's figures would provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year, he will have been disappointed."" In addition to the higher borrowing, she noted that government interest payments could be larger than expected given that interest rates are no longer forecast to fall as quickly as previously hoped. This would reduce the headroom for the government to meet its self-imposed spending rules. Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, the think tank focused on lower income households, said that the latest figures suggested there were ""no signs of extra wriggle room"" for any pre-election Budget. The government's independent forecasting body, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had predicted that borrowing over the year would be £114.1bn. A general election has to be held before the end of January 2025, and there has been speculation the government will try to cut taxes again later this year before voters head to the polling stations. Last week, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the Financial Times that he would like to cut taxes in the autumn ""if we can"". The chancellor reduced National Insurance by 2p in the pound in the spring Budget following a 2p cut announced in last year's Autumn Statement. The OBR estimated that each cut will cost the government nearly £10bn. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he still expected the chancellor to cut taxes again before an election. However, he added that the next government would ""face a tricky choice between raising taxes to fix creaking public services or holding the line on the chancellor's recent tax cuts"". ""We suspect whoever the next government is will end up pushing through at least some tax rises to balance the books."" Jessica Barnaby, ONS deputy director for public sector finances, said that over the past year government spending was up by about £58bn ""with increased spending on public services and benefits outstripping large reductions in interest payable and energy support scheme costs"". ""But with public sector income up £66bn, overall, the deficit still fell,"" she said. The ONS also noted that these are the initial estimates of public sector finances for last financial year, and figures will be revised over the coming months. Borrowing in March alone was £11.9bn, which was £4.7bn less than a year earlier but still higher than analysts had expected. Total debt - which is the overall amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years - was £2.7 trillion at the end of March. That is the equivalent of 98.3% of the size of the UK's economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), remaining at levels last seen in the early 1960s, the ONS said. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Debt increased in recent years because we rightly protected millions of jobs during Covid and paid half of people's energy bills after Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent bills skyrocketing."" He added that the government ""must stick to the plan to get debt falling"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney MP said: ""Years of Conservative chaos has left Britain with spiralling taxes and mortgages, all whilst borrowing remains out of control. This is another damning blow for the Conservative government's economic credibility.""",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68874849,business
109,"How much money is the UK government borrowing, and does it matter?","The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest - and that can influence wider tax and spending plans. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on their profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens. But if it can't, it will cover the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which they hope will help the economy. The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called ""quantitative easing"" . The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. For instance, when people submit tax returns in January, they often pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, so the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date. In the year to March, the government borrowed £120.7bn . While it was lower than the previous year, it was £6.6bn more than the government's forecaster predicted. Borrowing in March alone stood at £11.9bn, which was £4.7bn less than a year earlier. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about £2.7 trillion. That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year , known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level. But in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century, and also compared with some other leading economies. The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s, but it is more noticeable now that interest rates have been rising. Around a quarter of UK debt is index-linked, meaning payments are directly linked to the rate of inflation. Rising prices in the last two years have pushed up the bill for servicing debt significantly. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying its debts, it may mean it has less to spend on the public services which it borrowed to fund in the first place. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt fluctuates, and by one measure, hit a 20-year high in early October 2023 . The most significant figures tracking the cost of debt are published monthly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). According to this data, two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: £20.2bn in June and £18bn in December. June 2023 saw the third largest monthly amount - £13.1bn. The most recent figure for March revealed interest on government debt was £2.5bn. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has previously said the government will take ""difficult but responsible"" decisions on the public finances. He previously blamed the ""twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine"" for driving up government costs. The chancellor has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time. In the Budget in March, the chancellor said the government was on track to meet the debt target. The government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted that debt will fall as a share of the economy to 92.9% in 2028-29. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises and government finances will be a key focus in the run-up to a General Election. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run. With measures such as a cut in National Insurance announced at the March Budget, the OBR expects borrowing to rise slightly in the next financial year , before remaining in line with previous forecasts. It would fall below 3% of GDP by 2025-26, meeting one of the financial rules the government has decided to set itself. But the OBR has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. In its latest forecasts in March, the OBR said debt, measured against the size of the economy, is still set to rise over the next four years, before falling back marginally in the fifth year. Other economists argue that big economies like the UK could borrow much more than they currently do , and the negative impact is greatly exaggerated. The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50504151,business
110,US watchdog sues to block $8.5bn handbag takeover,"The US competition watchdog has sued to block fashion accessory giant Tapestry's $8.5bn (£6.9bn) takeover of rival Capri. Tapestry owns handbag makers including Coach and Kate Spade, while Capri's brands include Michael Kors. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said if allowed, ""the deal would eliminate direct head-to-head competition between Tapestry’s and Capri’s brands"". In response Tapestry said ""the FTC fundamentally misunderstands both the marketplace and the way in which consumers shop"". Together, the firms employ about 33,000 staff globally but the FTC argued the deal could reduce wages and their benefits. Coach and Kate Spade are known for what their parent firm calls ""accessible luxury"" handbags - quality leather and craftsmanship products at affordable prices. Tapestry offered to buy Capri in August, hoping to create a US fashion giant that could compete against bigger European rivals such as Chanel, Hermes and Louis Vuitton parent LVMH. The FTC requested more information on the deal in November. Announcing its decision to take legal action , the FTC said the deal would give Tapestry a dominant share of the market. Tapestry said in a statement that ""in bringing this case, the FTC has chosen to ignore the reality of today’s dynamic and expanding $200 billion global luxury industry"". Capri, which also owns Versace and Jimmy Choo, said ""this transaction will not limit, reduce, or constrain competition"" as the two firms ""operate in the fiercely competitive and highly fragmented global luxury industry"". It is unusual for the US regulator to try to block a high-end fashion merger. But in December, authorities issued new merger guidelines to encourage fair, open and competitive markets. By using a new tactic under the guidelines, the FTC has argued that the merger of Tapestry and Capri would directly affect hourly workers who may lose out on higher wages due to reduced competition for employees. Earlier this month, the companies received regulatory clearance for the deal from the European Union and Japan. The two companies need to close the deal by 10 August.",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglv3xgmkgyo,business
111,How robots are taking over warehouse work,"Shoppers probably don't think much about what happens next when they place an online grocery order. But it sets-off an intricate dance of software, artificial intelligence, robots, vans and workers. At an Ocado warehouse just outside Luton, I'm in the middle of such a dance. As far as I can see, hundreds of robots whizz around a grid, fetching items for online orders. They move with dizzying speed and precision. In the early days of online shopping, when you placed an order, humans would dash around a warehouse or a store collecting your items. But for years now, Ocado has been using robots to collect and distribute products, bringing them to staff, who pack them into boxes for delivery. And Ocado is not the only firm investing in such automation. In its warehouses, Asda uses a system from Swiss automation firm Swisslog and Norway's AutoStore. In the US, Walmart has been automating parts of its supply chain using robotics from an American company called Symbotic. Back in Luton, Ocado has taken its automation process to a higher level. The robots which zoom around the grid, now bring items to robotic arms, which reach out and grab what they need for the customer's shop. Bags of rice, boxes of tea, packets of crumpets are all grabbed by the arms using a suction cup on the end. It might seem like a trivial addition, but training a robot to recognise an item, grab it successfully and move it, is surprisingly difficult. At Ocado around 100 engineers have spent years training the artificial intelligence (AI) to take on that task. James Matthews, chief executive of Ocado Technology explains the AI has to interpret the information coming from its cameras. ""What is an object? Where are the edges of that object? How would one grasp it?"" In addition the AI has to work out how to move the arm. ""How do I pick that up and accelerate in a way without flinging it across the room? How do I place it in a bag?"" he says. The Luton warehouse has 44 robotic arms, which at the moment account for 15% of the products that flow through the facility, that's about 400,000 items a week. The rest are handled by staff at picking stations. The staff handle items that robots are not ready for yet, like wine bottles which are heavy and have curved surfaces, making them difficult to grasp. But the system is ramping up. The company is developing different attachments for the robot arms that will allow them to handle a wider variety of items. ""We're just playing it carefully and ramping slowly over time,"" says Mr Matthews. ""It's a deliberate constraint on our behalf, so we continue providing good service to people, and not crushed custard creams in every order, or worse, putting stuff on the track that goes under the wheels of one of the bots and creates an incident."" In two or three years Ocado expects the robots will account for 70% of the products. This inevitably means fewer human staff, but the Luton warehouse still has 1,400 staff, and many of those will still be needed in the future. ""There will be some sort of curve that tends towards fewer people per building. But it's not as clear cut as, 'hey, look, we're on the verge of just not needing people'. We're a very long way from that,"" Mr Matthews says. Ocado is hoping to sell its automation technology to companies outside the grocery sector. Late last year it announced a deal with Canada's McKesson, a large pharmaceuticals distributor. ""Think about which industries have the need to move things around efficiently inside of warehouse... it's endless,"" says Mr Matthews. More technology of business So where will the automation of warehouses end? Are we heading to human-free warehouses that can run 24 hours a day? Not so fast, says Sarah Bolton, who specialises in commercial real estate at law firm Taylor Wessing. ""It's almost prohibitively expensive, we're talking hundreds of millions of pounds to fully automate a warehouse,"" she points out. ""So you're really only talking about the big tenants in the really big warehouses looking at full automation, just because you have to have that size to make it anywhere near financially viable."" She also points that automation needs modern buildings, including floors that can stand heavy weights, large spaces without support columns, so there's less for the robots to crash into. Reliable electricity connections are also vital. ""You're reliant on new build, and there's a massive undersupply of new build warehouse stock in the UK at the minute,"" says Ms Bolton. AutoStore is tackling some of those challenges. It has a company called Pio which is developing automation for smaller businesses. It uses much of the same technology that AutoStore supplies to big firms - robots buzzing around on a storage grid where goods are stacked vertically. However the upfront costs of Pio's system are lower, with the cost related to the volume of goods the system handles. The software is simpler and designed to integrate easily with common e-commerce systems like Shopify. ""It's a complete offering... where the upfront cost is very reduced. So it's quite affordable for these companies to get access to automation and start to get the benefits out of it. And since the technology is very flexible and scalable, you can continue to basically increase volume by adding more robots rather than more storage capacity,"" says Carlos Fernández, chief product officer at AutoStore. At the moment 10 clients are running Pio's automation system with another five customers signed up. Mr Fernández sees huge growth potential. ""Over the coming years, there's going to be a journey of making the technology simpler and more affordable. It won't require you to be a large corporation to run complex automation projects, and you won't need to invest big amounts of capital also to start getting the benefits.""",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68639533,business
112,Train strikes announced for May Bank Holiday week,"Rail passengers are being warned of disruption during the week of the May Bank Holiday after drivers announced more strikes and an overtime ban. Staff at 16 train companies will take part in rolling one-day walkouts between 7 and 9 May over pay and working conditions. An overtime ban will also take place between 6 and 11 May. Passengers are advised to check before they travel, with the action likely to lead to delays and cancellations. The Bank Holiday falls on 6 May this year. Aslef, the train drivers' union, said it is seeking better pay for its members and claimed drivers are being asked to sacrifice working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Drivers from several train companies will strike on different days. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, the body that negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, said: ""This wholly unnecessary strike action called by the Aslef leadership will sadly disrupt customers and businesses once again, while further damaging the railway at a time when taxpayers are continuing to contribute an extra £54m a week just to keep services running. ""We continue to seek a fair agreement with the Aslef leadership which both rewards our people, gives our customers more reliable services and makes sure the railway isn't taking more than its fair share from taxpayers."" Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary, said: ""It is now a year since we sat in a room with the train companies - and a year since we rejected the risible offer they made and which they admitted, privately, was designed to be rejected."" Little progress has been made in solving the row between Aslef and the rail companies since the union first started striking in July 2022. The most recent pay deal was rejected almost a year ago in April 2023. The offer included 4% pay rises for two years in a row, on condition that drivers would accept industry-wide changes to training, and negotiate changes to work patterns at individual operators. The last series of train strikes took place during the first and second weeks of April. However, a London Underground drivers' strike scheduled for Monday 8 April and Saturday 4 May was called off. A spokesperson for Aslef said at the time that ""key issues"" had been ""successfully resolved"" in the London Underground dispute ""without the need for strikes"". The train drivers' dispute is stuck on repeat. And passengers are left in the middle of a standoff with no current end in sight. Each time a new strike is announced, the government insists the offer which Aslef's committee rejected a year ago should be put to members in a vote. Ministers and the industry group which does the negotiating say any deal has to be fair to be taxpayers, who put billions in subsidies into the railway every year. Aslef argues those proposals, especially with strings attached to a pay rise, were never going to be acceptable to its members. It thinks a better offer should be put forward. The government wants to cut costs and the industry argues proposed changes would also increase reliability. But from Aslef's perspective, members are being asked to give up too much by way of terms and conditions, for the pay rise that's on offer. Train drivers have kept voting for more industrial action. So, the strikes keep coming. It is difficult to see a resolution coming before the general election. And whoever's in government after that, it's not clear what they would do differently to end the dispute.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68874928,business
113,FTSE 100 stock index closes at new all-time high,"The FTSE 100 stock index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies has reached a new record closing price. The fresh all-time high was driven by a weaker pound and easing tensions in the Middle East. The index closed on Monday at 8,023.87 points to mark the new record, surpassing its previous high of 8,012.53 in February last year. It was up 1.62% at its close, with retailers M&S, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Ocado among the big risers of the day. Shares have benefitted from a weaker pound because the index on the London Stock Exchange has many firms with big footprints overseas. A weak pound makes goods they export cheaper for foreign buyers and helps inflate the value of business done elsewhere. Rachel Winter, wealth manager at Killik & Co, said: ""The FTSE contains a large number of big international companies that earn their revenue in dollars and report their profits in sterling. ""The strength of the dollar is due to sticky inflation in the US, which means that US interest rates will remain higher for longer."" The pound was down 0.2% at $1.234 as a result, representing sterling's lowest point against the US currency for around five months. Axel Rudolph, senior market analyst at IG, said the ""de-escalation in the Middle East"" also played its part to propel the FTSE 100 to its new record. The index has been steadily ticking upwards in recent weeks on hopes the Bank of England will cut interest rates as inflation falls steadily back down to the central bank's 2% target rate. By making borrowing less expensive, lower interest rates discourage saving and can increase borrowing for home purchases and business investments, helping to breathe life back into the economy. It would be the first cut since March 2020. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""The Bank of England is now expected to start cutting rates before the US Federal Reserve sharpens its knife and that's led to divergent fortunes for the respective currencies."" He added that the ""favourite items on the menu to fill portfolios"" included Marks & Spencer, which was the recipient of a positive broker note, alongside Next and Sainsbury's. ""All three saw their ratings lifted from 'hold' to 'buy' as part of a review of the broader retail sector,"" he said.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68877506,business
114,Homeowner pain as major banks lift mortgage rates,"Some of the UK's biggest banks are raising mortgage rates as expectations of when the Bank of England will cut interest rates are pushed back. Barclays, HSBC and NatWest are all increasing some costs on fixed-rate mortgage deals from Tuesday. Mortgage rates have risen over the past few weeks as views have changed on when the Bank might cut borrowing costs. The Bank is now not expected to cut its benchmark rate as early or as often as previously thought. The announcement from Barclays, which is lifting rates for the second time in the space of seven days, will see a 0.1% increase across a range of its mortgage products. NatWest said it would raise some of its two and five-year ""switcher"" deals for existing customers by 0.1%. HSBC added it was increasing some of its rates on Tuesday, but did not give details of the increases. Building societies are also raising fees. Leeds Building Society said it was increasing the fixed rate on selected products by up to 0.2% for both new and existing customers. The Co-op said it was putting up the rates on some of its fixed deals by up to 0.41% from Monday but cutting the rate by 0.07% on others. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.82%, while the average five-year fixed rate is 5.40%. Broker Justin Moy from EHF Mortgages said a 0.1% increase would not make a big impact on those with small mortgages, but warned homeowners with larger loans - £300,000 or more - would notice a difference. ""With Barclays, they've had two nibbles, 0.2% last Thursday and then 0.1% tomorrow [Tuesday], that's 0.3% overall. For someone borrowing £300,000 that's an increase of £4,500 over five years,"" he told the BBC. The rises would cause ""loads of aggravation"" for borrowers and brokers, Mr Moy said. ""It starts a panic off because customers see rates going up,"" he added. Lenders are lifting rates as they respond to changing predictions about the future direction of the Bank of England's benchmark rate, which dictates borrowing costs and currently stands at 5.25%. The fall in the rate of inflation over the past few months had led many analysts to predict the Bank would begin cutting the rate from June. However, recent data on inflation - which measures the pace at which prices are rising - has shown it is not falling as quickly as expected. The latest inflation figure showed prices rose by 3.2% in the year to March , which was down from 3.4% the month before but still slightly higher than expected. Events in the US have also been affecting markets. US inflation has also not fallen as quickly as predicted, pushing back expectations about when the central bank there, the Federal Reserve, will begin cutting rates. The possibility of a delay to US interest rate cuts has affected markets globally, and is another factor feeding through to higher mortgage costs.

115,Wind farm misses deadline for electricity sale scheme,"Energy giant SSE says a massive wind farm proposed for the east coast has missed a bidding deadline due to Scottish ministers not granting approval. The deadline passed on Friday for submissions to a UK government scheme to sell electricity from the project into the National Grid, with the next round of bids not until 2025. SSE is still awaiting a decision over the Berwick Bank project in the outer Firth of Forth, which could create more than 4,000 jobs. The news came as the Scottish government gave the go-ahead for the world’s largest floating wind farm near Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, which will primarily be used to power oil and gas platforms. Green Volt bosses said the project would place Scotland ""at the leading edge of a new floating wind sector"". Green Volt will provide 560MW of energy, while Berwick Bank would be one of the largest offshore wind developments in the world, generating up to 4.1GW of electricity - enough to power all of Scotland's homes twice over. SSE Renewables had targeted Berwick Bank to be generating power by the end of the decade. It is understood any further delay could impact the Scottish government's aim to build 11GW of new offshore wind by 2030. Net Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan last week told the Scottish parliament that an interim target to reduce carbon emissions by 75% by 2030 had been dropped due to the goal being ""out of reach"". The announcement resulted in the Scottish Greens clashing with the SNP, with the Greens to hold an extraordinary general meeting over the future of the power-sharing Bute House Agreement. This is yet more criticism of the Scottish government's climate change commitments with the massive Berwick Bank project still unsure of its future. They had been hoping to know by now whether they had consent from ministers who'd said they ""aim"" to make decisions on these large projects within 12 months.  It's now been 17. Consent times have become a huge issue for the industry.  Another project - GreenVolt - submitted its application a month after Berwick Bank but it has now been given the go-ahead. Making comparisons is difficult though.  Berwick Bank is much larger and is in a more sensitive area of sea close to where RSPB Scotland previously took ministers to court over the impact of turbines on migrating birds. What this is really about though is targets.  Again.  This time a pledge to build 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.  At 4.1GW, Berwick Bank makes up a huge chunk of that. SSE isn't saying yet that they can't be generating by 2030, even with this latest hold-up.  But it's leaving little room for manoeuvre. The energy giant is now pushing for a decision by the summer, well ahead of the next opportunity to bid for a government contract in 2025 BBC Scotland News understands SSE is now pushing the Scottish government for a decision to be made by early summer, having first lodged plans for the development in December 2022. A spokesperson said that a decision would let them begin ""unlocking the potential economic opportunities of offshore wind in Scotland."" SSE said approval would let it also grow ""the domestic supply chain"" and deliver against both Scottish and UK offshore wind targets. An estimated 4,650 jobs could be created if Berwick Bank goes ahead. UK energy minister Andrew Bowie told the Times newspaper any further delays would “put at risk the goal to get to net zero by 2050”. Six projects have been approved as part of the Innovation and Target Oil and Gas leasing round from Crown Estate Scotland. This includes the Green Volt development, which will consist of up to 35 turbines generating half a gigawatt of electricity. Any excess energy not consumed by offshore installations will be fed into the National Grid and it is hoped the project would be operational by 2029. First minister Humza Yousaf said the news showed Scotland ""is one of the best places in the world to develop offshore wind and its supply chain."" Aberdeen-based businessman Sir Ian Wood, who chairs the North Sea net zero transition firm ETZ, claimed the project ""sends a huge signal"" to investors that Scotland is a pioneer in offshore wind technologies.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl5kvq85ye1o,business
116,UPS's road to carbon neutrality,"Laura Lane, UPS's chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer, enters the BBC's Executive Lounge to discuss how the massive logistics company isn't waiting for the perfect electric lorry. While your online purchases are on the road, Laura Lane is keeping on an eye on the impact of the journey. As UPS's chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer, Lane is working to trim the emissions of the logistics firm, which is responsible for delivering 22 million packages every day across more than 200 countries and territories. Most of these deliveries are driven on a fleet of 125,000 package cars, vans, lorries and motorcycles, or flown on a fleet of around 500 leased, owned and chartered aircraft. The combined emissions from all these vehicles add up. According to UPS data seen by the BBC, its air and ground operations produced a total of 14 million tonnes of CO2 or equivalent emissions in 2023. Lane isn't content to simply wait for the perfect solution, be that an emissions-free aircraft fuel or a fully battery-electric lorry. She's figuring out the answer as she goes – and the vast amount of data collected by UPS is critical to reaching the company's sustainability targets. ""UPS is an engineering company and a technology company at its foundation,"" Lane tells the BBC, ""and so we're always looking for efficiencies. And efficiencies equal sustainability."" So far, UPS is finding success. In 2023, it logged an 8.1% decrease in Scope 1 emissions (pollution UPS produces directly), Scope 2 emissions (pollution from sources like electricity UPS uses to power its facilities) and Scope 3 emissions (pollution associated with the company's suppliers and customers use of UPS' services). That's an improvement from 6.9% the previous year. Lane, who joined UPS as its president of global public affairs in 2011 – and previously served as a US trade negotiator, a US foreign service diplomat and an executive at both Time Warner and Citigroup – talked to the BBC about how the logistics company is setting itself up to meet its alternative-fuel goals early. UPS is a massive organisation, and I imagine it's very easy to get lost in all the data you collect on sustainability measures. How do you decide what's most important to tackle right now? We are a big organisation, so we have a responsibility to track the data. We have clear-cut processes for tracking all of our important data, including our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. All of the data is auditable by our outside firms, and we've set up a really good process so that we now have at our fingertips dashboards that tell us how we're doing as a global organisation, as well as by country. The most amazing thing is that we have sustainability data at package-level detail. Our Orion routing system optimises every route, no matter where a package is coming into our network and where it needs to be delivered. We use all of that data to minimise miles driven to get the greatest fuel efficient, smartest route for every package. We're known for making right turns [to improve efficiency and safety]. The bottom line is that the greenest mile is the mile not driven. Orion and a lot of the data we use are driving those outcomes. One of UPS's goals is to have 40% of its ground operations be powered by alternative fuels by 2025. Right now, you're at 28%. How will you push that initiative across the finish line, and how will data make that happen? Because of these dashboards, we can optimise utilisation of alternative-fuel vehicles in our network with the infrastructure that we have. Two offices down from mine is where the head of US operations [Nando Cesarone] works. We just showed him the places where we can deliver better for our customers at lower cost and an emissions reduction if we run more renewable natural gas-fuelled tractor trailers. We have 18,000 alternative-fuel vehicles in our network now. He just approved a new order of around 1,000 alternative fuel tractor-trailers for 2024. These are long-mileage ones. A lot of our competitors focus on last-mile delivery with their package cars. My goal, and the company's goal, is to maximise every dollar spent for maximum emissions reduction. And the reality is, you can do more by focusing on long haul. The head of US operations has also approved next year's purchases. My model, which adds those capabilities into our network, shows that we are going to hit our 2025 goal on deadline with a little room to spare. More from Executive Lounge: UPS is one of the largest users of natural gas fuel, but that isn't carbon neutral. Its carbon footprint is about half that of coal. Why not simply transition to zero-emission vehicles entirely? The reality of the market. At our investor conference, we showed one of our beautiful electric tractor-trailers. We're ready to buy. Do you know how many we've been able to take delivery on? Ten. I have thousands of vehicles on the road. If I waited for enough electric vehicles to be produced, along with the infrastructure to support them, I'd be waiting a very long time. That's the reality. I know there's technology right now that can cut my emissions dramatically. Why not spend the money now while I'm waiting for some of these electric options? I'd rather, for example, be looking at opportunities to do tailpipe emissions capture on our lower-emissions vehicles. We're trying lots of different options, because we don't think that the future is going to be 100% electric for a very long time. With all of the geopolitical aspects to this, there could be a lot of supply-chain challenges in terms of producing electric vehicles at the scale needed for a company like ours. I can't wait for when there will be enough. I've got to be solving the problem now. One of UPS's goals is carbon neutrality by 2050 – You're going to ask why we didn't promise net-zero emissions by 2050? I'm going to tell you why. UPS values integrity, safety and financially sound and smart engineering. Right now, the challenge is decarbonising our air operations. Around 60% to 65% of our emissions come from air, and we couldn't with integrity, based on the current science and technology, say we could get to net zero. UPS has never shied away from any challenge. We're always trying to figure out how we can solve engineering problems. We're looking at a lot of different ways to join with other companies as part of buyers' alliances. We're working with governments to accelerate market incentives to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale, and at price that don't hurt small or medium-sized businesses. And we're in partnership with Beta Technologies for eVTOL – an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle – to do shorter runs with 1,200-pound payloads. UPS is undergoing around a billion dollars in cost reductions right now. How do you maintain all this forward-looking research and innovation when your leadership team is interested in cutting costs? I'm part of the leadership team, so I was in the room as we were making those decisions. Here's what's beautiful: sustainability isn't this function that's off to the side. It's a mindset here at UPS. While we have reduced some of our workforce, it's because we've right sized our company to match the volume and needs of our customers. Sustainability has not been an afterthought in that equation. It's central to it.

117,First-time buyers face toughest test for 70 years,"First-time buyers are facing the toughest conditions in 70 years to buy a home, according to a report by the Building Societies Association (BSA). Those buying a first home were increasingly reliant on having two high incomes or receiving parental support, it said. Others have been priced out and ""stuck"" in renting from private landlords. Building societies account for a quarter of mortgage lending, and their association suggests the market needs to change to allow more people to buy a home. Mortgage rates are relatively high compared with the last decade, and the cost of renting has also soared. Latest official figures showed private rental costs in the UK have risen by 9.2% in the last year. The BSA's report, written by housing analyst Neal Hudson, suggests home ownership among younger people has been in decline over the last 20 years. First-time buyers faced the dual affordability struggle of raising a deposit to buy a home as well as paying a mortgage. Although the cost of a deposit had been difficult for some time, the recent increases in mortgage interest rates had tightened the squeeze, the report said. Paul Broadhead, head of mortgage and housing policy at the BSA, said: ""Becoming a first-time buyer is possibly the most expensive it has been over at least the last 70 years, but a properly functioning housing market is dependent on first-time buyers being able to afford their first home. ""New thinking and radical changes are needed."" At present, buying a home required two above-average incomes, the report said. House price growth has been higher than earnings growth for some time. Separate figures published on Monday by the property portal Rightmove suggest much of the activity in the housing market since the start of the year was among large, four-bedroom homes. They will be out of reach for the vast majority of first-time buyers, but Rightmove also said asking prices were starting to accelerate again. A number of mortgage lenders have also started the week by raising the interest rates on new fixed-rate deals. They are responding to a view on the markets that the Bank of England may not lower the benchmark interest rate as early or as often as previously thought. The Resolution Foundation think tank recently said that the most common living arrangement for an adult aged between 18 and 34 in 1997 was being in a couple with children, but now it was living with your parents. Half of first-time buyers in their 20s were getting help of an average of £25,000 from their parents, it said. In January, Sir Howard Davies, who chairs NatWest, was criticised for suggested it was not ""that difficult"" to get on the housing ladder. He later said he meant access to mortgages was easier. But the BSA report suggested otherwise, and argued that more ""flexibility"" was required on regulation such as the limits on lending when borrowers can only pay a small deposit. Wider issues are facing first-time buyers, such as concerns over rising house prices in rural areas. The County Councils Network said house prices in rural counties were the most unaffordable outside London. Sophie Brown, who rents in the Cotswolds, told the BBC in March that she was priced out of buying in the area. ""A lot of people are coming from London with their second homes ... pricing out the normal everyday person with a normal job,"" she said. ""Local people are having issues trying to buy houses."" The BSA said whichever government was in power after the general election should commission a review of the first-time buyer market and use all its powers to help those wanting to buy their first home. Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later. Move to an interest-only mortgage. It can keep your monthly payments affordable although you won't be paying off the debt accrued when purchasing your house. Extend the life of your mortgage. The typical mortgage term is 25 years, but 30 and even 40-year terms are now available. Read more here",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87zgx42m5go,business
118,Thames Water makes bid to lift bills by up to 44%,"Thames Water is attempting to persuade the regulator to let it raise consumer bills by up to 44% over the next five years by increasing investment. The heavily indebted water firm aims to spend at least £1.1bn more on environmental measures. Regulator Ofwat had dismissed the company's original proposal, leading to questions over the firm's future. Thames's huge debts have led to speculation it could be taken over by the government. Thames is the UK's largest water company, with 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region. However, it currently has debts of about £15.4bn and it has also come under fierce criticism for water leaks and sewage spillages. Thames had originally proposed investing £18.7bn between 2025 and 2030 and increasing customer bills by 40%, on top of inflation, over the five-year period. Ofwat dismissed this plan, prompting shareholders at Thames' parent company, Kemble Water, to withdraw a proposed cash injection and default on debt interest payments . Thames has now proposed spending an extra £1.1bn on top of its original plans on ""projects benefiting the environment"", although it did not give details of what these would be. The new total investment of £19.8bn would still require customer bills to rise by 40%, reaching an annual average bill of £608.30 by 2029-30. But Thames also said it could potentially increase investment by another £1.9bn, although that would lead to average bills rising by 44% to £627. Thames is by no means the only water company planning big prices rises over the next few years. In plans put before Ofwat in October last year, Southern Water proposed a 66% price rise on top of inflation, while Severn Trent put forward a 37% increase. Mike Keil, interim chief executive at the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""On the surface, the proposal for more investment from Thames Water is a positive step for its customers that have endured some of the worst customer service in the sector."" However, he added that only 16% of its customers thought the proposed bill increases in the five-year plan were affordable. ""This announcement appears to offer nothing to ease the fears of those already struggling to pay,"" he said. It is thought that a final decision from Ofwat will come at a crucial meeting on 23 May with a ""draft determination"" of what companies will be allowed to charge from next year issued on 12 June. Thames Water's operating company has reassured its 16 million customers it has enough money in the bank to continue delivering water and waste services until May of next year. Thames Water chief executive, Chris Weston, said: ""Our business plan focuses on our customers' priorities... we've now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment. ""We will continue to discuss this with our regulators and stakeholders."" The company has been under fire for its environmental record, and in recent weeks pollution levels in the River Thames have come under renewed focus. In last month's Oxford and Cambridge boat race, both crews were given safety advice to avoid swallowing water splashed up from the river. Last week, television naturalist Steve Backshall described pollution found in the river as ""toxic"" after Bangor University analysis found high levels of norovirus and E. coli in water taken near the border between Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The samples were taken downstream from Little Marlow Sewage Treatment Works, although Thames Water said all discharges from the site had been fully compliant with environmental law. Earlier this year, data from Thames Water, analysed by London's City Hall , showed the number of hours in which sewage was dumped into the River Thames more than quadrupled last year. Analysts say Thames Water's current debt amounts to about 80% of the value of the business, making it the most heavily indebted of England and Wales' water companies. A large proportion of its debt was added when Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank, owned Thames, with its debts standing above £10bn when the company was sold in 2017. Macquarie said it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's infrastructure, but critics have argued it took billions out of the company in loans and dividends . Thames Water says it has not paid dividends to external shareholders since 2017. However, dividends can also be used to move money around businesses owned by one parent company. Thames Water has paid over £200m in dividends to other companies within the group in the past five years.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68872563,business
119,What are smart motorways and are they dangerous?,"The technology used to manage England's smart motorways has stopped working hundreds of times, the BBC's Panorama has found. The government announced last year that it will stop building new stretches of these roads, following concerns about cost and safety. Smart motorways were designed to ease traffic flow, with some using the hard shoulder as an extra lane. Technology is used to regulate traffic flow and ease congestion. As of April 2024 there were 396 miles of smart motorways in England: All three types of smart motorway use overhead gantries to direct drivers. Variable speed limits, controlled by speed cameras, manage traffic flow when there is congestion, or if there is a hazard ahead. On dynamic motorways, the overhead gantries also tell drivers whether or not they can drive on the hard shoulder. A red X is displayed if a lane is closed, for example, because of an accident or breakdown. Traffic is monitored using CCTV. All-lane-running schemes operate in the same way, except there is no hard shoulder at all. If drivers get into trouble, they are meant to aim for emergency refuge areas (essentially lay-bys) at intervals along the road. Motorways in general account for far fewer casualties than rural or urban roads. And National Highways, which manages England's motorways, says the latest data shows that ""smart motorways are our safest roads"". However, the removal of the hard shoulder on some smart motorways has concerned critics. If a vehicle breaks down, or if there is an accident, vehicles can be left stranded and emergency services may struggle to get through. National Highways' latest figures suggest that if you break down on a smart motorway without a hard shoulder you are three times more likely to be killed or seriously injured than on one with a hard shoulder. Across all smart motorways, radar and cameras are supposed to spot broken-down vehicles, and warning signs are then supposed to close affected lanes. However, in April, figures obtained by Panorama revealed hundreds of incidents when crucial safety equipment was out of action. National Highways says radar detects 89% of stopped vehicles - but that means one in 10 is not spotted. At least 79 people have been killed on smart motorways since they were introduced in 2010. In the past five years, seven coroners have called for them to be made safer. In 2021, MPs on the Transport Committee said they were ""not convinced"" that the benefits of all-lane-running motorways were enough to justify the safety risks of permanently removing the hard shoulder. Then, in January 2022, the rollout of new stretches of all-lane-running was paused for five years, in order to collect more information and make existing schemes safer. Ministers have since gone further, and in 2023 cancelled the building of new smart motorways - this included 11 schemes that were already on pause and three earmarked for construction. However, work on some stretches of smart motorway that were near completion were allowed to continue. In 2020, the government promised to build more emergency refuges - safety lay-bys that motorists can use if they are in trouble. Although 150 are supposed to be built by next year, only 13 have been completed so far. National Highways says a further 34 refuges are under construction. The government says it is also spending £900m on technology to make the existing network safer, but there are no plans to put back the hard shoulder.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59134013,business
120,Farmers hold 'tractor run' in pylon protest,"Aberdeenshire farmers have held a protest against proposals which would see a new network of electricity pylons run through part of the region. SSEN's East Coast project includes plans for a new substation and overhead power lines between the villages of Kintore in Aberdeenshire and Tealing in Angus. On Sunday, 25 farmers took their tractors along a 15-mile stretch of the proposed network, calling the plans ""devastating"". SSEN said the work was necessary to meet climate change targets. The ""tractor run"" travelled through Durris, Drumoak, Echt and Dunecht to Leylodge near Kintore, where a new substation is set to be built. Supporters also lined part of the route. Eileen West from the campaign group Deeside Against Pylons said it would be ""difficult"" for the farmers to work around the pylons. She added: ""They'll have to be very careful about their own safety, of their machinery going around them. ""They all turned up on a pretty grim day, the farmers are all behind on their crops, but for them to turn up on a day like this shows the appetite for protest."" Plans were overturned last year that would have seen the pylons located across land at the heart of the classic novel Sunset Song. Residents in the area objected to the original plans on both environmental and cultural grounds. In a statement SSEN Transmission said: ""The Kintore-Tealing 400kV overhead line project is part of a GB-wide upgrade of the electricity transmission network that is required to deliver energy security and net zero. ""We are committed to work with all stakeholders to minimise and mitigate environmental, community and land use impacts.""",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c88zk2z70r0o,business
121,How Chinese firms are using Mexico as a backdoor to the US,"The reclining armchairs and plush leather sofas coming off the production line at Man Wah Furniture's factory in Monterrey are 100% ""Made in Mexico"". They're destined for large retailers in the US, like Costco and Walmart. But the company is from China, its Mexican manufacturing plant built with Chinese capital. The triangular relationship between the US, China and Mexico is behind the buzzword in Mexican business: nearshoring. Man Wah is one of scores of Chinese companies to relocate to industrial parks in northern Mexico in recent years, to bring production closer to the US market. As well as saving on shipping, their final product is considered completely Mexican - meaning Chinese firms can avoid the US tariffs and sanctions imposed on Chinese goods amid the continuing trade war between the two countries. As the company's general manager, Yu Ken Wei, shows me around its vast site, he says the move to Mexico has made economic and logistical sense. ""We hope to triple or even quadruple production here,"" he says in perfect Spanish. ""The intention here in Mexico is to bring production up to the level of our operation in Vietnam."" The firm only arrived in the city of Monterrey in 2022, but already employs 450 people in Mexico. Yu Ken Wei says they hope to grow to more than 1,200 employees, operating several new lines at the plant in the coming years. ""People here in Mexico are very hardworking and fast learners,"" says Mr Yu. ""We've got good operators, and their productivity is high. So, on the labour side, I think Mexico is strategically very good too."" Certainly, nearshoring is considered to be providing an important shot in the arm to the Mexican economy - by June of last year, Mexico's total exports had risen 5.8% from a year earlier to $52.9bn (£42.4bn). The trend is showing few signs of slowing down. In just two months of this year, there were announcements of capital investment in Mexico of almost half of the annual total back in 2020. The Man Wah sofa factory is located inside Hofusan, a Chinese-Mexican industrial park. Demand for its plots is sky high: every available space has been sold. In fact, the Industrial Parks Association of Mexico say every site due to be built in the country by 2027 has already been bought up. Little wonder many Mexican economists say China's interest in the country is no passing fad. ""The structural reasons that are bringing capital to Mexico are here to stay,"" says Juan Carlos Baker Pineda, Mexico's former vice-minister for external trade. ""I have no indication that the trade war between China and the US is going to diminish any time soon."" Mr Baker Pineda was part of Mexico's negotiating team for the new North American free trade agreement, USMCA. ""While the Chinese origin of the capital coming into Mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries,"" he says, ""according to international trade legislation, those products are, to all intents and purposes, Mexican"". That has given Mexico an obvious strategic foothold between the two superpowers: Mexico recently replaced China as t he US's main trading partner, a significant and symbolic change. Mexico's increased trade with the US has also come about in part through a second key aspect of nearshoring in the country: US firms setting up Mexican facilities too, sometimes after relocating production from factories in Asia. Perhaps the standout announcement came from Elon Musk last year, when he unveiled plans for a new Tesla Gigafactory outside Monterrey. However, the electric car company is yet to break ground on the $10bn plant. And, while Tesla is apparently still committed to the project, it has slowed its plans amid concerns over the global economy, and recent job cuts at the carmaker. But regarding Chinese investment, some urge caution over Mexico being drawn into the wider geopolitical struggle between the US and China. ""The old rich guy in town, the US, is having problems with the new rich guy in town, China,"" says Enrique Dussel of the Centre for China-Mexico Studies at the National Autonomous University in Mexico. ""And Mexico - under previous administrations, and in this one - doesn't have a strategy vis-à-vis this new triangular relationship."" With elections looming on both sides of the US-Mexico border, there may be new political considerations ahead. But whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden in the White House over the next four years, few expect any improvement in US-China relations. Mr Dussel thinks nearshoring is better defined by what he calls ""security-shoring"", saying Washington has placed national security concerns above all other factors in its relationship with China. Mexico, he argues, must be wary of being caught in the middle. Amid this tension, Mr Dussel says: ""Mexico is putting up a big sign to China saying: 'Welcome to Mexico!'. You don't need a PhD to know that this isn't going to end well for bilateral relations between the US and Mexico in the medium term,"" he adds. Others are more optimistic. ""In my mind, the question is not if this trend will continue, but rather how much of this trend can we take advantage of,"" says former Mexican trade official, Juan Carlos Baker Pineda. ""I'm sure people are having these same discussions in Colombia, in Vietnam, in Costa Rica. So, we need to make sure in Mexico that those conditions that are aligned by themselves go hand-in-hand with corporate and government decisions to sustain that trend in the long term."" Back in Monterrey, the talented Mexican seamstresses at Man Wah Furniture put the finishing touches to another sofa before it's shipped north. When an American family buys it at a Walmart store near them, they may have little idea of the complex geopolitics underpinning its production. But whether nearshoring is a clever back door to the US, or part of a costly war between superpowers, it's currently Mexico's key advantage in these hostile times of global trade.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68825118,business
122,"Payout numbers for force-fit energy meters unacceptable, says energy secretary","The number of compensation payouts made to people wrongly put onto prepayment meters is ""completely unacceptable"", the energy secretary has said. Just 1,500 out of 150,000 people assessed have had financial redress from energy suppliers who forced-fitted the meters into their homes. Claire Coutinho said she had spoken to the regulator to sort compensation payouts ""as soon as possible"". But energy suppliers only believe about 2,500 people require compensation. Energy regulator Ofgem confirmed that about 150,000 cases had been ""reviewed"" so far by suppliers themselves, who have decided that just over 2,500 customers were entitled to payouts. Some 1,502 customers have been paid initial compensation payments totalling £342,450 between them, with suppliers setting aside a further £200,000 for another 1,000. Ofgem told all energy suppliers to review cases of people who were forced onto prepayment meters between the start of 2022 and the end of January 2023 to assess whether they required compensation. However, the regulator told the BBC that British Gas, the supplier found to be hiring agents who forced their way into the homes of vulnerable people to fit prepayment meters, against Ofgem rules , was not included in the compensation figures released so far. It said the supplier was not included in its review and was subject to a separate, ongoing investigation. The exposure of the practice in which vulnerable people had their homes broken into for meters to be fitted led to a public outcry. Asked on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg if the government was ""abandoning"" thousands of people due to the small number of compensation payouts to date, Ms Coutinho replied: ""No, absolutely not."" She said the situation was ""completely unacceptable"", adding she had spoken to Ofgem, who are overseeing compensation, to ""make sure that people can get the compensation as quickly as possible"". ""We're getting new figures in the coming months but we are ready to act to make sure that people can get that money,"" she added. Ofgem told the BBC it was working with suppliers to ""make sure they identify all eligible consumers and pay appropriate levels of compensation promptly"". It said it expected to update the number of cases where redress has been paid to customers by the end of June. The amounts paid to individual customers so far from each supplier varies, Ofgem said, adding that companies had compensated customers in different ways, including sending cheques, adding credit to the accounts, and writing off debt. Energy UK, the body which represents energy suppliers, told the BBC that companies had ""identified a small proportion of cases where the correct process wasn't followed and where the customers affected are being compensated as a result"". It said with energy debt at ""record levels"", prepayment meters had an ""important role to play in preventing customers falling further into arrears"". It said new rules mean there ""stronger safeguards"" in place governing forced meter installations, which it said ""will only take place after repeated attempts to contact the customer and a visit to the property to confirm suitability"". ""The Code of Practice also identifies those categories of vulnerable customers who will be exempt from any prepayment meter installation,"" a spokesperson added. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, either through accounts or by adding credit to a card in a convenience store or Post Office. About four million households have such meters in the UK. There are three types - key meters, smart card meters and smart prepayment meters. The first two work in a very similar way. They are most common in rented properties and having one is a more expensive method of paying for energy than by direct debit, but is sometimes the only option for people who have struggled to pay and are in debt to an energy supplier. For years, energy companies were able to force-fit prepayment meters into homes when bills went unpaid. This can be done remotely on a smart meter, or physically after a firm has been given a warrant to do so. The practice was halted when British Gas was exposed last year, but various suppliers have recently been given permission to resume the forced fitting of prepayment meters under stricter rules. Strict rules also apply that prevent energy suppliers moving an at-risk customer onto a prepayment meter if they are struggling to pay.

123,Elfbar: Vape firm claims it will survive UK disposable ban,"The company behind two of the UK's most popular vape brands says new reusable versions leave it ""well-equipped"" to deal with the upcoming ban on disposables, despite concerns over producers exploiting ""loopholes"". Elfbar and Lost Mary have already launched reusable versions of their popular disposable vapes. Elfbar said it was ""addressing demand"" for a tool to help smokers quit. But critics say the vapes will not achieve the ban's environmental aims. Councils have also warned that the UK government should not let producers exploit ""loopholes"" in the ban. Green Fun Alliance is one of the main distributors in the UK of Elfbar and Lost Mary, which together account for nearly half of the British market. It is owned by low-profile Chinese entrepreneur Shengwei Zhang, 51, who also controls the companies that make Elfbar and Lost Mary vapes. The latest accounts for Green Fun Alliance show that its sales have skyrocketed as disposable vapes rose in popularity - almost tripling to £117.3m for the year to 31 January 2023. In a filing with Companies House, Green Fun Alliance noted the government's plans to ban them from next April ""will have a detrimental effect on sales and profitability"". ""However, management have been preparing for this and are well equipped to pivot their business to the exclusive sale of non-disposable vapes and related products,"" it said. Some signs of Elfbar and Lost Mary's future plans are already visible. In the past 12 months, they have launched reusable versions of their disposable vapes. The main difference is that the liquid which contains the nicotine comes in a replaceable pod, and a USB port at the bottom allows the battery to be recharged. It means the body of the vape can be reused. A spokesperson for Elfbar said: ""We are continuing to diversify our product lines by providing viable alternatives to single-use devices, addressing the demand for a harm reduction tool that is helping to assist millions of adults [to quit smoking]."" But critics contend that the new vapes will not deliver the environmental benefits which a ban was intended to bring. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, was one of the leading voices calling for the ban . A spokesperson said: ""The incoming ban on disposable vapes must ensure that the definition of disposable is locked down, and avoids the potential for producers to exploit loopholes, including producers adding a USB port to disposable vapes to bypass these restrictions."" Scott Butler, executive director of Material Focus, a non-profit organisation set up tackle electrical waste, noted the growing trend of vapes using pods. ""This switch may have negligible environmental impact as these are still items which are low priced and easy to throw away,"" he said. Elfbar's biggest rival, Chinese government-controlled SKE , has launched a similar reusable version of its most popular product, Crystal Bar. It did not respond to a request for comment. Green Fun Alliance acts as a distributor for Elfbar and Lost Mary products in the UK, handling sales to convenience stores and independent vape shops. Sales of Elfbar to supermarkets are handled via its UK-based master distributors, companies such as Supreme PLC and Totally Wicked. Green Fun Alliance made a profit of £8.3m, up from £1.9m the year before, and paid a dividend of £2m. That is likely to be just a small proportion of Shengwei Zhang's profits from vape sales in the UK.",2024-04-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68846030,business
124,"Look, no hands! My trip on Seoul's self-driving bus","There is a moment on the A21 bus, at around midnight, when the man in the driver's seat presses a small red button on his dashboard. He smiles, then lets go of the steering wheel and lifts his feet from the pedals. The vehicle continues to glide through the streets of South Korea's capital, Seoul, turning corners and stopping at traffic lights. No-one on board seems to notice. ""One day all the buses in Seoul will be driverless,"" says Park Sang-uk, head of operations at SUM (Smart YoUr Mobility). His company has spent the past four years developing the city's new self-driving night bus, which authorities say is the first of its kind anywhere in the world. These kinds of buses and cars are known as autonomous vehicles or AVs. ""There are fewer and fewer people who want to drive buses, especially at night,"" Mr Park says. ""This is the perfect solution to help fill that void."" The quiet night-time roads are also the ideal place to test the technology, which is still far from perfect. There are some safety measures on board. For example, passengers have to be sitting down and must wear a seatbelt at all times. There is also someone in the driver's seat, who can take control of the bus in case something goes wrong. Soon, Mr Park insists, there won't be any need for that. The journey is mostly smooth. It took us past the glowing storefronts of the city centre and then into the capital's more dimly-lit residential neighbourhoods - stopping about 20 times on the way. At first, looking at the steering wheel moving by itself, then seeing the bus ghost to the left and right accordingly, is enough to fill you with trepidation. But soon that feeling passes. Having said that, there are a couple of times when the driver has to take the wheel and hit the brakes. These sudden jolts are a reminder that human drivers are on the road and the artificial intelligence (AI) controlling the bus is not prepared for every eventuality. Most passengers were fairly relaxed though. ""I was excited to try this,"" said one student on his way home from university. ""The fact that it's a late-night bus also means it can reduce the burden on drivers."" ""I had no idea this was a driverless bus!"" said one woman who had just finished work. ""You really wouldn't know."" Another student, visiting from the Netherlands, seemed a little less convinced: ""I was a bit nervous getting onboard. Seeing the driver sitting there did reassure me a bit."" The US-based Society of Automotive Engineers categorises AVs from Level 1 to 5. Level 1, the most basic, relates to vehicles with features such as cruise control, while Level 5 is a fully-automated vehicle that can operate under any conditions and in any situation. These do not currently exist. Seoul's new night bus is a Level 3 vehicle, which means that some human intervention is required in certain situations. The most advanced AVs operating at the moment are in China and the United States, passengers can take a Level 4 taxi in Beijing, and parts of California and Arizona. These cars have no safety driver but must stick to certain roads and routes. How far self-driving technology can actually advance is up for debate. Without a complete overhaul of how our cities function some experts doubt whether truly autonomous vehicular traffic is possible. ""The view that autonomous cars are our future is sheer science fiction"", says Graham Currie, a professor of public transport at Monash University in Melbourne. ""It's nonsense, quite frankly. On the street we have dogs, we have children, we have weather, we have other vehicles. Technology hasn't sorted all of that out yet and it may never do."" According to Professor Currie, governments are especially interested in the possibilities of autonomous public transport because the majority of the cost of a bus route is the driver's salary. Naturally, this has led to some concern among bus drivers. The trade union representing Seoul's 18,000 bus drivers told the BBC that the city government has never contacted them about its plans for an autonomous future. ""Self-driving should not replace human labour completely,"" says Yoo Jae-ho, Secretary-General of the Seoul City Bus Union. ""Right now, I don't think that's even possible - it's too dangerous."" ""If self-driving technology is ready and it can be implemented one day, then it should come along with re-education and re-hiring support programmes for the bus drivers and maintenance workers."" South Korean authorities are planning to invest more than $1bn (£810m) in projects to develop autonomous driving technologies and build related infrastructure by 2027. China is also making strides when it comes to self-driving vehicles. Last week, the ride-hailing firm Didi announced a partnership with state-owned electric vehicle manufacturer GAC Aion to mass-produce a fleet of Level 4 robotaxis. Tesla boss Elon Musk said earlier this month that his electric car maker would unveil its own robotaxi in August. However, Professor Currie argues that investing in private AVs does little to address real transport problems faced by cities. ""I don't want to be negative. I do believe it's worth experimenting with new systems,"" he said. ""But I find myself being sceptical"". ""Having thousands of autonomous cars driving around a city, often empty, is only going to make make our roads more congested - not less."" Back on the A21, we reach the end of the line.

125,Volkswagen workers vote to unionize in major win for organised labour,"Volkswagen workers in the US have voted to join the United Autoworkers Union (UAW) in a massive victory for organised labour in the US. Workers in Tennessee voted 73% in favour, according to the union's unofficial vote count on Friday night. It handed the UAW its first election win at a car factory in the American South in decades. Two prior votes at the factory, including in 2019, had failed, after stiff political opposition. But attitudes toward organised labour appear to be shifting. The US has seen an increase in strikes and petitions to join unions since the pandemic, drawing in Hollywood actors, Starbucks baristas, tech contractors, healthcare workers, and even college basketball players. Workers at the only VW factory the US, in Chattanooga, will now be represented by the union to negotiate collectively over issues such as pay and working conditions. Analysts said the outcome could inspire employees at other factories in the region to take similar steps. Another UAW election is scheduled for May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama, and the union has begun a push at other factories, as well. UAW boss Shawn Fain last year said the UAW would target 13 foreign-owned factories in the South, in a bid to bring in new members to the organisation, whose numbers have steadily dwindled. The plans aimed to seize on the momentum of the organisation's headline-drawing strike last year that won significant pay increases and other benefits for union workers at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. But it marked a risky push for the organisation, which is closely associated with the Democratic party, into a part of the country that is both staunchly Republican and historically hostile to unions. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican, was among the political leaders to speak out against the UAW effort. But unlike in 2019, when the governor addressed workers at a meeting hosted by Volkswagen, the political opposition was more muted this time and Volkswagen said it was remaining officially neutral in the fight. Before the election, analysts said the UAW had its best shot in years at winning, noting new leadership had refreshed the reputation and approach of the organisation, which had been mired in corruption scandals. UAW membership peaked in 1979 at almost 1.5 million. Today, it represents more than 400,000 active workers across a wide range of sectors, including hospitals and universities, with more than 140,000 members employed at Ford, GM and Stellantis.",2024-04-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68861396,business
126,App to cut EU border queues won't be ready in time,"An app designed to reduce disruption for Brits travelling across the Channel will not be ready in time for a new EU border scheme, the boss of Eurostar has told the BBC. Under the much-delayed Entry Exit System (EES), non-EU citizens will need to register fingerprints and a photo at the border from October. It was hoped the app developed by the EU could allow passengers to do this remotely, and prevent long queues for UK travellers. However, Eurostar boss Gwendoline Cazenave told the BBC that the rail firm was preparing for the checks to happen at stations as the app will not be ready in time. EES will replace passport stamping. It is meant to give more oversight of who is entering and leaving the EU. But there have been repeated warnings that the extra time taken for people to complete their initial registration will cause long queues at the Port of Dover, Eurostar and Eurotunnel terminals. French border police carry out checks at these sites as people depart the UK. Ms Cazenave said Eurostar had begun installing more than 49 kiosks at St Pancras in preparation for the change to EES this autumn. “It’s all about preparing the customer flow in the station, and to have as many staff as possible, as [much] space for the customers to cross the border in a seamless way,” she said. The Eurostar boss said the app would make things smoother, and while the EU had said it would launch EES without it, “we’re sure they will deploy it soon”. EU border system should be delayed - P&O director Warning EU border system has lasting 'negative impacts' The Port of Dover is expected to have particular queue problems because of its constrained space, and the number of cars, coaches and lorries it handles. In March, a P&O Ferries director said the IT system should be delayed again beyond October. Eurotunnel owner Getlink is building new processing areas at Folkestone and Calais to cope with the changes. Eurostar’s passenger numbers and revenue plummeted in the pandemic, but by the end of last year the cross-Channel train operator had recovered to pre-Covid levels. It expects up to two million passengers during the Paris Olympics and Paralympics this summer. Eurostar has partnerships with Team GB, the Belgian, and the Dutch teams - and the German Olympic team. Ms Cazenave said that when London-Paris tickets went on sale in November, sales were three times the usual volume. She acknowledged Eurostar ticket prices were higher than air fares, but said it was “not the same service”, as trains delivered customers straight into city centres and there were no extra charges for things like luggage and seat reservations. She added there was also an appetite for sustainable travel.",2024-04-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vz9d8815po,business
127,Can AI help solve Japan’s labour shortages?,"A shrinking population means Japan has a shortage of workers. Many are hoping that artificial intelligence (AI) can pick up the slack. In a country that is known to be obsessed with perfection, damaged or misshapen vegetables and fruits are hard to sell. And if you are a specialist maker of Japanese dumplings, like the brand Osaka Ohsho, then selling a packet of gyoza with some damaged is a big no-no. But as demand surged during the pandemic, its parent firm, Eat&Holdings, simply didn't have enough manpower to check every single dumpling, or keep up with demand. So it turned to technology for an answer. In January 2023, it opened a high-tech factory equipped with AI-powered cameras trained to detect any faulty gyoza on the production lines. Today this facility makes two dumplings every second. That's twice the speed of the other Osaka Ohsho production sites. ""By implementing AI, we have reduced the manpower on the manufacturing line by almost 30%,"" says spokeswoman Keiko Handa. The firm has also recently launched an AI-powered cooking robot called I-Robo at one of its Tokyo restaurants. As it takes time to train chefs, the company says the technology will help with the labour shortage issue. Japan's labour shortfall is only likely to get worse. The current population of 124.35 million has been falling for 13 years. And Japan's labour force is expected to continue to decline by 12% from 2022 to 2040, by which time it is estimated that the country will lack 11 million workers . Meanwhile, Asia's second-biggest economy is already home to the world's oldest population, with 29% of people aged 65 or above. The country also has one of the lowest birth-rates in the world, with only 758,631 babies born last year. That is the smallest number since records began in the 19th century. The government's efforts to boost its birth rates have met with little success . In the words of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, his country is ""on the brink of not being able to function"". Since AI took the world by storm, many have asked if our jobs will be stolen. But for some in Japan, AI cannot arrive fast enough. Farming is one of the fastest-ageing industries in the country, with the average age of a Japanese farmer now standing at 68.4 years. Here AI is being used to identify different types of diseases, pests and weeds for early detection and prevention. Nihon Nohyaku, which manufactures agricultural chemicals, has developed a smartphone app called Nichino AI. When a farmer takes a picture of struggling crops, the app gives a diagnosis of what is wrong and which pesticide may be needed. ""The accuracy rate is about 70 to 80%, so it is not as good as real experts, but better than ordinary farmers,"" says Kentarou Taniguchi from Nihon Nohyaku. ""The longer we work on this app, the more we realise how excellent the human experts are,"" he explains. ""But the number of experts is falling, so that is where AI tools can come in handy."" Farmer Kensuke Takahashi, who has been using the app for three years, agrees that AI is one of the tools that will help modernise the sector. ""The number of farmers is falling sharply like a rollercoaster,"" he says, ""but Japan's total amount of produce is increasing."" Mr Takahashi acknowledges that there are older farmers who may be sceptical of any new technologies such as AI, but he believes they are helping to increase efficiency levels. ""Once you try out a drone to spray pesticide, you cannot go back to manual spraying,"" he laughs. What about a sector that has always faced a shortage - language teachers? Despite the government's repeated efforts to increase the number of English speakers, Japan has constantly ranked low in English proficiency, due to the lack of teachers who can effectively speak the language. To try to overcome this shortfall, a start-up called Equmenopolis has developed an AI-powered online tool that allows users to have English conversations with its avatar for 15 minutes per session. It has so far been introduced at 50 schools across the country. At Narita Kokusai High School, on the outskirts of Tokyo, students were asked to use it at home to practice for three months at the end of last year. ""AI decides what kind of English conversations each student can have and varies its questions,"" teacher Shoko Takiguchi tells the BBC. ""It is difficult to have one-on-one conversations with every student so that was an advantage."" At the end of each conversation, students get feedback in six areas including pronunciation, grammar, fluency and vocabulary. ""With AI, it is easy to find out what my weakness was, so it was efficient,"" says one of the students, Ko Hanyuan. But asked if he would choose AI over his online tutorial, he says no. Why? It lacks the human touch. Ms Takiguchi agrees: ""It is useful to improve your speaking skills, but I found conversations to be unnatural."" She adds that the AI is unable to assess the user's reaction, physical condition, or change in tone. So it won't replace human teachers? ""AI can not and should not replace English lessons at school or teachers,"" emphasises the school's principal Katsutoshi Fukumizu. Governments in Japan are also experimenting with AI. Faced with labour shortages, Yokosuka City in Kanagawa prefecture has starting using AI chatbot ChatGPT to help with administrative tasks such as transcribing and summarising meetings. ""We deal with enormous amount of documents, and it takes a very long time and effort to create those documents,"" says the city's spokesperson Kohei Ota. Thanks to ChatGPT, ""we have calculated after our trial that we save 22,700 hours of work annually,"" he adds. At the national government's Digital Agency, which was established in 2021 to overcome inefficiency in public administration, AI is also used to train its staff. ""There are so many things that we want to do, but our manpower hasn't been able to keep up,"" says Masanori Kusunoki from the agency. He adds that the government is trying to ""explore how we can use AI, and spread the information"" to the private sector. But Mr Kusunoki doesn't think that the rise of AI will mean fewer workers are needed. In a country where changes happen slowly, Japan is embracing the power of AI with less reluctance than others. That is because it has looked into every possible solution to tackle the double whammy of an ageing and shrinking population for more than a decade: from robots, to women, the elderly and foreign workers. While AI may help increase the efficiency of the workforce, it is nowhere near ready to replace human workers.",2024-04-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68225115,business
128,"Jailed bankers ruling could hit key loan rate, warn founders","The founders of a key European interest rate benchmark have said its accuracy could be affected as result of a ""deep misunderstanding"" by English courts. Euribor underpins trillions of euros in loans and tracks the rate banks pay to borrow cash from each other. The Court of Appeal recently upheld the convictions of two bankers jailed for rigging Euribor and the UK's Libor. The ruling risked creating a ""permanent bias"" in the Euribor rate, its founders said. To set Euribor, banks make a daily estimate of the interest rate they would pay to borrow a large sum of euros - then an average is taken. The Court of Appeal ruled that when publishing daily estimates of the cost of borrowing cash, banks must select the cheapest rate at which cash could be borrowed or lent. As a result, it rejected the appeals of Carlo Palombo and Tom Hayes, two former traders who were prosecuted and jailed for ""manipulating"" Euribor and Libor. The evidence against them were requests they had made of colleagues to publish ""high"" or ""low"" estimates of the cost of borrowing cash, depending on what would help their banks' trades. However, the founders of Euribor - Helmut Konrad, Nikolaus Bömcke and Jean-Pierre Ravisé - said that was exactly what banks and their traders were expected to do when they set up the benchmark nearly 30 years ago and wrote the code of conduct. They warned that if banks followed the judges' ruling, it would favour one group of investors over another. They said that each day, it would be in the interests of some of the banks to publish a lower estimate of the cost of borrowing cash, in case it might nudge the Euribor average rate in their favour. But it would also be in the interests of other banks to publish a higher estimate. Those commercially influenced quotes would balance each other out, said Mr Konrad, Mr Bömcke and Mr Ravisé. They said that the ruling requiring cash traders to put in the lowest rate on offer in the market would remove that balancing effect, creating a biased Euribor rate. ""If every bank would just put in the lowest rate, the Euribor rate would be biased - and very much so, every day - in favour of those banks who need a low Euribor.  And those who did not benefit from a low rate would be losing out - permanently,' said Mr Konrad, who led the steering committee which founded Euribor in 1997. In a statement, the three founders said: ""We deeply regret that, due to a deep misunderstanding by the UK courts of the rules we have set up for Euribor, traders have been convicted and given long jail sentences, even though they acted exactly as we, the founders of Euribor, had expected they could. ""We have issued this statement in the hope of bringing justice to these traders, whose lives have been ruined by their flawed convictions.""",2024-04-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68856399,business
129,Post Office lawyer 'missed' key Horizon finding,"A top Post Office lawyer has said he and others ""missed"" a key finding in 2014 that it was possible to remotely access Horizon software. Rodric Williams told the Post Office inquiry that repeated assurances this was not possible had been inaccurate. This included assurances to independent investigators and the BBC. A key assertion in Horizon scandal court cases over many years was that remote access to the software was not possible. The Post Office asserted in hundreds of wrongful prosecutions that sub-postmasters must have been to blame for discrepancies in accounts. And in certain key cases, such as the landmark Bates vs Post Office, the organisation insisted that the software could not be accessed remotely. However, a report by Deloitte, which had been coordinated by Mr Williams, stated in 2014 that in fact it could be. When asked by inquiry counsel Jason Beer how Mr Williams had missed this, despite it being a key concern, he said: ""I genuinely don't recall what was happening at the time."" In trying to reconstruct his thought processes, Mr Williams said ""it's hard to explain"" why he missed it. ""It was a theoretical possibility, that had controls around it, to mitigate the risk, which was small, and was being investigated further, and so, I think off the back of that, it clearly went from my mind, because I don't recall it popping up when we were being asked later [about remote access]."" Separately, Mr Beer asked Mr Williams about alleged instructions to shred documents related to the scandal in 2013 by the then head of Post Office investigations, John Scott. This was allegedly to prevent disclosure of the documents in any court proceedings. Speaking to the inquiry in 2023 about the allegation, Mr Scott said: ""I have no recall from that period, from 10 years ago, but that is not me. That's just not me, what I would say or ask."" On Friday Mr Williams said the allegation was ""serious"" but that he didn't think any documents had been shredded - but he didn't know whether that was correct. Mr Beer asked him if there was ever any investigation by the Post Office into the shredding instruction. Mr Williams responded: ""I do not know."" Mr Beer asked whether the Post Office had considered reporting the matter to the police. Mr Williams responded: ""I don't believe so, no."" When the BBC asked the Post Office whether it had investigated this, it said that was ""a matter for the inquiry"". ""Our first priority is always to assist the inquiry in its role to establish the truth,"" a Post Office spokesperson said. ""It's for the inquiry to reach its own independent conclusions after consideration of all the evidence on the issues it is examining.""",2024-04-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68855686,business
130,Netflix: Profits soar after password sharing crackdown,"Netflix says its profits have soared in the first three months of this year, partly thanks to a crackdown on password sharing. The streaming giant said it added 9.3 million customers in the first quarter, bringing its total number of subscribers to almost 270 million. The company also said its profits in the first quarter jumped to more than $2.3bn (£1.85bn). But the firm will stop reporting key subscriber numbers from next year. Announcing the decision, the firm said in a letter to shareholders : ""In our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential"". It added that today, subscriber numbers have become ""just one component of our growth"", asking investors to focus on its profits and revenue. Its revenue for the first quarter rose by nearly 15% year-on-year to $9.37bn. The firm also credited a ""drumbeat"" of hits, such as crime drama Griselda. Some investors saw its unexpected decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers as a sign that Netflix's wave of customer growth may be coming to an end. Simon Gallagher, a former Netflix director and now principal of entertainment investment firm SPG Global, told the BBC's Today programme that while the numbers indicated a ""very, very strong performance"" this might not last. ""It's a definite tailwind from the crackdown on password sharing, we saw that last quarter, it's continued into this quarter and will continue for another quarter or two but there's an expectation that will come to an end by this time next year."" The former Netflix man said the company wanted to ""people to move away from fixating on the subscriber numbers"". But the move to stop sharing subscriber numbers has ruffled feathers among analysts in the US. Jamie Lumley of research firm Third Bridge wrote that the decision raises ""questions about the growth prospects of Netflix's subscriber base"". Other technology giants such as Facebook parent Meta and social media platform X, formerly Twitter, also stopped reporting monthly active user numbers as growth slowed. Netflix shares have risen by more than 30% since the start of this year, close to their 2021 peak. However, they were almost 5% lower after the announcement. ""Streaming is a notoriously choppy market, and keeping hold of customer dollars is an uphill climb,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at share dealing platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""One area Netflix has an edge is its original content slate, which is known to be an excellent retention tool when compared to repurposed shows and films."" Netflix last raised the price of its popular ""standard"" plan in 2022. The move was followed by an unusual drop in subscribers that startled investors and intensified concerns that Netflix was losing dominance over the industry it had pioneered. Soon after, the company said it would reignite growth by cracking down on password sharing and launch a new plan that was less expensive but showed adverts. The firm is also pushing into areas such as sports and video games, while continuing to license material from rival media firms looking for ways to boost profits. Analysts said the company also benefited from its global footprint, which helped it maintain a relatively strong pipeline of new shows, despite strikes that rocked Hollywood last year.",2024-04-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68850766,business
131,US rate setter tells BBC 'no hurry' to cut interest rates,"A key member of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has told the BBC that inflation is only coming down ""very, very slowly"" and ""let's not be in a hurry"" on interest rate cuts. Raphael Bostic, the President of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, told BBC News that US interest rates will have to be kept at a ""restrictive level"" and might only ease ""at the end of 2024"". Expectations of a delay to US interest rate cuts has sent reverberations around the world economy in recent weeks, impacting government borrowing costs, including in the UK. At the beginning of the year, markets expected a series of rate cuts in the US and across Europe. The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told reporters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meeting that ""what happens in the US has a knock-on impact in the UK… inflation coming in slightly above expectations in the US has had some impact on market yields in the UK"". Those changes in the market for government debt can feed through to higher mortgage and business borrowing costs. The Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey was at pains to say in Washington that the pattern of UK inflation was different to what was occurring in the US. Mr Bostic, who casts one of the votes to decide US interest rates, said the American economy was creating lots of jobs and performing well: ""I've been saying for a long time that I expect the US economy to be strong, to continue to be strong, but not quite this strong, it is much stronger and more resilient than I have expected."" The strength in the US economy was keeping inflation higher than expected, he said: ""Let's be patient, let's not be in a hurry [on rate cuts], especially since there's so much good stuff that's happening on the employment side"". He also expressed some concern about US government debts, on course to hit a record, with little sign of either main Presidential election candidate addressing the issue: ""Maybe we should be having a conversation about, are we undermining the confidence in the full faith and credit of the US government, because we really can't afford to do that"". He also said that while the US dollar's role as the world's number one reserve currency was ""safe today"" he thought that ""everyone has to do things to make sure safety occurs.

132,Why a deluge of Chinese-made drugs is hard to curb,"When Sammy left her village in Sichuan province to attend university in northern China more than a decade ago, she was following a well-trodden rite of passage. The English language graduate was the first person in her family to go to university. She had a passion for foreign languages and dreamed of becoming a teacher. She had never heard of synthetic opioids before. After graduating, Sammy found work at a chemicals company in the Chinese city of Shijiazhuang, selling what she thought were chemicals to clients around the world. She would practice English every day speaking to her customers online, and earn a commission for each sale she made. Her dreams of becoming a teacher quickly faded. ""Maybe others are just like me… At the start we don't know what we are selling, but when we find out we have fallen in love with the work,"" she said. ""This work can make money,"" she adds. Sammy [not her real name] is an unlikely drug trafficker. She is one of what international law enforcement agencies estimate could be thousands of online sales representatives, working for illicit Chinese pharmaceutical and chemical companies producing and smuggling illegal laboratory made drugs. The US government has long accused China of flooding the country with deadly drugs like fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin, claims the Chinese government denies . The US says Chinese-made opioids are fuelling the worst drug crisis in the country's history. In 2022 more than 70,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses. According to a report published by the US select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government provides subsidies to companies openly trafficking illicit synthetic drugs. The report found tens of thousands of posts online advertising illegal drugs and pre-cursors. The study claims that ""wholly state owned"" companies are involved in the trafficking of drugs. The Chinese government has consistently denied knowledge of the illegal drug trade. Many like Sammy fall into the drug trade seemingly by accident, initially unaware of the products they are peddling online and their deadly consequences. But others are more aware of what they are selling. Each morning Sara [not her real name] posts photos and videos across her social media platforms advertising drugs; synthetic cannabinoids, precursors for MDMA, and nitazenes, a synthetic opioid considered up to 50 times more potent than even fentanyl. ""We have many customers in Britain and have cooperated with them many times,"" boasts Sara, an international trade graduate, now working for an online platform. When challenged, she is not drawn into a moral discussion about selling drugs. She claims she never asks customers how they use what she sells. The UK National Crime and Agency (NCA) believes drug dealers are mixing the synthetic opioid with street drugs such as heroin. According to the NCA , there have been more than 100 deaths linked to nitazenes over the past nine months, leading health professionals to warn the UK may be facing a drug-related crisis. The BBC has found hundreds of adverts for nitazenes online. Suppliers contacted claim to send shipments through courier services, mislabelling deliveries and hiding drugs in fake packaging. The BBC has also seen courier tracking numbers provided by online sales representative in China claiming to have made successful deliveries across the UK. Sara entered the business after university. She thought she was selling chemicals.  She has worked in the industry for two and a half years. ""I know most of the products,"" she says. ""My boss has been running this company for more than seven years, and he knows lots of customers and freight forwarders. If the product is detained, he will lose the most. So he will try his best to make the product reach you smoothly,"" she adds. In March, the UK government classified 15 synthetic opioids as Class A drugs. Under the Misuse of Drugs act anyone caught supplying or producing the drugs could face up to life in prison. Those caught in possession face seven years. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), China has between 40,000 and 100,000 pharmaceutical companies. ""China has long had one of the most significant pharmaceutical industries in Asia, as well as one of the largest chemical industries. And we've seen industry growth in other countries of the region,"" said Jeremy Douglas in late 2023, the then regional representative of the UNODC . ""While both industries are regulated, the challenge is significant given the sheer scale, and at the same time there are a number of ways to move products. Parcel post, air freight and shipping containers are all moving globally in high volumes,"" he said. Mr Douglas says that synthetic drugs are disrupting the traditional drug trade. Outside of China, synthetic drugs offer opportunities for both traditional crime organisations and upstarts able to buy directly from producers half a world away. ""Synthetics like fentanyl have several advantages over traditional drugs - compact, easily shippable, pre-existing demand, replaceable. They're attractive to traffickers."" That was confirmed in my conversations with sales people working for Chinese pharmaceutical firms. ""First of all, our packaging is completely secret, no one knows what it is until you open it, and second, we will change the name of the package and will not reveal any name about the product,"" says Sara. ""We will get the logistics order number when we send the package, we will track the situation of the package at any time, and any anomalies can be known and solved in time,"" she adds. According to Europol , the European police agency, China is the world's biggest manufacturer and distributor of synthetic, lab-made drugs. Some mimic the effects of traditional drugs like cannabis or cocaine. Chemists synthesise new drugs in order to stay one step ahead of the law. ""It is criminal entrepreneurship, but in a legitimate framework which is really unique,"" says Dr Louise Shelley the director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center (TraCCC) at George Mason University, and author of Dark Commerce. ""I have not seen such a professionalism and a corporate element in this anywhere else in the world. Criminal activity was a type of social mobility."" In 2020, researchers from TraCCC studied over 350 English language websites advertising the synthetic opioid fentanyl. ""From all the adverts that we found, nearly 40% of them were from corporate registries, and the largest hub of that was in Wuhan,"" says Dr Shelly. The sales people contacted by the BBC see the drug trade as simply another aspect of e-commerce. When challenged over selling drugs that damage lives, one described herself as a ""middleman."" ""Somebody needs it, somebody makes it, and I am just a middleman who lets customers know that I have it and what they do with it, I don't care,"" she says. ""Then I figured out I just need to make money. I don't know and don't care. Everyone has their own needs."" The woman boasts of clients from Canada to Croatia. She provided photos of recent drugs shipments complete with labels showing a UK address. ""I didn't know at first until I went online and translated the product into Chinese,"" she says via a message punctuated with a teary emoji. Another seller says: ""This industry is easy, and you can get higher wages, which attracts a large number of young people"". Natalie [not her real name], focuses on fentanyl. ""We buy from over 10 different labs and have a large selection. I have a professional shipping agent who packaged goods so has a very high delivery success rate to the UK."" Meanwhile, another supplier claimed to be able to smuggle drugs into the UK hidden in dog food packaging.  ""You don't need to worry about the packaging. We guarantee you safe delivery."" ""We ship in large quantities all over the world every day. Please trust our professional team. We guarantee 100% safe transportation."" In 2019, the Chinese government banned all forms of fentanyl and its analogues. In January 2024, China and the US launched a joint operation to curb the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. ""As long as market demand remains high in some parts of the world then that demand will be met in one way or another,"" said Mr Douglas from the UNODC.",2024-04-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68669244,business
133,Post Office victim calls for lawyer to be removed from Horizon redress scheme,"A Post Office scandal victim has called for a top lawyer to be removed from administering Horizon redress schemes. Former sub-postmaster Lee Castleton said Rodric Williams was ""conflicted"". Mr Williams was a litigation lawyer at the Post Office while it was prosecuting sub-postmasters. Separately, it emerged at an ongoing inquiry that Mr Williams had described a campaigner who tried to draw attention to faults in Horizon software in 2015 as a ""bluffer"". Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted of offences including theft and false accounting on the strength of faulty data from the Post Office's Horizon IT system. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Castleton said the process of getting compensation was ""still very adversarial because the people in the process of giving redress are people who have been involved in probably the last 10 or 15 years of... Post Office problems"". ""This gentleman here is still a lead lawyer. He needs removing. You cannot be conflicted more so than he is, in my belief. He's conflicted in many different ways, but he just needs removing from the process."" Mr Castleton added that the victims ""don't need to be traumatised any more and it needs to be done by an independent person"". Mr Williams rose through the ranks to become the Post Office's current head of legal for dispute resolution and brand. This unit handles appeals from sub-postmasters, compensation and redress. But according to his witness statement to the inquiry into the Post Office scandal, since April 2022 he has ""transferred my [redress] responsibilities to other lawyers within the unit's legal team"" so he can respond to requests for legal information. Mr Castleton did not call for Mr Williams to lose his job although he did say there should be ""hopefully some accountability at the end point"" of the inquiry. Mr Castleton, the former sub-postmaster of the Bridlington Post Office, tried to defend himself against accusations he had stolen money in the High Court and was bankrupted when he lost the case. His story was featured in ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Separately on Thursday, the inquiry heard how Mr Williams had referred to a former sub-postmaster and campaigner, Tim McCormack, as a ""bluffer"" in a 2015 email. Mr McCormack had written to the then Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells. In his email, which was revealed at an inquiry hearing, he offered to show ""clear and unquestionable evidence of an intermittent bug in Horizon"". Mr McCormack wrote in October 2015 that the bug ""can and does cause thousands of pounds in losses to sub-postmasters"". ""Tonight there is a branch in your network sitting on a loss of [five] figures. The money does not exist. It is the result of several one-sided transactions being entered erroneously by the system, not the operator."" Mr McCormack said it was ""a last chance"" for Ms Vennells to accept that ""what I have been telling you these last few years is true"". He offered to take her to the branch and to show her the evidence he had collected. Mr Williams replied on an email thread at the time that the Post Office should write to him ""in the same terms that we have every other person who has said they have evidence of flaws"". ""Generally, my view is that this guy is a bluffer, who keeps expecting us to march to his tune. ""I don't think we should do so, but instead respond with a straight bat."" When asked what he meant by the phrase, Mr Williams said that the Post Office should ""respond to his [Mr McCormack's] inbound enquiry seriously and appropriately"". He said he thought Mr McCormack was a bluffer because he was saying: ""You have options, or else"" which Mr Williams saw as ""a threat"". Nevertheless, Mr Williams said his recollection was that former Post Office executive Angela Van Den Bogerd met Mr McCormack ""to try and understand the issue in the branch"".",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68831011,business
134,Ex-Post Office chair defends himself against claims,"The Post Office's former chairman has defended himself after a report found he used derogatory language during a meeting about recruiting a board member. An investigation into Henry Staunton and the Post Office's current chief executive, Nick Read, detailed that the ex-chairman asked about a prospective candidate's race and where she came from. The report also examined a discussion about female recruits during the meeting with the Post Office's former human resources director, where Mr Staunton referred to women as ""girls"" and used the term ""pains in the arses"". In a statement, Mr Staunton said: ""I was, at the time, quoting a previous conversation that I had had when I was chair of another organisation in which, a woman in a senior management role had said to me that she did not like appointing 'girls' because they were, in her experience, 'pains in the arses'."" He added: ""The question I posed about the ethnicity of a candidate was seeking clarification in the context of our efforts to increase diversity."" Mr Staunton had asked if the candidate was ""coloured"". In his statement he said: ""I understand that the term I used has now fallen out of favour and is one I will not use again."" The investigation began after a whistleblower made a number of misconduct allegations against Mr Read - who has subsequently been cleared of wrongdoing. Mr Staunton said he had been told by the whistleblower themselves that he was not named in their so-called ""Speak Up"" complaint. Nevertheless, he was investigated along with Mr Read in a process led by a barrister at Devereux Chambers. The report was supposed to remain confidential. However, details emerged in the media on Wednesday. Mr Staunton was sacked by Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch in January after little more than a year in the role - leading to a tit-for-tat public row between the two. The Post Office is owned by the government and is the subject of a long-running inquiry into the Horizon scandal, where hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing from their accounts. After his exit, Mr Staunton claimed in an interview with the Sunday Times that he had been advised by a civil servant to stall compensation payments to allow the government to ""limp into the election"" without the impact of a large pay-out. The government strongly denied the allegation and Ms Badenoch claimed Mr Staunton was under a ""formal investigation"" for ""serious matters such as bullying"". Mr Staunton refuted this. He then disclosed in February that it was actually Mr Read who was under investigation after a Speak Up complaint was made against him. The Post Office confirmed at the time there were complaints against Mr Read and other staff. Commenting after details of the report emerged on Wednesday, Mr Staunton said: ""I understood from the statement made by the Business and Trade Department on the Post Office investigation that they wished to draw a line under the issue. I was fully intending to respect that and keep my own counsel. ""But from the fact that selected extracts of this supposedly confidential report have been leaked to the media suggests that they have no real intention of letting the matter rest and I therefore feel obliged to respond."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade, said: “As we said in our statement [on Wednesday], and Mr Staunton acknowledges, we feel this report has drawn a line under the issue and now regard the matter as closed, which allows us to turn our full attention to ensuring postmasters receive redress quickly and fairly.” A spokesperson for the Post Office said: ""In order to maintain the integrity of our Speak Up policy, and as a duty of care to all the individuals involved, it is absolutely appropriate that the report remains confidential. ""The fact that it was made public at all was a breach of that confidentiality."" The Post Office said that Mr Read had been ""exonerated of all the misconduct allegations and has the full and united backing of the board"".",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjk4nr63j04o,business
135,Biden calls for tripling tariffs on Chinese metals,"US President Joe Biden has called for a tripling of tariffs on some steel and aluminium from China. It is the latest protectionist policy to be embraced by Mr Biden as he campaigns for re-election against Donald Trump, who was known for his tough trade stance against China. The White House said the proposal was aimed at protecting US jobs against ""unfair"" competition. China has previously denied claims of dumping steel and aluminium overseas. Dumping is selling excess product in another country for a very cheap price and can often decimate the local industry's own market of that product. Speaking to members of the United Steelworkers union in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, the president said the Chinese prices were ""unfairly low"" due to the government subsidising companies ""who don't need to worry about making a profit"". ""They're cheating,"" Mr Biden said. ""And we've seen the damage here in America."" He said tens of thousands of steelworker jobs had been lost in the early 2000s because of Chinese imports. ""We're not going to let that happen again,"" he said. The Chinese embassy in the US said it ""firmly opposes"" the measures proposed by Mr Biden. ""Many trading partners of the United States, including China, are strongly dissatisfied with the United States' frequent use of national security, non-market behaviour, overcapacity and other reasons to impose restrictions and politicise trade issues,"" embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement to the BBC. Mr Pengyu added he hopes the US will work with China ""to stop actions that violate international economic and trade rules"" and cancel the tariffs. The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that this kind of geopolitical tension risked damaging global economic growth and pushing inflation in the wrong direction. The White House has denied that the tariffs - which would lift a key border tax rate from an average of 7.5% to 25% on a tiny fraction of imports - would raise prices in the US. Mr Biden discussed the proposal - and other pro-manufacturing efforts - at an election rally in Pittsburgh, a key base for the steel industry in the US. He and Mr Trump are competing for support from working class voters, who could be a deciding voting bloc in November's election. As well as the tariffs, the White House said it would launch an investigation into unfair trade practices in the Chinese shipbuilding and logistics sectors, acting on a request from the US Steelworkers union and others. The White House said it was also pushing for action against Chinese firms looking to avoid US border taxes by shipping through Mexico. Mr Biden has also spoken out against a proposed takeover of US Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, saying he believed the business should remain US-owned. The higher tariffs would affect metals imports being reviewed under a so-called 301 investigation, which focuses on policies affecting US commerce. Many steel and aluminium imports from China already face border taxes, including a 25% duty on certain steel products, which the US put in place under former president Donald Trump using national security justifications. Those were ruled to be in breach of global trade rules by the World Trade Organization and were later dialled back for many countries. Those tariffs marked a key turn in Washington's approach to trade, which had long been dominated by free-market, pro-trade consensus. Mr Trump, who called himself ""tariff man"", has pledged to be even more aggressive on trade should he be re-elected. He has proposed a 10% border tax on all imports, which would jump to more than 60% for products from China.",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68838063,business
136,'AI helps me to make wine for younger drinkers',"Kara Maraden is in charge of rather a lot of vineyards. The director of viticulture at large US wine firm Foley Family Farms, she is responsible for more than 5,200 acres (2,000 hectares) of vines, scattered across 1,000 miles of California and Oregon. She obviously cannot be everywhere at once, but thanks to AI technology, Ms Maraden can remotely check on the water requirements of individual vineyards from her laptop. ""I can go online and see what irrigations are needed down in Santa Barbara, 300 miles away,"" says Mr Maraden, who is based in Napa, north west of San Francisco. While judging the water requirements of the vines would previously have been done by human judgement and calculation, Foley now uses sensors made by Tule Technologies, a California-based irrigation company. The sensors, which look like mini weather stations, are placed across the vineyards. They measure moisture levels, temperatures, wind speeds, and other environmental variables. All this data is then fed into Tule's AI software system, which has been trained to calculate how much moisture will evaporate from both the soil and the vines under different weather conditions. The AI then determines how much irrigation the vines need and when, and informs the vineyard managers via an app notification. ""We're always boots on the ground,"" adds Ms Maraden. ""But the data helps us make informed decisions based on science, as opposed to just feelings. Feelings aren't bad, but we like to use data."" Foley Family Farms, together with its similarly named sister firm Foley Family Wines, produce US wines under 23 different brands. Ms Maraden says that the AI irrigation sensors ""have improved grape quality and consistency"". Tom Shapland, chief executive of Tule, says that another benefit of the sensors is that they can help overcome labour shortages. ""The AI provides a watchful eye in the vineyard 24/7."" Tule also makes an AI-powered app called Tule Vision, which can determine the thirstiness of vines after the human user records a few minutes' video of them. The AI was trained with hundreds of images of vines under varying water needs. Other providers of AI-powered vineyard monitoring equipment include US tech giant Cisco, and smaller firms Ceres Imaging and Bloomfield AI. Read more stories on artificial intelligence Once grapes for winemaking are harvested, they are taken into the winery for fermentation. Here too, AI is now getting involved. California-based tech firm Tastry makes an AI-powered app that helps winemakers make wine that a large number of consumers will like. The software does this by analysing a wine's chemical makeup, and quickly comparing it to a database of the taste preferences of 248 million US wine drinkers. Tastry tests for everything from a wine's sugar levels, to acidity and tannins. The latter are bitter and astringent compounds that come from grape skins, seeds and stems. The idea is that Tastry can help winemakers better blend final wines from numerous base wines, varying the percentage of each until a popular taste profile is achieved. Alexandre Remy, managing partner and winemaker at Atlas Wine Company, a California-based wine brand, describes Tastry as his ""GPS system"". ""If I want to create my red blend, I choose from 10 different vineyards,"" says Mr Remy. ""This is where AI really shines. It helps me determine my goal, whether I want to appeal to a younger crowd, or perhaps a crowd that prefers a competitor's wine. ""I can input my parameters into the system, and it will offer blend suggestions based on that."" Monika Christmann is a professor of enology - the science of winemaking - at Hochschule Geisenheim University in Germany. She says that wineries with big volumes, and which need consistency year after year, might find AI particularly useful. Yet she also cautions that the interaction between different wine components is difficult to predict, and not yet fully understood by AI. For wine traditionalists, the use of AI in winemaking, be it in the vineyard or the winery, is an anathema. They argue that it destroys the artisanry that can make wine so special. ""No algorithm can truly understand the complex interplay between climate, soil, and grape varieties that gives wine its subtlety and character,"" says Jonathan Kleeman, executive head sommelier at UK restaurant business Tom Sellers Story Group. ""Nor can it appreciate the aesthetics of balance, structure and aroma that distinguish an exceptional vintage. Wine speak of minerality, acidity or fruitiness is meaningless to a machine. True vintners trust their palate, not [computer] processors."" Tom Ashworth, chief executive of wine retailer Yapp Brothers, says that if he was making wine he wouldn't use AI. ""To what extent the winemaker allows AI to take over decision-making - replacing hundreds of years of experience - I guess depends on the risk-appetite of the domaine, and the accuracy of the AI itself. ""Currently, I wouldn't handover the decision making on key processes in vinification to AI, any more than I would let AI run customer services un-supervised."" Back in California, Ms Maraden counters that AI is about helping human winemakers, and not replacing them. ""We are boots on the ground, we ourselves are always in the vineyard,"" she says. ""What AI is really about [in wine] is making more informed decisions based on science.""",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68788080,business
137,United Airlines says Boeing blowout cost it $200m,"United Airlines has blamed Boeing for a $200m (£161m) hit to its earnings in the first three months of this year. The carrier was forced to ground its Boeing 737 MAX 9 fleet for three weeks after a mid-air cabin blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight in January. United said that pushed it to a pre-tax loss of $164m for the first quarter. The airline said it ""would have reported a quarterly profit"" otherwise. However, the loss was smaller than Wall Street expected and United's shares rose by more than 5% after the announcement. United has 79 Boeing 737 MAX 9s in its fleet, more than any of its rivals, and second only to Alaska Airlines. United and Alaska were forced to cancel thousands of flights as inspections were carried out in January before the US aviation regulator cleared the planes to resume flying. Safety regulators are now reviewing United's own operations, after other safety emergencies at the firm in recent weeks. United said that the ongoing review would delay the firm from putting new planes in to service until at least September. United told investors that its operations were also impacted by delays to deliveries of Boeing planes. ""We've adjusted our fleet plan to better reflect the reality of what the manufacturers are able to deliver,"" United's chief executive Scott Kirby said in a statement . Earlier this month, Boeing paid $160m to Alaska to make up for losses the airline had suffered. And speaking at a conference in March, the firm's chief financial officer Brian West said that its customers like United Airlines had been ""supportive of everything we're trying to do to enhance safety and quality for the industry"". Referring specifically to the pay out due to the events on 5 January, he added: ""We continue to stand behind our customers with that responsibility.” Boeing recently faced new pressure after a whistleblower reported safety concerns over the manufacturing of some of its planes to US regulators. Engineer Sam Salehpour accused Boeing of taking shortcuts in the construction of its 787 and 777 jets. He said he was ""threatened with termination"" after raising concerns with bosses. But Boeing said the allegations were ""inaccurate"" and added it was confident its planes were safe. Mr Salehpour is set to be the key witness at a US Senate hearing on 17 April. On 5 January, a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport. The latest incident raised fresh questions about the safety of Boeing's aircraft. The company faced intense scrutiny after two fatal crashes of 737 Max 8 passenger jets in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd189nmv2dro,business
138,Royal Bank of Scotland to close a fifth of branches,"Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) plans to close 18 of its 86 branches across Scotland, with the loss of 105 jobs. The closures will leave 69 branches in Scotland, in which it is pledging to invest more than £10m. RBS, now branded under the NatWest Group, says the further reduction in branch numbers is due to declining use by customers. It is promising there will be no further closures before 2026. Closures include three branches in Edinburgh, three in Glasgow, as well as Bathgate, East Kilbride, Largs, Aberdeen, New Deer and Helensburgh. However, RBS has plans to create a new flagship branch out of the two branches closing in Inverness. In a statement, RBS said customers were using digital banking ""more than ever before"" with over 80% of active current account holders using digital services. It said it was responding to an ""industry-wide shift"" to online services and investing in digital banking. An RBS spokesperson said: ""While we are increasingly engaging our customers digitally, our branch network remains important to us. ""We are also significantly investing in refreshing our network – we are investing £10.5m in our network across Scotland, from 2023-24, as well as continuing to invest in shared solutions like the Post Office and banking hubs. ""Our customers appreciate the speed and convenience of digital banking for everyday transactions, and often, when it comes to making bigger, more complex decisions they value speaking to our skilled and experienced colleagues."" The spokesperson added that more than 97% of its retail accounts are opened over the internet. RBS employs around 10,000 people in Scotland. As of December 2023, there were only 404 bank branches left in Scotland, with 636 banks and building societies closing since 2015 - more than 60% in just nine years. Esther O'Hara, Unite the union's industrial officer, called the move ""another massive blow to this loyal workforce and the communities the bank serve"". She said: ""Many of these banks are situated in rural and remote communities where RBS customers rely on this vital service. ""The proposed closures come off the back of RBS closures elsewhere in the UK and we fear this latest announcement is just another stage in the phasing out of banks from our nation's streets in the race to make all banking operations digital which is not suitable or accessible for many customers."" Ms O'Hara said Unite's priority was to ensure that there were no compulsory redundancies.

139,UK inflation falls as some food prices drop,"Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in two-and-a-half years, driven largely by slowing food price rises. Prices rose by 3.2% in the year to March, down from 3.4% the month before, according to official figures. The cost of some items including meat, crumpets, chocolate biscuits, furniture and household items fell. However, petrol and diesel prices rose. Lower inflation does not mean prices overall are coming down, they are just rising less quickly. While the overall rate of inflation has dropped, goods in the shops are still much more expensive than they were two years ago. Meat prices, driven by a drop in the cost of pork, fell by 0.5% between February and March, compared with a rise of 1.4% a year ago. It means the meat price rises slowed further to 3.1% in the year to March, the lowest rate since November 2021. Prices for furniture and household goods like cleaning products also fell by 0.9% in the year to March. Soaring food and energy bills have been the main causes behind the UK's high inflation in recent years. Inflation has been falling gradually since it peaked at 11.1% in late 2022, driven by the aftermath of Covid when demand for goods rose sharply after factories struggled to cope with the rise in demand. Oil and gas were also in greater demand after the pandemic, and prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine, cutting global supplies. The conflict also reduced the amount of grain for sale, pushing up food prices. It led to inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks hitting almost 20% last year - the highest level seen since the 1970s. Miles Johnson is a student in London, and has been shopping around more to make sure he is getting the best prices possible. ""I go to multiple places to get the best deal, sometimes I work from home not through choice - just because it's cheaper to eat at home and not pay for travel,"" he said. He said he is certainly feeling the strain of high prices and doesn't feel like things are getting any more manageable. The rate of inflation in March was slightly higher than economists expected, but experts said that was unlikely to change expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year, potentially as early as June. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said it expected inflation to return to its 2% target later this spring, ""which raises the prospect of interest rate cuts from June onwards"". Chancellor Jeremy Hunt described the latest official figures as ""welcome news"". He said that due to lower inflation and the government's recent cut in National Insurance for the employed and self-employed, which came into force on 6 April, ""people should start to feel the difference as well as see it in their pay cheques"". Speaking from the United States, where he is meeting key business leaders, Mr Hunt told the BBC: ""It is very tough and we have been through a very tough period."" But he argued the UK was emerging from a difficult time and that the ""fundamentals of the UK economy are actually very strong"". However, Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor said working people would still feel worse off. ""Prices are still high in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are going up and inflation is still higher than the Bank of England's target,"" she said. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said: ""Nobody will notice this in their pockets. By patting themselves on the back for this record, Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have proved just how out of touch they are."" The Bank makes its next interest rate decision on 9 May. The UK's central bank has been increasing interest rates in a bid to slow price rises and they are currently at their highest level for 16 years. The theory is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend, or may choose to save more as saving rates go up. This in turn reduces demand for goods and helps cool inflation. On Tuesday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the question was how much more evidence was necessary before starting to cut interest rates in the coming months. Consumer prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, with the UK inflation rate now sitting below that of the United States for the first time since early 2022. Some experts have said there is the prospect of the Bank of England starting to cut interest rates before their counterparts in the US as a result. Both central banks, as well as those in Europe, have increased rates across the last few years as inflation soared, but as various economies with strengths in different sectors see inflation fall at different rates, their paths on interest rates may diverge. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said that although inflation may be in ""retreat"" in the UK, ""the Bank of England cannot yet be sure that it is beaten"". With people's wage growth remaining above forecasts, ""and the economy reviving, the Bank will be in no hurry to cut interest rates"", he said. On Wednesday, separate ONS figures showed that private rents had increased by 9.2% in the 12 months to March, now averaging £1,285 in England. Next month's overall inflation figure looking back at April is expected to show a bigger drop as the lower energy price cap is taken into account, even as households' direct debits remain higher.

140,Post Office scandal unbelievable says ex-chairman,"Former Royal Mail chairman Allan Leighton has said the Horizon scandal is ""unbelievable"" and ""terrible"". Mr Leighton apologised for ""elements"" of the scandal that occurred during his time in the role. Earlier, a former Post Office investigator also apologised for not probing reported problems with the Horizon IT system, blaming cost. But ex sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who he investigated, said apologies ""don't make any difference"". Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted of offences including theft and false accounting on the strength of faulty Post Office Horizon data. At the time of Mr Leighton's employment there, between 2002 and 2009, the Post Office was a subsidiary of Royal Mail. He told an inquiry into that the scandal ""has been a terrible thing for everybody who has been involved in it, particularly the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses"". ""It's unbelievable that it's happened and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that elements of that occurred while at my tenure at the Royal Mail. ""I'm sorry for that happening."" Separately, former Post Office investigator Jon Longman said he should have tried harder to get data requested on behalf of Ms Misra, who was eight weeks pregnant when she was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Giving evidence to an inquiry into why so many sub-postmasters had been wrongfully accused, Mr Longman said ""cost should not have come into it"" in granting Ms Misra's repeated requests for data. The organisation had a policy of limiting data requests on the grounds of cost. Julian Blake, one of the lawyers acting for the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, asked why the requests had been rejected. An internal Post Office email from June 2009 argued the size of Ms Misra's request would have used up too much of its ""quota"", while another email argued that a lot of postmasters tend to ""plead guilty at the 11th hour"". ""With hindsight, I wish the data requested had been provided,"" Mr Longman told the inquiry, adding that he ""should have been a bit more forceful in getting disclosure to the defence"". Investigators were concerned there would be a ""world of trouble"" if the firm lost her test case. Speaking to the BBC at the Post Office inquiry Ms Misra said: ""The apologies don't make any difference. I don't know if I'll ever accept their apologies. I can't get the time back."" She said she wanted ""proper compensation for each and every victim and accountability"", adding that every person who was responsible for the scandal - either in the authorities, the Post Office, Royal Mail or Fujitsu - needed to be put behind bars.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68836956,business

The Post Office said Mr Read has ""the full and united backing of the board"" to continue in his role following the investigation by an external barrister. Mr Read also has the confidence of the government, a spokesperson said. The investigation into Mr Read's conduct had been revealed by former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton. Although the existence of allegations against Mr Read surfaced during a hearing looking at the Post Office Horizon scandal, the misconduct claims were separate from that. Mr Staunton told MPs who were looking into compensation payments for sub-postmasters over the scandal that Mr Read was at the centre of an investigation, consisting of allegations made by the Post Office's former HR boss. He claimed that Mr Read and the senior HR person ""fell out"" and that the allegations were about Mr Read's ""conduct and lack of his management of the many governance and compliance issues"". Mr Staunton also claimed Mr Read had tried to resign four times during his time as chair of the Post Office, between December 2022 and January 2024, and had been ""badgering over his salary"". The Post Office said Mr Staunton's claims contained ""inaccuracies and falsehoods"" and Mr Read told his staff last month that he ""absolutely refutes"" the claims made against him. On Wednesday, the organisation said a report written by barrister Marianne Tutin, of Devereux Chambers, had ""exonerated"" Mr Read of ""all misconduct allegations"". The Post Office has not released the document, and said it would be providing no further details about the allegations, which had been made as part of a whistleblowing process called ""Speak Up"". It said it was ""unacceptable that this specific process was referred to in the public domain"". However, it added: ""Post Office wants to make clear that Speak Up allegations will always be thoroughly and consistently investigated, whoever they are aimed at."" A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said Mr Read had ""the confidence of the government"". ""We feel this report has drawn a line under the issue and now regard the matter as closed, which allows us to turn our full attention to ensuring postmasters are compensated quickly and fairly,"" the spokesperson said. Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for theft and false accounting after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches. Legislation is going through parliament to quash the wrongful convictions of sub-postmasters, but campaigners have consistently criticised the amount of time it has taken for victims to receive full and final financial redress.

142,"During test-optional college admissions, exam-prep companies still thrived","Standardised tests such as the SAT and ACT have been optional at many US colleges since 2020. But many applicants still took them – and paid a premium for higher scores. For many students in the US, applying for university means sitting for a long, often gruelling standardised tests that could make or break acceptance to their dream school. These tests – commonly the SAT, ACT and Advanced Placement (AP) exams – have been around for decades. For most students, these exams require a lot of preparation, both to learn the format and the material. As such, many of the millions of American students who take them each year rely on test-prep companies, which help them crack the exam and boost their scores. This instruction comes at a premium. While some free and low-cost exam tutoring is available, many of the largest companies run group sessions that can cost between $600 and $1,500 (£480 and £1,205) or beyond, depending on duration – or on the extreme end, run into the five figures for private tutoring at the most elite levels . The test prep industry is expected to reach a value of nearly $50bn (£39.6bn) within the next few years. According to the College Board, which develops and administers standardised tests, 2.2 million American students in the class of 2019 took the SAT , an increase of 4% over the past year. It was the largest group ever. During the pandemic, however, amid mass cancellations at testing centres and disruptions in the college admissions process the exams became optional at many US institutions – in most cases, for the first time. Since 2020, they have largely remained voluntary. Since the policy change, the number of students who took the SAT dropped by thousands; for instance, in the class of 2022, only 1.7 million students took the exam. Yet test-optional admissions policies are on the way out. In April, leading US institutions Harvard University and Caltech announced they would once again require first-year applicants to submit scores from either the SAT, ACT, AP or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. This followed similar announcements from Yale University, Dartmouth College and Georgetown University earlier in the year. Other colleges are expected to follow suit. On its face, this is good news for the test-prep industry, which stands to benefit from customers keen to ace once-again compulsory exams. But experts in the industry say these companies' bottom lines held surprisingly steady during the four years of test-optional admissions. In fact, many of the test-prep industry's largest players emerged largely unscathed. That's because some students continued to take the exams and pay for the prep courses. Many were betting that even though test weren't required, reporting solid scores would put their applications at the top of the pile. And by and large, they were right. Despite optional testing policies throughout the past four years, many students continued to prepare for, and subsequently take, entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT. Where some students saw an opportunity to forgo submitting scores, many others ploughed ahead as if nothing had changed. This was particularly the case for those in higher income brackets. Data from the College Board shows that during 2022 , 46% of students who took the SAT came from either the highest (more than $110,244 [£88,678]) or second-highest ($83,766 to $110,244 [£67,379 to £137,054]) quintile in terms of median family income. During 2023 , these figures were nearly identical. Comparatively, only about 10% of SAT test-takers during those two years came from the lowest earning quintile ($53,263 [£42,838] or lower). ""Students coming from the highest income levels not only took the SAT more than any other group, but they scored the highest,"" says Sara Harberson , a former dean of admissions at Pennsylvania's Franklin & Marshall College, and a college admissions expert. Many students from these higher-income groups continued to use test prep services while the exam was optional in the same way they would have in the pre-pandemic landscape. ""It is clear that parents' income directly impacts a student's ability to take standardised tests and perform well on them,"" she says. ""Despite most colleges being test-optional these last few years, colleges have clearly valued students who report test scores – and high scores at that. The wealthier students were at a huge advantage as they were more likely to take standardised tests during the pandemic and perform better."" Business for most exam-prep companies – including both The Princeton Review and Kaplan, executives at each company told the BBC – hummed along as students continued to take high-priced classes, just as they would have pre-pandemic. Throughout the test-optional years, industry leaders say many students were advised by both experts and parents to act as if nothing had changed in order to stand out, especially if their kids were applying to highly selective colleges, which saw a spike in applicants during the period . ""I had to tell parents that they needed to invest in test prep,"" says Harberson. ""Scores matter in this landscape so much that if a family needs to choose how to spend money in regard to the college admissions process, I want families to invest in test prep."" ""Despite shifting college admission requirements, The Princeton Review never pivoted away from providing students with resources for the SAT and ACT,"" says Rob Franek , editor-in-chief at The Princeton Review, one of the largest test-prep companies in the US. ""Over the past four years, more than 13 million students took the SAT and or ACT… Test scores have continued to matter to colleges."" More like this: He says test scores also matter in determining tuition factors such as financial aid, scholarships and grants, so many students continued to take the exams when they were optional. In a survey released from The Princeton Review in February, 36% of respondents said financial aid was their main reason for taking the standardised exams . ""With 98% of our respondents reporting they will need financial aid to pay for college, we think this is a very significant reason students are taking the SAT and ACT."" Even as revenue has remained relatively steady throughout the past four years, the restoration of past exam policies should help drive more customers. ""As many of those schools have come back to making it a requirement, that has led to a surge again in that business,"" says Steven Marietti, the chief commercial officer for supplemental education at Kaplan, which has operated for 85 years. A revamped SAT for 2024 – now shorter and digital – offers even more potential revenue. While the exam will remain similar at its core, even minor changes have sent students scrambling to prepare. Harberson says the changes are a business boon: ""I guarantee the test-prep industry has gotten a big boost."" And as college admissions change with more applications than ever, exam scores may be more important than ever. ""Colleges are spending four or five minutes on an application,"" adds Harberson. With so little time to take everything into consideration, ""students better jump off the page"". -- For the best of BBC.com in your inbox every Friday, sign up to The Essential List newsletter for a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240416-test-optional-college-admissions-exam-prep-companies,business
143,What is the Bank of England and why does it change interest rates?,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the fifth time in March, keeping them at their highest level for 16 years. The pause follows a period of 14 successive increases, as the Bank tried to control inflation. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. It is independent of government but works closely with the Treasury. It describes its key job as ensuring the UK has secure banknotes, stable prices, a safe banking sector and a resilient financial system. The Bank has a target to keep inflation - the official measure of how quickly prices are rising - at 2%. The headline Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate - which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods - has fallen from a high of 11.1% in October 2022 to 3.2% in March 2024. But CPI remains above the Bank's target. The recent sharp increases in inflation were initially due to rising energy and food costs - largely caused by global events such as the war in Ukraine. But other factors - like wage increases in the UK - also helped keep prices high. The Bank's traditional response to rising inflation is to increase the UK's official interest rate. This affects the saving and mortgage rates which High Street banks and building societies charge individuals and businesses. From November 2021, the Bank increased interest rates on 14 successive occasions to 5.25%, the highest level since February 2008. The Bank has since held rates at that level five times, most recently in March 2024. Higher interest rates mean people have to pay more for their mortgages, for example, which means they have less money to spend on other things. Fewer people wanting to buy things should, in theory, mean that prices rise less quickly. It also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand. Alternatively, if the Bank cuts interest rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, and people have more money to spend on other things. This can encourage businesses and people to borrow and spend more, boosting the economy. The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he had seen ""strong evidence"" that the process to reduce inflation ""is working its way through"". But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that it would fall back to its 2% target and stay there . The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets eight times a year to set rates. Its nine members vote on whether to increase, reduce or hold interest rates. Minutes of the meeting at which the decision was taken are also published. The next rate announcement is on Thursday 9 May. Four times a year, the Bank also publishes a Monetary Policy Report, which sets out the economic analysis and inflation projections that the MPC uses to make its interest rate decisions. The next report will be published alongside the May decision. In April 2024, an independent review by Dr Ben Bernanke, former head of the US central bank, found that the Bank's economic forecasting system had ""serious deficiencies"" which need to be modernised. Governor Andrew Bailey said updating the Bank's systems was a ""high priority"". The Bank of England also buys and sells government bonds. Bonds are a bit like an IOU from the government, which uses them to raise money to help meet its spending commitments. In the period from the 2009 financial crisis until 2021, the Bank bought £875bn of government bonds. This was done through a process called quantitative easing. This was designed to reduce overall government borrowing costs, lower interest rates and stimulate spending in the economy. The bank also announced an emergency bond-buying programme to try to stabilise the economy, after the September 2022 mini-budget caused turmoil on financial markets. Once that intervention ended, the Bank said it would go ahead with a plan - first announced in August 2022 - to sell off some of the government bonds it holds. The Bank also: Andrew Bailey became governor in 2019, having already worked at the Bank of England for more than 30 years. He was the chief cashier from January 2004 until April 2011, which meant his signature appeared on billions of UK banknotes. As well as being responsible for overseeing the Bank, the governor also chairs three important committees that help it work towards its targets: the Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50837114,business
144,How do interest rates affect me?,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the fifth time in a row at its last meeting, but cuts are expected later in the year. Interest rates move up and down in order to control UK inflation, which has come down sharply in recent months, easing cost-of-living pressures. However, the UK economy has been stagnating amid increased borrowing costs and other pressures. Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The Bank of England's base rate, currently 5.25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This has a knock-on effect on what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest they pay on savings. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide what the base rate should be. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising across the economy as a whole . When inflation is going up, the Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less . The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. Mortgages Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey . When interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. About three-quarters of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. Their monthly payments aren't immediately affected when the Bank changes rates, but future deals are. Mortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. This means homebuyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a few years ago. About 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance. You can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator: Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders could decide to put their rates up, if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England, but if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. Individual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers. There are some good deals on the market, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest. The UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face ""robust action"" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers . The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years. However, the rate was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was running at 17% in November 1979 . There have been plenty of questions about why interest rates have not yet been cut, with the rate of inflation dropping sharply. Inflation was running at 3.2% in March . While that was down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, it is still above the Bank's 2% target. However, further falls are expected in the rate in the coming months. Governor Andrew Bailey has said that he had seen ""further encouraging signs"" that inflation was coming down. But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that it would fall back to its target and stay there. ""We're not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction,"" Mr Bailey added. The Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth - by keeping rates high. Interest rates have also been increasing across the world. However, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises. The UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57764601,business
145,UK inflation rate calculator: How much are prices rising for you?,"Every month there's a new figure for inflation - it estimates how much prices are rising across all the goods and services in the economy. In the 12 months to March 2024, the figure was 3.2% . That means things costing £1 in March 2023 cost just over £1.03 the same time the following year. Our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with the BBC, shows you what the inflation rate is for your household, and identifies the items in your household budget that have gone up the most in price over the past year. Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home, rather than the more widely-reported measure called CPI. In March 2024 this was 3.8%. If you can't see the calculator, click here.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62558817,business
146,Royal Bank of Scotland to close a fifth of branches,"Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) plans to close 18 of its 86 branches across Scotland, with the loss of 105 jobs. The closures will leave 69 branches in Scotland, in which it is pledging to invest more than £10m. RBS, now branded under the NatWest Group, says the further reduction in branch numbers is due to declining use by customers. It is promising there will be no further closures before 2026. Closures include three branches in Edinburgh, three in Glasgow, as well as Bathgate, East Kilbride, Largs, Aberdeen, New Deer and Helensburgh. However, RBS has plans to create a new flagship branch out of the two branches closing in Inverness. In a statement, RBS said customers were using digital banking ""more than ever before"" with over 80% of active current account holders using digital services. It said it was responding to an ""industry-wide shift"" to online services and investing in digital banking. An RBS spokesperson said: ""While we are increasingly engaging our customers digitally, our branch network remains important to us. ""We are also significantly investing in refreshing our network – we are investing £10.5m in our network across Scotland, from 2023-24, as well as continuing to invest in shared solutions like the Post Office and banking hubs. ""Our customers appreciate the speed and convenience of digital banking for everyday transactions, and often, when it comes to making bigger, more complex decisions they value speaking to our skilled and experienced colleagues."" The spokesperson added that more than 97% of its retail accounts are opened over the internet. RBS employs around 10,000 people in Scotland. As of December 2023, there were only 404 bank branches left in Scotland, with 636 banks and building societies closing since 2015 - more than 60% in just nine years. Esther O'Hara, Unite the union's industrial officer, called the move ""another massive blow to this loyal workforce and the communities the bank serve"". She said: ""Many of these banks are situated in rural and remote communities where RBS customers rely on this vital service. ""The proposed closures come off the back of RBS closures elsewhere in the UK and we fear this latest announcement is just another stage in the phasing out of banks from our nation's streets in the race to make all banking operations digital which is not suitable or accessible for many customers."" Ms O'Hara said Unite's priority was to ensure that there were no compulsory redundancies. The RBS branches earmarked for closure in September are: Aberdeen St Nicholas Bathgate Cumbernauld Tay Walk Dundee Kingsway Circus East Kilbride Edinburgh Bruntsfield Edinburgh Leith Edinburgh Nicolson Street Glasgow Cardonald Glasgow Charing Cross West Glasgow Rutherglen West Helensburgh Inverness Chief Office Inverness Eastgate Largs New Deer Newbridge Wishaw",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3gvmvn2yyo,business
147,UK inflation falls as some food prices drop,"Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in two-and-a-half years, driven largely by slowing food price rises. Prices rose by 3.2% in the year to March, down from 3.4% the month before, according to official figures. The cost of some items including meat, crumpets, chocolate biscuits, furniture and household items fell. However, petrol and diesel prices rose. Lower inflation does not mean prices overall are coming down, they are just rising less quickly. While the overall rate of inflation has dropped, goods in the shops are still much more expensive than they were two years ago. Meat prices, driven by a drop in the cost of pork, fell by 0.5% between February and March, compared with a rise of 1.4% a year ago. It means the meat price rises slowed further to 3.1% in the year to March, the lowest rate since November 2021. Prices for furniture and household goods like cleaning products also fell by 0.9% in the year to March. Soaring food and energy bills have been the main causes behind the UK's high inflation in recent years. Inflation has been falling gradually since it peaked at 11.1% in late 2022, driven by the aftermath of Covid when demand for goods rose sharply after factories struggled to cope with the rise in demand. Oil and gas were also in greater demand after the pandemic, and prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine, cutting global supplies. The conflict also reduced the amount of grain for sale, pushing up food prices. It led to inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks hitting almost 20% last year - the highest level seen since the 1970s. Miles Johnson is a student in London, and has been shopping around more to make sure he is getting the best prices possible. ""I go to multiple places to get the best deal, sometimes I work from home not through choice - just because it's cheaper to eat at home and not pay for travel,"" he said. He said he is certainly feeling the strain of high prices and doesn't feel like things are getting any more manageable. The rate of inflation in March was slightly higher than economists expected, but experts said that was unlikely to change expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this year, potentially as early as June. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said it expected inflation to return to its 2% target later this spring, ""which raises the prospect of interest rate cuts from June onwards"". Chancellor Jeremy Hunt described the latest official figures as ""welcome news"". He said that due to lower inflation and the government's recent cut in National Insurance for the employed and self-employed, which came into force on 6 April, ""people should start to feel the difference as well as see it in their pay cheques"". Speaking from the United States, where he is meeting key business leaders, Mr Hunt told the BBC: ""It is very tough and we have been through a very tough period."" But he argued the UK was emerging from a difficult time and that the ""fundamentals of the UK economy are actually very strong"". However, Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor said working people would still feel worse off. ""Prices are still high in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are going up and inflation is still higher than the Bank of England's target,"" she said. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said: ""Nobody will notice this in their pockets. By patting themselves on the back for this record, Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have proved just how out of touch they are."" The Bank makes its next interest rate decision on 9 May. The UK's central bank has been increasing interest rates in a bid to slow price rises and they are currently at their highest level for 16 years. The theory is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend, or may choose to save more as saving rates go up. This in turn reduces demand for goods and helps cool inflation. On Tuesday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the question was how much more evidence was necessary before starting to cut interest rates in the coming months. Consumer prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, with the UK inflation rate now sitting below that of the United States for the first time since early 2022. Some experts have said there is the prospect of the Bank of England starting to cut interest rates before their counterparts in the US as a result. Both central banks, as well as those in Europe, have increased rates across the last few years as inflation soared, but as various economies with strengths in different sectors see inflation fall at different rates, their paths on interest rates may diverge. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said that although inflation may be in ""retreat"" in the UK, ""the Bank of England cannot yet be sure that it is beaten"". With people's wage growth remaining above forecasts, ""and the economy reviving, the Bank will be in no hurry to cut interest rates"", he said. On Wednesday, separate ONS figures showed that private rents had increased by 9.2% in the 12 months to March, now averaging £1,285 in England. Next month's overall inflation figure looking back at April is expected to show a bigger drop as the lower energy price cap is taken into account, even as households' direct debits remain higher.

148,Post Office scandal unbelievable says ex-chairman,"Former Royal Mail chairman Allan Leighton has said the Horizon scandal is ""unbelievable"" and ""terrible"". Mr Leighton apologised for ""elements"" of the scandal that occurred during his time in the role. Earlier, a former Post Office investigator also apologised for not probing reported problems with the Horizon IT system, blaming cost. But ex sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who he investigated, said apologies ""don't make any difference"". Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted of offences including theft and false accounting on the strength of faulty Post Office Horizon data. At the time of Mr Leighton's employment there, between 2002 and 2009, the Post Office was a subsidiary of Royal Mail. He told an inquiry into that the scandal ""has been a terrible thing for everybody who has been involved in it, particularly the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses"". ""It's unbelievable that it's happened and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that elements of that occurred while at my tenure at the Royal Mail. ""I'm sorry for that happening."" Separately, former Post Office investigator Jon Longman said he should have tried harder to get data requested on behalf of Ms Misra, who was eight weeks pregnant when she was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Giving evidence to an inquiry into why so many sub-postmasters had been wrongfully accused, Mr Longman said ""cost should not have come into it"" in granting Ms Misra's repeated requests for data. The organisation had a policy of limiting data requests on the grounds of cost. Julian Blake, one of the lawyers acting for the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, asked why the requests had been rejected. An internal Post Office email from June 2009 argued the size of Ms Misra's request would have used up too much of its ""quota"", while another email argued that a lot of postmasters tend to ""plead guilty at the 11th hour"". ""With hindsight, I wish the data requested had been provided,"" Mr Longman told the inquiry, adding that he ""should have been a bit more forceful in getting disclosure to the defence"". Investigators were concerned there would be a ""world of trouble"" if the firm lost her test case. Speaking to the BBC at the Post Office inquiry Ms Misra said: ""The apologies don't make any difference. I don't know if I'll ever accept their apologies. I can't get the time back."" She said she wanted ""proper compensation for each and every victim and accountability"", adding that every person who was responsible for the scandal - either in the authorities, the Post Office, Royal Mail or Fujitsu - needed to be put behind bars.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68836956,business
149,Post Office boss Nick Read cleared of misconduct claims,"The boss of the Post Office Nick Read has been cleared of misconduct allegations after an investigation on behalf of the organisation. The Post Office said Mr Read has ""the full and united backing of the board"" to continue in his role following the investigation by an external barrister. Mr Read also has the confidence of the government, a spokesperson said. The investigation into Mr Read's conduct had been revealed by former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton. Although the existence of allegations against Mr Read surfaced during a hearing looking at the Post Office Horizon scandal, the misconduct claims were separate from that. Mr Staunton told MPs who were looking into compensation payments for sub-postmasters over the scandal that Mr Read was at the centre of an investigation, consisting of allegations made by the Post Office's former HR boss. He claimed that Mr Read and the senior HR person ""fell out"" and that the allegations were about Mr Read's ""conduct and lack of his management of the many governance and compliance issues"". Mr Staunton also claimed Mr Read had tried to resign four times during his time as chair of the Post Office, between December 2022 and January 2024, and had been ""badgering over his salary"". The Post Office said Mr Staunton's claims contained ""inaccuracies and falsehoods"" and Mr Read told his staff last month that he ""absolutely refutes"" the claims made against him. On Wednesday, the organisation said a report written by barrister Marianne Tutin, of Devereux Chambers, had ""exonerated"" Mr Read of ""all misconduct allegations"". The Post Office has not released the document, and said it would be providing no further details about the allegations, which had been made as part of a whistleblowing process called ""Speak Up"". It said it was ""unacceptable that this specific process was referred to in the public domain"". However, it added: ""Post Office wants to make clear that Speak Up allegations will always be thoroughly and consistently investigated, whoever they are aimed at."" A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said Mr Read had ""the confidence of the government"". ""We feel this report has drawn a line under the issue and now regard the matter as closed, which allows us to turn our full attention to ensuring postmasters are compensated quickly and fairly,"" the spokesperson said. Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for theft and false accounting after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches. Legislation is going through parliament to quash the wrongful convictions of sub-postmasters, but campaigners have consistently criticised the amount of time it has taken for victims to receive full and final financial redress. As of 31 March, 37 people had received full and final compensation for overturned convictions.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68835798,business
150,"During test-optional college admissions, exam-prep companies still thrived","Standardised tests such as the SAT and ACT have been optional at many US colleges since 2020. But many applicants still took them – and paid a premium for higher scores. For many students in the US, applying for university means sitting for a long, often gruelling standardised tests that could make or break acceptance to their dream school. These tests – commonly the SAT, ACT and Advanced Placement (AP) exams – have been around for decades. For most students, these exams require a lot of preparation, both to learn the format and the material. As such, many of the millions of American students who take them each year rely on test-prep companies, which help them crack the exam and boost their scores. This instruction comes at a premium. While some free and low-cost exam tutoring is available, many of the largest companies run group sessions that can cost between $600 and $1,500 (£480 and £1,205) or beyond, depending on duration – or on the extreme end, run into the five figures for private tutoring at the most elite levels . The test prep industry is expected to reach a value of nearly $50bn (£39.6bn) within the next few years. According to the College Board, which develops and administers standardised tests, 2.2 million American students in the class of 2019 took the SAT , an increase of 4% over the past year. It was the largest group ever. During the pandemic, however, amid mass cancellations at testing centres and disruptions in the college admissions process the exams became optional at many US institutions – in most cases, for the first time. Since 2020, they have largely remained voluntary. Since the policy change, the number of students who took the SAT dropped by thousands; for instance, in the class of 2022, only 1.7 million students took the exam. Yet test-optional admissions policies are on the way out. In April, leading US institutions Harvard University and Caltech announced they would once again require first-year applicants to submit scores from either the SAT, ACT, AP or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. This followed similar announcements from Yale University, Dartmouth College and Georgetown University earlier in the year. Other colleges are expected to follow suit. On its face, this is good news for the test-prep industry, which stands to benefit from customers keen to ace once-again compulsory exams. But experts in the industry say these companies' bottom lines held surprisingly steady during the four years of test-optional admissions. In fact, many of the test-prep industry's largest players emerged largely unscathed. That's because some students continued to take the exams and pay for the prep courses. Many were betting that even though test weren't required, reporting solid scores would put their applications at the top of the pile. And by and large, they were right. Despite optional testing policies throughout the past four years, many students continued to prepare for, and subsequently take, entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT. Where some students saw an opportunity to forgo submitting scores, many others ploughed ahead as if nothing had changed. This was particularly the case for those in higher income brackets. Data from the College Board shows that during 2022 , 46% of students who took the SAT came from either the highest (more than $110,244 [£88,678]) or second-highest ($83,766 to $110,244 [£67,379 to £137,054]) quintile in terms of median family income. During 2023 , these figures were nearly identical. Comparatively, only about 10% of SAT test-takers during those two years came from the lowest earning quintile ($53,263 [£42,838] or lower). ""Students coming from the highest income levels not only took the SAT more than any other group, but they scored the highest,"" says Sara Harberson , a former dean of admissions at Pennsylvania's Franklin & Marshall College, and a college admissions expert. Many students from these higher-income groups continued to use test prep services while the exam was optional in the same way they would have in the pre-pandemic landscape. ""It is clear that parents' income directly impacts a student's ability to take standardised tests and perform well on them,"" she says. ""Despite most colleges being test-optional these last few years, colleges have clearly valued students who report test scores – and high scores at that. The wealthier students were at a huge advantage as they were more likely to take standardised tests during the pandemic and perform better."" Business for most exam-prep companies – including both The Princeton Review and Kaplan, executives at each company told the BBC – hummed along as students continued to take high-priced classes, just as they would have pre-pandemic. Throughout the test-optional years, industry leaders say many students were advised by both experts and parents to act as if nothing had changed in order to stand out, especially if their kids were applying to highly selective colleges, which saw a spike in applicants during the period . ""I had to tell parents that they needed to invest in test prep,"" says Harberson. ""Scores matter in this landscape so much that if a family needs to choose how to spend money in regard to the college admissions process, I want families to invest in test prep."" ""Despite shifting college admission requirements, The Princeton Review never pivoted away from providing students with resources for the SAT and ACT,"" says Rob Franek , editor-in-chief at The Princeton Review, one of the largest test-prep companies in the US. ""Over the past four years, more than 13 million students took the SAT and or ACT… Test scores have continued to matter to colleges."" More like this: He says test scores also matter in determining tuition factors such as financial aid, scholarships and grants, so many students continued to take the exams when they were optional. In a survey released from The Princeton Review in February, 36% of respondents said financial aid was their main reason for taking the standardised exams . ""With 98% of our respondents reporting they will need financial aid to pay for college, we think this is a very significant reason students are taking the SAT and ACT."" Even as revenue has remained relatively steady throughout the past four years, the restoration of past exam policies should help drive more customers. ""As many of those schools have come back to making it a requirement, that has led to a surge again in that business,"" says Steven Marietti, the chief commercial officer for supplemental education at Kaplan, which has operated for 85 years. A revamped SAT for 2024 – now shorter and digital – offers even more potential revenue. While the exam will remain similar at its core, even minor changes have sent students scrambling to prepare.

151,What is the Bank of England and why does it change interest rates?,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the fifth time in March, keeping them at their highest level for 16 years. The pause follows a period of 14 successive increases, as the Bank tried to control inflation. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. It is independent of government but works closely with the Treasury. It describes its key job as ensuring the UK has secure banknotes, stable prices, a safe banking sector and a resilient financial system. The Bank has a target to keep inflation - the official measure of how quickly prices are rising - at 2%. The headline Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate - which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods - has fallen from a high of 11.1% in October 2022 to 3.2% in March 2024. But CPI remains above the Bank's target. The recent sharp increases in inflation were initially due to rising energy and food costs - largely caused by global events such as the war in Ukraine. But other factors - like wage increases in the UK - also helped keep prices high. The Bank's traditional response to rising inflation is to increase the UK's official interest rate. This affects the saving and mortgage rates which High Street banks and building societies charge individuals and businesses. From November 2021, the Bank increased interest rates on 14 successive occasions to 5.25%, the highest level since February 2008. The Bank has since held rates at that level five times, most recently in March 2024. Higher interest rates mean people have to pay more for their mortgages, for example, which means they have less money to spend on other things. Fewer people wanting to buy things should, in theory, mean that prices rise less quickly. It also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand. Alternatively, if the Bank cuts interest rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, and people have more money to spend on other things. This can encourage businesses and people to borrow and spend more, boosting the economy. The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he had seen ""strong evidence"" that the process to reduce inflation ""is working its way through"". But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that it would fall back to its 2% target and stay there . The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets eight times a year to set rates. Its nine members vote on whether to increase, reduce or hold interest rates. Minutes of the meeting at which the decision was taken are also published. The next rate announcement is on Thursday 9 May. Four times a year, the Bank also publishes a Monetary Policy Report, which sets out the economic analysis and inflation projections that the MPC uses to make its interest rate decisions. The next report will be published alongside the May decision. In April 2024, an independent review by Dr Ben Bernanke, former head of the US central bank, found that the Bank's economic forecasting system had ""serious deficiencies"" which need to be modernised. Governor Andrew Bailey said updating the Bank's systems was a ""high priority"". The Bank of England also buys and sells government bonds. Bonds are a bit like an IOU from the government, which uses them to raise money to help meet its spending commitments. In the period from the 2009 financial crisis until 2021, the Bank bought £875bn of government bonds. This was done through a process called quantitative easing. This was designed to reduce overall government borrowing costs, lower interest rates and stimulate spending in the economy. The bank also announced an emergency bond-buying programme to try to stabilise the economy, after the September 2022 mini-budget caused turmoil on financial markets. Once that intervention ended, the Bank said it would go ahead with a plan - first announced in August 2022 - to sell off some of the government bonds it holds. The Bank also: Andrew Bailey became governor in 2019, having already worked at the Bank of England for more than 30 years. He was the chief cashier from January 2004 until April 2011, which meant his signature appeared on billions of UK banknotes. As well as being responsible for overseeing the Bank, the governor also chairs three important committees that help it work towards its targets: the Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50837114,business
152,How do interest rates affect me?,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the fifth time in a row at its last meeting, but cuts are expected later in the year. Interest rates move up and down in order to control UK inflation, which has come down sharply in recent months, easing cost-of-living pressures. However, the UK economy has been stagnating amid increased borrowing costs and other pressures. Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The Bank of England's base rate, currently 5.25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This has a knock-on effect on what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest they pay on savings. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide what the base rate should be. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising across the economy as a whole . When inflation is going up, the Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less . The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. Mortgages Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey . When interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. About three-quarters of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. Their monthly payments aren't immediately affected when the Bank changes rates, but future deals are. Mortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. This means homebuyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a few years ago. About 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance. You can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator: Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders could decide to put their rates up, if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England, but if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. Individual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers. There are some good deals on the market, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest. The UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face ""robust action"" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers . The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years. However, the rate was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was running at 17% in November 1979 . There have been plenty of questions about why interest rates have not yet been cut, with the rate of inflation dropping sharply. Inflation was running at 3.2% in March . While that was down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, it is still above the Bank's 2% target. However, further falls are expected in the rate in the coming months. Governor Andrew Bailey has said that he had seen ""further encouraging signs"" that inflation was coming down. But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that it would fall back to its target and stay there. ""We're not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction,"" Mr Bailey added. The Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth - by keeping rates high. Interest rates have also been increasing across the world. However, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises. The UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57764601,business
153,UK inflation rate calculator: How much are prices rising for you?,"Every month there's a new figure for inflation - it estimates how much prices are rising across all the goods and services in the economy. In the 12 months to March 2024, the figure was 3.2% . That means things costing £1 in March 2023 cost just over £1.03 the same time the following year. Our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in collaboration with the BBC, shows you what the inflation rate is for your household, and identifies the items in your household budget that have gone up the most in price over the past year. Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home, rather than the more widely-reported measure called CPI. In March 2024 this was 3.8%. If you can't see the calculator, click here.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62558817,business
154,Bernard Hill: Titanic and Lord of the Rings actor dies,"Actor Bernard Hill, best known for roles in Titanic and Lord of the Rings, has died aged 79. He played Captain Edward Smith in the 1997 Oscar-winning film and King Théoden in the Lord of the Rings. His breakout role was in 1982 BBC TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff, where he portrayed Yosser Hughes, a character who struggled - and often failed - to cope with unemployment in Liverpool. He died early on Sunday morning, his agent Lou Coulson confirmed. With him at the time were his fiancee Alison and his son Gabriel. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, the actors who played the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, paid tribute to their co-star at Comic Con in Liverpool. Astin began by saying: ""We love him. He was intrepid, he was funny, he was gruff, he was irascible, he was beautiful."" Boyd recounted watching the trilogy with Monaghan, saying: ""I don't think anyone spoke Tolkien's words as great as Bernard did. He would break my heart. He will be solely missed."" Alan Bleasdale, who wrote Boys from the Blackstuff, said Hill's death was a ""great loss and also a great surprise"". ""It was an astonishing, mesmeric performance - Bernard gave everything to that and you can see it in all the scenes. He became Yosser Hughes."" He added: ""I was desperate to work with him. Everything he did - his whole procedure for working, the manner in which he worked and his performance was everything that you could ever wish for. ""You always felt that Bernard would live forever. He had a great strength, physically and of personality."" Hill, who was from Manchester and lived in Suffolk, was due to return to TV screens in series two of The Responder, a BBC drama starring Martin Freeman, which begins airing on Sunday. Lindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, paid tribute to him, saying: ""Bernard Hill blazed a trail across the screen, and his long-lasting career filled with iconic and remarkable roles is a testament to his incredible talent."" ""From Boys from the Blackstuff, to Wolf Hall, The Responder, and many more, we feel truly honoured to have worked with Bernard at the BBC. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this sad time."" In Boys from the Blackstuff, Hill drew praise for his gritty portrayal of Yosser Hughes, an intense character who pleaded ""Gizza [give us a] job"" as he sought work. That show won a Bafta for best drama series in 1983, and in 2000 it was ranked seventh on a British Film Institute list of the best TV shows ever made. Another of Hill's memorable BBC TV performances came in the 2015 drama series Wolf Hall, adapted from Hilary Mantel's book about the court of Henry VIII. Hill portrayed the Duke of Norfolk - an uncle of Anne Boleyn and an enemy of Cardinal Wolsey. In Peter Jackson's epic trilogy The Lord of the Rings, Hill joined the cast for the second film, 2002's The Two Towers, and returned to the franchise for 2003's The Return Of The King, which picked up 11 Oscars. Other roles in Hill's decades-long career included the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius, an appearance in 1982's Gandhi, Shirley Valentine in 1989, The Scorpion King in 2002 and 2008 Tom Cruise film Valkyrie. He was meant to be at Comic Con Liverpool on Saturday, but had to cancel at the last minute, the convention said in a post on X. As news of his death broke, the organisers said on the platform they were ""heartbroken"" at Hill's death, and wished his family a ""lot of strength"". Scottish musician Barbara Dickson also paid tribute on X , saying he had been a ""really marvellous actor"". She added: ""It was a privilege to have crossed paths with him. RIP Benny x.""",2024-05-06,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68962192,entertainment
155,A J-pop band's favourite live music experiences in Tokyo,"YOASOBI breaks musical barriers both in their native Japan and overseas. Here's how they enjoy Tokyo's hottest live music, from buskers in Shibuya to concerts at Nippon Budokan. Vibrant subcultures and the second largest music market in the world make Tokyo a bucket list-worthy ""music destination""; delighting locals and visitors alike with its sheer diversity. We spoke with chart-topping J-pop sensation YOASOBI, aka Vocaloid music producer Ayase and singer Ikura , to get a feel for the city’s musical landscape. ""Given that Tokyo is the capital and the biggest city in Japan, a lot of the creative talent and artists gather [here] to explore cutting-edge sounds and music,"" says Ayase, whose wildly popular collaborations with Ikura were originally based on short stories from Monogatary.com ; Sony Music Entertainment Japan 's social network for creative artists. ""A lot of the trends and sounds are set in Tokyo; that’s why the music scene is so high level."" Long before YOASOBI became internationally famous, Tokyo eclectic musical culture and venues allowed them to perfect their unique, literary-inspired sound. ""In Japan and Tokyo, there's a lot of individuality, so whether you go to the clubs or live houses or maybe [to] a specific venue to see an artist you like, there's not just one space where all that culture is packed into,"" says Ayase. Discovering Tokyo is an endless journey of exploration, with something to offer to every music enthusiast, from nostalgia-fueled city pop to experimental sounds. Here are Ayase and Ikura's favourite ways to experience Tokyo's contemporary music scene. Frenetically dynamic, Shibuya has become one of Tokyo's most popular destinations. Spanning 15 sq km and brimming with venues that cater to different music crowds, the district attracts everyone from curious passersby enjoying street performances to connoisseurs exploring the live music scene. Shibuya is the epicentre of trends and a mandatory stop for visitors, says Ayase. He recommends first-time travellers and those who want to discover Tokyo’s music offerings start off by exploring the district on foot. ""Shibuya is where you can experience the hottest trends in terms of music,"" he says. ""It centres around the younger generation so they drive a lot of the culture, whether it’s fashion, the clubbing scene or music. The town is very lively so [...] you’re going to hear music almost 24/7… You can walk in the city and see these huge LED billboards where a lot of artists are promoting their latest work and teasing their music videos."" Ikura encourages visitors to pay attention to buskers in the area. ""At the corner of the Shibuya Scramble Crossing , in front of Tsutaya , you can find street musicians playing,"" she says. A landmark of Shibuya's world-famous intersection, the Tsutaya book store is located right in front of the Shibuya JR [train] Station and is, as Ikura explains, ""just two steps away from the Hachiko [dog] statue"". Address: 2 Dogenzaka, Shibuya-ku, 150-0043 Tokyo Instagram: @city_shibuya_official Perhaps no other place on the planet flaunts the diversity of Tokyo’s live music landscape quite so well as ""live houses"" – venues of varied sizes and aesthetics that host gigs every night. And there’s no shortage of options; all acts and musical genres, from jazz to heavy metal, find a place in the eclectic Tokyo scene. A superb example is Shibuya Gee ge , an unassuming and intimate venue with a motley selection of show listings. The live house, which is slated to celebrate its 14th anniversary in September 2024, is equipped with a grand piano and a high-quality audio system often commended by local artists. Before rising to global stardom, Ikura occassionally performed here and still recommends it without a second thought. ""You can find good singer-songwriters playing at this venue,"" she says. Website: http://www.gee-ge.net/ Address: 3−10 4 階 , Udagawacho, Shibuya City, 150-0042 Tokyo Phone: +81 3-6416-3468 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/gee_ge.official/ The next stop on YOASOBI's list is the Nippon Budokan . Originally conceived as a martial arts hall for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics , Budokan is an octagonal arena-style venue steeped in music history. ""We have a lot of sentiment and memories there because it's a very famous venue where the top artists from Japan perform,"" says Ikura. The storied venue has witnessed legendary moments of music history over the years. In 1966, the arena welcomed The Beatles for a five-date concert, establishing a rock 'n roll tradition perpetuated by groups such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Cheap Trick . Budokan's reputation as one of Japan's most iconic concert halls grew exponentially over the years as stars sold out concerts and recorded critically acclaimed live albums . Nowadays, the venue remains a coveted and prestigious location for international and local acts. ""Performing there is usually the dream of upcoming artists and it was our dream as well,"" Ikura says. ""YOASOBI became really active in the middle of the Covid-19 [pandemic] so we couldn’t do a lot of performances in front of an audience. In December 2021, we got to perform in the Budokan for the first time with a live audience and it was such a memorable experience for us to be performing in the same venue where [emblematic] artists have performed."" Website: https://www.nipponbudokan.or.jp/english Address: 2-3 Kitanomarukōen, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 102-8321 Phone: +81 3-3216-5100  With scenic paths and attractions such as a zoo and the Ghibli Museum, Inokashira Park is a favorite busking spot for artists. Located in Western Tokyo, about 20km from Shibuya, this enchanting spot is Ikura’s recommendation for outdoor music performances. ""When I was still a student, I used to hang out a lot in the area of Kichijoji. I spent a better part of my teen years there, more specifically, in a park called Inokashira Park,"" she says. ""I used to perform on the street back when I was really young. That experience of performing in front of the public put me on the path of [becoming] an artist and my music-writing and music-making career originated there. Kichijoji and that park are very intimate place for me in terms of my musical history."" Inokashira Park, however, is not only relevant to Ikura’s personal story; the park has served as the filming location of music-centered movies such as Parks , starring Mei Nagano , and hosts outdoor concerts and music festivals every year. Address: 1-18-31, Gotenyama, Musashino-shi, Tokyo  Recognised as the home of counterculture movements in Tokyo, the Koenji neighbourhood reflects Tokyo’s edgy and unconventional spirit, and is littered with vintage shops, music bars and live houses. In fact, Koenji is known as the birthplace of the punk movement in Japan. ""There’s a lot of culture there between actors, actresses, bands, artists, creatives and even comedians,"" says Ayase of the creative hub, just two metro stops from Shibuya. The artistic offerings in Koenji are varied, ranging from vintage record stores to indie rock and punk basement bars. However, Ayase, who has long been part of the neighbourhood’s artistic community, recommends walking around the Koenji Station for the most authentic experience. ""There are a lot of musicians playing their songs in this station area,"" he says. ""I used to be in a [rock] band and we moved to Tokyo with the dream to perform and make it big one day. The first place I arrived in Tokyo was Koenji. It was a very fun experience for me, looking back. I think [about] it as a big milestone for my musical career."" Address: 4 Chome-48-2 Koenjiminami, Suginami City, Tokyo 166-0003 You can't talk about Tokyo’s contemporary music scene without mentioning its nightlife and gig culture. ""I think there’s a very strong club culture in Shibuya so whether [you’re looking for] a hip hop-type of vibe or an EDM type of vibe, you can find a lot of those clubs in this area in Shibuya called Dogenzaka ,"" says Ayase. With a slew of entertainment spaces dedicated to different genres, Dogenzaka Street is a go-to for whoever wants to lose themselves to the beat. Options are endless and cater to different tastes, but Ayase mentions a specific Shibuya institution that has been open since 1996, pioneering the ""all music-genres"" scene and accommodating different music acts from DJs to rappers. "" Club Asia , specifically is a good example,"" he says. ""But there’s also a lot of live houses that you can attend close to the Shibuya Station. There’s definitely a lot of options.""

156,Madonna's free Brazil concert at Rio's Copacabana beach attracts more than 1.6 million fans,"Madonna put on a free concert in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night with throngs of fans flocking to see the pop idol on Brazil's famous Copacabana beach. ""Rio, here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,"" she declared, as the performance got under way. The show was the final stop on the 65-year-old's Celebration Tour, celebrating her 40 years in music. More than 1.6 million fans were estimated to have attended the show. ""Are you ready?"" Madonna posted on her Instagram account seven hours before the show. Crowds of fans were seen dancing along to Madonna's songs played from speakers on the stage, hours before the American superstar arrived. In what many have called a ""historic"" show, Madonna impressed the audience with multiple set and costume changes and light displays. The singer performed some of her greatest hits, including Nothing Really Matters, Like a Prayer and Vogue, and was joined on stage at one point by Brazilian singer Anitta. There were giant screens located along the beach, to ensure the largely Brazilian crowd was able to see the event unfold. Some watched from apartments or hotels, others from boats. There was also a large police presence to ensure the safety of all those in attendance. T-shirts, souvenirs and billboards with Madonna's face decked the neighbourhood as excitement built ahead of the concert. Since she burst onto the UK charts with Holiday in 1984, Madonna has scored another 71 hits, including 13 number one singles. Some, like Vogue, Like A Prayer and Ray of Light, are era-defining anthems. Others, like Live To Tell and Don't Tell Me, are beloved fan favourites. Last year, the superstar was found unconscious in her New York apartment in June and rushed to hospital, where she received treatment for a serious bacterial infection. But she has since returned to full strength and her tour has been marked by her characteristically energetic performances. The Rio concert was the final touch on a tour made up of 80 shows across Europe and North America.",2024-05-05,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68961409,entertainment
157,The 'delicious irony' of the Met Gala's Garden of Time theme,"In JG Ballard's dystopian story The Garden of Time – which has inspired this year's dress code – the super-rich hide themselves in Arcadian splendour while the ""great unwashed"" riot. It seems an unlikely choice of theme for fashion's event of the year. The title of JG Ballard's 1962 short story The Garden of Time has an elegiac romanticism to it. Images immediately stir, visions of flowers and vines springing forth. Depending on the bent of your imagination, those visions may err towards tidy blooms or overgrown thickets, perpetual splendour or the endless cycles of death and growth so necessary for even the smallest pocket of paradise. After all, a garden is time incarnate, bound by the slow march of the seasons. But what kind of garden is this? Do the normal rules of chronology apply? This year, fashion's annual extravaganza the Met Gala has taken Ballard's title as its dress code. The theme has been chosen to complement The Costume Institute's exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, an exploration of the many items held within the Met's archives that are now too fragile to be worn. Reanimated using technologies including X-rays, AI and soundscapes, these artefacts are interspersed with iconography related to the natural world, the combination promising to ""serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal."" It's an odd pairing. Perhaps asking the Gala's attendees to embark on further reading before they attend is setting them up to fail (see the various interpretations of ""camp"" in 2019 that would have had Susan Sontag smashing her Tiffany lamps in protest), but for anyone who does choose to dig deeper, the choice of Ballard's short story may prove puzzling. It relays the tale of Count Axel and his Countess wife who live in a magnificent hilltop villa, surrounded by their gardens. These gardens, where ""the air seemed brighter, the sun seemed warmer"" hold a series of ""time flowers"" – translucent growths with crystal hearts. When plucked, that crystal core dissolves, emitting the light trapped within. ""Strange shifts momentarily transformed the evening, subtly altering its dimensions of time and space,"" Ballard writes. ""The darkened portico of the house, its patina of age stripped away, loomed with a curious spectral whiteness as if suddenly remembered in a dream."" The flowers can slow the clock, but they cannot stop it. So far, so fitting for an exhibition concerned with historical clothing that embodies time without being immune to it. After all, garments are vulnerable, affected by heat, sweat, pressure, stains, moths, storage methods and so on. The job of the archivist is to attempt as much preservation as possible, suspending the usual process of decay even if it cannot be staunched entirely – conserving history so that future generations can maintain some connection with the products of the past. However, Count Axel is not picking his precious flowers for the thrill of it. On the horizon, an army advances, ""a vast confused throng of people, men and women, interspersed with a few soldiers in ragged uniforms, pressing forward in a disorganised tide"". While the Countess plays Mozart on her harpsichord, and the Count tends to his library, this crowd draws ever closer, threatening destruction on their arrival. Each flower delays the inevitable, pushing the crowd back slightly. But there are only so many flowers, and no more are growing. The villa's days are numbered, husband and wife living in an exquisite glass prison. To briefly spoil the ending, when the mob finally reaches the edge of the gardens, they find only crumbling relics: the lawns overrun with weeds, the house full of rotting doors and caved-in floors. On the terrace there stand two statues protected by belladonna-laced thorn bushes. The stone woman clutches a rose; an Ovidian vision of protected permanence sprung forth from the land, saved from the ravages of time. Commentators writing breezy accounts of this year's costume theme have focused on the metaphorical significance of Ballard's story, pointing to its exploration of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction (the fact that one of the top-ranked explainers on Google from 2016 uses that exact wording is, I'm sure, complete coincidence.) Although this holds some truth, it does seem to deliberately ignore a more obvious point. This is a short story in which the last bastion of rich, refined beauty – with its classical music, rare books, and its lovely clothing – is overrun by a working-class mob. ""Some laboured under heavy loads suspended from crude yokes around their necks; others struggled with cumbersome wooden carts, their hands wrenching at the wheel spokes,"" Ballard writes.  The mob is variously described as a tide, a nightmare, and a minor detail from a Goya painting. More like this: It's a jarring image in the context of an event that is a celebration of affluence, excess and rarefied beauty, where a table for the evening sells for $300,000, and an invite bestows an exclusive glitter of Vogue-approved importance on the attendee; perhaps acutely so, when set against the backdrop of global volatility and economic uncertainty, the divisions between safety and danger, wealth and poverty feeling ever starker. Under those circumstances, what on Earth are we to make of this theme based on a story that, regardless of where its loyalties lie, features the destruction of high culture by an undifferentiated mass of humanity? In its evocation of beauty on the brink of ruin, who does it disdain? Any discussion of wealth and exclusivity in the context of the Met Gala is a little plus ça change . Events like this have always been for the privileged few. Similarly, given the consistency of world inequality, contrasting celebrities parading in expensive gowns with images of abject poverty is nothing new (and it is worth pointing out that these expensive gowns do generate a lot of jobs). That said, it is rare to have a dress code that manages to touch on that inequality quite so explicitly before immediately burying it again beneath predictions of attendees wearing ""melancholic florals"". Those contrasting images often rub shoulders in an age where they might pop up one after the other on an Instagram story: the same tools that have made the Met Gala so phenomenally popular also enhance our proximity to suffering the world over. In 2023, the Met Gala generated 12.3 billion impressions for Vogue's channels under the hashtag #metgala, while the event's livestream generated 53 million views across Vogue's various social platforms and global markets. We live in an age of visual saturation, where tragedy and beautiful distractions crowd in on all sides, clamouring for our attention. The Gala itself has been around since 1948, when fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert (a busy woman who was also responsible for the inception of New York Fashion Week) put on a midnight fundraising dinner costing $50 a head. In the 1970s, shrewd Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland introduced costume themes, cementing the event as a crucial part of the socialite calendar, and ensuring a steady stream of funding for the Costume Institute. However, although it's gone from strength to strength under Anna Wintour's gaze, it's really only been in the past decade or so that the Met Gala has played a pivotal role in popularising the idea of fashion as mass entertainment – aided, of course, by enormous advances in social media. It has become the red carpet to end all red carpets, a chance for the whole world not invited to the costume party to enjoy judging its attendees on how gorgeous, inventive and fitting (in all senses of the word) their outfits are. And just with other forms of mass entertainment, it is both extremely enjoyableand extraordinarily lucrative. According to LaunchMetrics , last year the Gala accrued nearly $1 billion in media-impact value for the various brands involved – and a nice packet of publicity for everyone in attendance. It would be interesting to know how the Ballard short story first came to the table. Was it just a neat title? Or is someone in the committee's midst trying to foment class rebellion? Perhaps the dystopian premise is part of a fiendish plan to get people talking – after all, no publicity is bad publicity for the Met Gala. It welcomes controversy, whether it's Kim Kardashian wearing Marilyn Monroe’s famous ""Happy Birthday, Mr President"" dress or Doja Cat attending dressed as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat Choupette, speaking only in meows. This may be too generous a reading though, given that the fashion world loves a reference shorn of complexity. There are some interesting parallels with the 1927 silent film Metropolis, another fashion favourite that has inspired designers including Thierry Mugler , which features a paradisical garden quite literally built above the working masses. At the very least, we can hope that Iris van Herpen brings a thoughtful interpretation. Whatever the reasoning, there's a certain, delicious irony found in invoking Ballard at the Met Gala. The Garden of Time belongs to the earlier, most science fiction-oriented part of his career, which sprawled in all sorts of directions over the decades but retained a consistently bleak interest in the apocalyptic atmosphere of modernity and its uncertain future: frequently invoking urban hellscapes, wide-scale global destruction, mass media, the cult of celebrity, the thin line between spectacle and violence, and identities configured through consumerism.  In an essay written for Vogue in the 1970s, he even predicted the rise of social media: ""Every one of our actions during the day, across the entire spectrum of domestic life, will be instantly recorded on video-tape. In the evening we will sit back to scan the rushes, selected by a computer trained to pick out only our best profiles, our wittiest dialogue, our most affecting expressions filmed through the kindest filters, and then stitch these together into a heightened re-enactment of the day."" One wonders what he would have made of his own work being amplified and distorted in such a context, his words becoming the backdrop to a fluttering cornucopia of florals, each outfit paraded on the first Monday in May a blooming display of finery hiding a complex network of roots – sponsorship deals, brand calculations, dedicated craftsmanship, exposure opportunities – beneath its pretty skirts. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

158,Eurovision 2024: Your guide to all 37 songs,"Olly Alexander is trapped in a post-apocalyptic boxing gym, aboard a spaceship hurtling towards earth in 1985. A “goth gremlin goblin witch” is holding a candlelit séance and summoning the spirit of a minotaur. Nemo (the singer, not the fish) has skinned a muppet and is cavorting around in its skin, while singing Mozart’s Queen Of The Night. It can only be the Eurovision Song Contest. Sometimes I think the competition is out of surprises, an echo chamber of its former glories, then along comes a year like 2024 to prove that (a) Eurovision is as magical and moving and weird and emotional as it’s ever been and (b) I’m an idiot. After weeks of intensive rehearsals, the action kicks off in Malmö, Sweden, this Tuesday with the first of two semi-finals. The winner will be decided on Saturday, 11 May.  To help you prepare, here’s a guide to all 37 songs in the contest – which I’ve sorted into barely-coherent musical categories, because everyone needs a system. The success of Käärijä’s mutant rave-rap anthem Cha Cha Cha at last year’s contest has unlocked something potent. Everywhere you look in Malmö, there’s a sense of musical experimentation and outré risqué performance. Top of the heap is Croatia’s Baby Lasagna , whose ridiculously catchy Rim Tim Tagi Dim is currently the bookmakers' favourite to win. Loud and aggressive and memorable and fun, it blends elements of rock and techno to tell the story of a farm boy saying goodbye to his milking stool and setting out for the big city. According to singer Marko Purišić, the lyrics are a reference to the brain drain that’s affecting Croatia’s economy. Another strong contender Switzerland’s Nemo, whose song The Code is a hare-brained hybrid of pop, opera and electro. Inspired by Nemo’s childhood experience as an opera singer, it uses elements of Bizet’s Carmen and Mozart’s The Magic Flute to explain how they came to terms with their non-binary identity. It’s surprisingly intense. Finland’s Windows95Man, on the other hand, is trying too hard to stand out, emerging from a giant egg and dancing around in his underpants. But all the antics aren’t enough to distract from the fatally generic Europop of his song, No Rules . I’m much more enamoured by Joost Klein from the Netherlands who takes a whistle-stop, happy hardcore tour of Europe in the infectiously silly Europapa . Performed in high-rise shoulderpads, while LED screens project images of currywurst and paella, the song is nonetheless rooted in tragedy. Joost lost his parents at a young age, and the song reflects that no matter how far he travels, he can’t outrun his grief. Pull on your dancing trousers, because Eurovision is ready to party. There are a ton of uptempo dance-pop numbers this year, led (gasp) by the UK’s entrant, Olly Alexander . Formerly of the pop band Years and Years, his bubbling synthpop anthem, Dizzy , recalls Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive by way of The Pet Shop Boys. Instantly memorable, if a little undercooked, the song has risen to 10th place in the odds after rehearsal footage was released this week , showcasing some memorable choreography and a revamped ending to the song. But he faces stiff competition, as pop fans are spoilt for choice this year. Cypriot entrant Silia Kapsis , for example, channels Janet and Britney with her infectiously bombastic song, Liar . Her lyrics could do with some work (“The only problem in this room is about you”) but the breath-taking dance routine will be popular with voters. Not to be outdone on the choreography, Malta’s Sarah Bonnici does the splits and a somersault during her performance. But her song, Loop , is paper-thin, and languishes in last place with bookmakers. By contrast, Spanish duo Nebulossa have already had a viral hit with their song, Zorra . The title translates as both “vixen” and “bitch” and the lyrics are a commentary on the double standards women face. It’s a shimmering piece of 80s candy-pop that’s good enough to eat. Meanwhile, five-time Eurovision winners Luxembourg are back in the competition for the first time in 31 years, represented by Tali Golergant . She punches above her weight with Fighter , a vibey, syncopated pop slammer whose chorus sticks in your head like a sausage on a fork. Looming over the competition like a pop Godzilla is Albanian diva Besa . Her song, Titan , has an appropriately gargantuan hook and a thrilling tempo-switch at the end. Her bright blue bodysuit seems to have been inspired by Steps' video for Deeper Shade of Blue. And why not? It's a classic. Rounding out the field are Iceland’s Hera Björk with Scared Of Heights and Polish singer Luna with The Tower. Both songs are both perfectly accessible, radio-friendly pop – but I suspect they’ll struggle to survive the semi-finals. Eurovision wouldn’t be Eurovision without a raven-haired diva over-emoting about her personal struggles, and this year is no exception. Israel’s Eden Golan has the best of the bunch – a stirringly emotional piano ballad called Hurricane , in which a woman mourns the end of a love affair. Originally called October Rain, the song was rewritten at the request of organisers . The initial lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of 7 October and were rejected for breaking rules on political neutrality. Golan’s participation is causing controversy, however, amid the Israel-Gaza war, and there are pro-Palestinian marches planned in Malmö throughout Eurovision week. The singer has reportedly been confined to her hotel room outside of rehearsals. Could that affect her performance? Maybe. Serbia’s song, Ramonda , is another strong contender, with war references of its own. The title refers to the flower that people wear in remembrance of Serbia’s soldiers in World War One, and singer Teya Dora delivers the sorrowful lyrics with a beautifully understated delivery. Dialling up the histrionics is Slovenian contestant Raiven , whose song Veronika is a bit too piercing for my tastes. I prefer In The Middle , by Moldova’s Natalia Barbu . It boasts a catchy Arabian-style post-chorus - but it doesn’t feel like a finalist, either. Elsewhere, Portugal’s iolanda has submitted the pretty, melodic ballad Grito , which opens with an arresting a capella, but loses direction towards the end. I don’t know why, but several of this year’s contestants are in thrall to the sounds of Ibiza, circa 1992. Squelchy acid synths and brutally aggressive kick drums are all the rage. And why not? Eurovision is only one night, but the acts tour the club circuit for the rest of the year. Having a guaranteed floor-filler in your setlist makes good business sense. Taking it all incredibly literally is Austria’s Kaleen , and her unequivocally titled We Will Rave . With shades of Madonna’s Hung Up and the wordless “ roma-ah-ah ” hooks of Bad Romance, it’s a pulse-quickening banger. Defending Eurovision champions Sweden are sending chart-topping pop twins Marcus & Martinus to Malmö with a squonking, bass-heavy track called Unforgettable. Their staging is incredible – full of pulsing LED screens and body-popping choreography – making them credible contenders. Another fan favourite is Silvester Belt, whose simmering house track Luktelk (Wait) went straight to number one on Lithuania’s Spotify chart. A more subdued and moody track, it’s all about someone who appears happy and functional in public while struggling in private. His early rehearsals don’t seem too promising, but the song already has lots of fans. There’s a refreshing trend this year of countries using ancient musical traditions for inspiration – producing many of my favourite songs in the line-up. Top billing goes to Greek singer Marina Satti , whose avant-garde sound collage Zari mixes traditional Greek melodies with tabla drums, a reggaeton beat, broken vocal samples and a solo on an ancient Persian pipe called the Zurna. “ I’m gonna do it my way ,” she declares, in the year’s most on-the-nose lyric. Armenian band Ladaniva are just as ambitious, blending the ethnic music of Armenia, India and the Balkans with a Western “kick ass and take down names later” attitude. Their song, Jako , is the shortest in the competition but they make it count, putting on one of the most joyous, spirited performances on the Malmö stage. Norwegian folk act Gåte go in the opposite direction, with a dark and gruesome tale of revenge that’s ripped from the pages of the country’s folklore. The lyrics of Ulveham tell the story of a “fair and sightly maiden” whose evil stepmother banishes her to the forest and curses her with “skin like a grey wolf”. By the end of the song, she’s gone feral - tearing out her stepmother’s heart and drinking her brothers’ blood. Remind me never to take a picnic in the Norwegian woods. A less successful hybrid is the combination of didgeridoo and banging house beats on One Milkali by Australian act Electric Fields – although the song deserves merit for including lyrics in the indigenous language of Yankunytjatjara, the first time a dialect of Australia’s First People will feature at Eurovision. Azerbaijan’s Fahree also branches out, including traditional Azeri mugham vocals from singer Ilkin Dovlatov on their entry, Özünlə Apar , but the song has little else to recommend it. Estonia have more fun, submitting two bands for the price of one, with 5MIINUST x Puuluup . The latter is a nu-folk act, famous for their skills on the Talharpa, a rare wooden lyre from northern Europe. The former is a hip-hop group, who deliver dense, humorous lyrics about a drugs bust on the song with the longest-ever title at Eurovision: “We (really) don’t know anything about (these) drugs”. Finally, we have Italian iconoclast Angelina Mango , who serves up a delectable mix of reggaeton, cumbia and Latin soul on her song La Noia . The title actually translates as “boredom” but, with its curlicued guitar lines and restlessly evolving melodies, you'd have to be stony of heart to find it less than invigorating. I can’t recommend it highly enough. Lordi and Måneskin proved that rock has a place at Eurovision, and the tradition continues this year, with three acts clinging onto distortion pedals for dear life. Most memorable is Ireland’s Bambie Thug , the only singer who’s bringing a screaming coach to Sweden. The musician describes their sound as “Ouija-pop” and, for the uninitiated, that means a blend of gothic electro, angst-ridden pop and screamcore, which has unsettled some conservative critics in their homeland. Fittingly, their song, Doomsday Blue , is about having your potential overlooked, and the marginalisation of the queer community. It’s an acquired taste, but is the boldest song on this year’s line-up. San Marino’s Megara bravely match Bambie for intensity, with the stomping electro-rock of their entry 11:11 . Reminiscent of Republica’s Ready To Go, the song is inspired by the knock-backs and rejections the band have suffered on the road to fame. In the post-chorus, they spell out the phrase M-E-L-A-P-E-L-A (“I don’t care”), adding: “ If you don't love me/ Other people will love me. ” Enough said. And if it's pop-punk you’re after, Czech singer Aiko has you covered. Her track, Pedestal , was co-written by Steve Ansell of the Brighton band Blood Red Shoes, which explains it’s debt to British indie. Triumph over adversity is the biggest cliché in the Eurovision lyric book – but in the right hands, it can be surprisingly effective. France’s Slimane , for example, sounds on the verge of tears as he begs his lover to come back to Paris on the «chanson dramatique» Mon Amour . Over the border in Belgium, Mustii confronts his anxieties with genuine conviction on the rabble-rousing Before The Party’s Over. Ukraine, meanwhile, continue their Eurovision hot streak with the powerful and solemn ballad Teresa and Maria . Performed by Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil , the lyrics are a plea for protection, addressed to the Christian saints Mother Theresa and Virgin Mary. Written while Russian missiles fall on Ukraine, it’s hard not to read the lyrics as a reference to the war – and the two performers (a kindergarten teacher-turned-rapper and a  famous YouTube singer) have no trouble conveying the urgency and desperation of their situation. Hoping to reverse Germany’s last-place finish in 2023 is gravel-voiced singer-songwriter Isaak . He sings about overcoming his demons on the propulsive Always On The Run – whose galloping beats and gospel overtones make him sound like a German Rag N’ Bone Man (Lumpenhändler Mann?) Bringing up the rear, we have Danish singer Saba and Latvia’s Dons , employing well-worn metaphors about “crying rivers” and “breathing underwater” on their tracks Sand and Hollow . You won’t need to worry about them beyond the semi-finals. And last of all, there’s Georgia’s magnificently-named Nutsa Buzaladze , whose song Firefighter opens with a peal of thunder and recycles a bunch of Eurovision lyrics about rising from the ashes like a phoenix. She’s hard to discount, though. A contestant on last year’s American Idol – where she performed with Kylie Minogue – Nutsa has stage presence to spare and Shakira-level choreography. It should be just enough to transcend the limitations of her song and rise (like a phoenix!) to the finals. See you in Malmö.",2024-05-05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgy7l6er7vo,entertainment
159,Teen's 300 historical outfits share 'forgotten' stories,"A North Yorkshire schoolgirl has become a social media star after handmaking hundreds of historical outfits highlighting ""forgotten women's stories"". Eleanor Shenderey, 16, posts photos of herself wearing her costumes, and has 59,000 followers on TikTok. The schoolgirl sometimes wears the clothes while visiting historic houses, and is frequently asked to have her photo taken with other visitors. ""I often take the dresses with me because I just think - why not? If you've got this gorgeous backdrop, why would you not want to immerse yourself in it and get dressed up?"" Eleanor was taught to sew by her grandmother, who was an art and textiles teacher. She began sewing historical costumes in 2020: ""I just haven't really stopped. I think I've just been inspired by all the beautiful things that I've seen."" Among her inspirations is the TV show Bridgerton: ""It's such a new type of period drama because it's not what you're used to seeing. I think it's really interesting,"" she says. The first historical piece she made was a Tudor gown, crafted out of her parents' old curtains: ""I said, 'I'll take those!'... and it's just gone from there,"" she recalls. Some outfits can take a month to complete. ""It just depends on the complexity of the costume. So, for example, if I was going to make a Regency dress, I can usually get that done within a few days - or up to a week. ""But later Victorian dresses, such as bustle dresses, have so many layers to them, and they're so much more complicated to make, that it can take me up to a month."" Storing the dresses can be a challenge, however, having made some 300 outfits to date. ""We don't have a spare room anymore - I've got all my costumes in there!"" she exclaims. She has not kept all 300 dresses though. Some have been sold, and others have been dismantled and remade into other costumes: ""If I'm not going to wear it, there's no use in it sitting around in the box."" Currently she is busy making her prom dress, but says it will not be a period piece. ""It's going to be more modern. It's not a very interesting dress: It has a corset bodice and a short skirt - so it's not the usual big costume."" Eleanor is fascinated by history and fashion, and finds fashion to be an accessible way of telling stories. ""I think part of the reason I make the dresses is to tell this visual and social history, ""Especially for women in the past, so much of how they communicated is through what they wore and how they presented themselves,"" says Eleanor, who is considering a career as a historian, or in curation. ""It's something I'm really interested in doing. Even if it's not solely focused on fashion, I think fashion will always play a part in it, especially because I'm so passionate about telling forgotten women's stories,"" she says.

160,Rewilded park's birdsong inspires artists,"Music inspired by the birdsong from a rewilded 3,500-acre park in West Sussex has been created by two artists. The Knepp Estate in Horsham, West Sussex - just 20 miles from Gatwick - has been hailed by David Attenborough as a pioneering rewilding project where wildlife now thrives. Composer Damian Montagu and Hazel Reeves, a field-recording artist and sculptor,  have created a piece called Knepp Dawn. Ms Reeves regularly records the sounds of nature in the park, which is home to nightingales, turtle doves, peregrine falcons, ravens, red kites and skylarks . In the early 2000s, the owners of Knepp, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, decided to rewild their land . Last year, Ms Tree told the BBC how they removed fences so animals could roam, allowed hawthorn, blackthorn, dog rose and brambles to take off and left oak saplings to regenerate. The release of Knepp Dawn on Saturday has been timed to highlight International Dawn Chorus Day on Sunday. The event, which is promoted by wildlife trusts on the first Sunday in May each year, sees people getting up early to listen to birdsong at daybreak and celebrate the natural phenomenon. Ms Tree said she was delighted Knepp's dawn chorus had inspired the musical tribute. She said: ""The human response to what we hear in nature is a celebration in itself and reminds us that we, too, are part of nature's tapestry."" Mr Montagu has said it was Ms Reeves's recordings of Knepp’s dawn chorus, including ""the very distinctive isolated sounds of nightingales, cuckoos, turtle doves, and white storks"" that compelled him to write the track. Ms Reeves, whose sculptures include Manchester's statue of Emmeline Pankhurst and the statue of railway engineer Sir Nigel Gresley at King's Cross, said Knepp showed ""how nature can bounce back"".

161,Vast collection of Ladybird classics 'coming home',"Hundreds of privately owned vintage Ladybird books that became the ""backdrop"" of a collector's childhood are to go on show in her home town. Helen Day, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, has lovingly collected and researched the classic pocket-sized works for more than 20 years. She said the ""beautiful pictures"" that explained historical events and fairy tales ""had such a big impression on me as a child"". ""They were the backdrop of my childhood, used for school projects and given as birthday presents, they were just always there,"" she added. Ms Day, who now lives in Harpenden, said the touring exhibition first started in 2018 in Canterbury, but it was always her ambition to ""bring it home"". She said her devotion to the titles was instilled by her parents, who were both teachers. ""To me, they were beautiful pictures of the history of Elizabeth I, Nelson, fairy tales like Cinderella, they were the pictures that had such a big impression on me as a child,"" she added. Ms Day said she owned thousands of Ladybird books, but ""literally I do not know how many"". The books were originally printed by the Loughborough company, Wills & Hepworth, who then published the first volume under the Ladybird title in 1940. The small, illustrated books continued until the mid-1970s, when Ladybird was sold to Penguin Books, she said. The books' distinctive size came about during World War Two's paper shortages. ""Someone discovered if you took the largest sheet of paper, that was around at the time, and you laid it out really carefully and folded it and cut it really economically, you could make a small-sized children's book out of just one sheet of paper,"" Ms Day said. ""That's the accident that caused the magic of that Ladybird formula that so many of us will remember."" The durability of the cover was also part of its success, Ms Day added. ""They were strong little books, not only were they good quality, but they did not fall apart so they stayed on shelves for years and years and schools didn't throw them out and parents gave them to their kids, and so on and so on,"" Ms Day said. She cannot name her favourite book, but said that at the age of four she remembered it was Little Red Riding Hood, as she was given it as a birthday present. ""Most of the history books were about men, just a few were about women, so I spent my pocket money on those, I remember Elizabeth I becoming my heroine,"" she said.

162,Museum director 'reunited' with Renaissance painting,"A museum director is being ""reunited"" with a Renaissance painting which is being borrowed for the first time from the National Gallery. Luke Syson, director at the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University, used to work at the National Gallery where he cared for the Venus and Mars piece by Sandro Botticelli. The piece will be on display from Friday 10 May to Tuesday 10 September in Cambridge in celebration of the National Gallery's 200th birthday. He said: ""It's not just for people that already know and love Botticelli. We are showing a picture that can really make it about them but also about now."" This is the first time in 150 years since its acquisition in 1874, that the painting has left the National Gallery and will be seen by new audiences outside of London. Mr Syson said: ""I used to work at the National Gallery… for me this is something of a reunion which for me makes it a particularly nice part of the story. ""It gives the opportunity for museums across the country to give a new context, ask new questions bring new audiences and visitors to see works that are some of the most celebrated in the world."" He said the mystery and beauty of the painting was as ""compelling as any great poem"". ""It's as close to a poem in paint as you can get… like lots of poetry it doesn’t tell one clear story, it suggests all sorts of possibilities,"" he said. The painting is one of 12 paintings from the National Gallery's collection to go on display at museums and galleries across the United Kingdom. He said: ""Objects belong to the moment they are born but then they belong to every period afterwards and what we bring to them is just as important as what the artists intended.""

163,I Kissed A Girl: Dating show contestants on finding love and friends,"Last summer, I Kissed A Boy made history as the UK's first gay dating show. Now it's the girls' turn. I Kissed A Girl - as you might have guessed - puts a cast of lesbian and bisexual women at the centre. Ten contestants are shacked up in an Italian villa and, as the title suggests, they're introduced with a kiss. Like its predecessor it will be hosted by Dannii Minogue, but this time it's TikTokker Charley Marlowe stepping in to the voiceover booth. The contestants on the show come from a range of backgrounds, and BBC Newsbeat spoke to three - Priya, Amy and Demi - about their journeys before the show. Priya is a Sikh, and says she's been fortunate to feel embraced by her religion, something she speaks about on the show. ""Just because you're queer doesn't mean you can't be religious,"" she says. ""I just think your own relationship with God is very personal and you don't have to share that with anyone else."" By speaking about her own experiences it on the programme, Priya hopes to encourage ""other South Asian and queer women to feel comfortable with who they are"". ""It might be different for other people, but I'm a Sikh,"" she explains. While some Sikhs face homophobia and there are opposing views on same-sex marriage within the religion, Priya says she follows the interpretation of love as something that exists on a spiritual rather than physical level. ""Basically, the religion is just like falling in love with a soul,"" she says. ""It's not necessarily a gender, or a person, but a soul. ""I think that's really beautiful. ""And that's why I love the religion so much and I do speak about it on the show."" But Demi had a more difficult time coming out to her family. She has a Nigerian background, and same-sex activity is illegal in the country. While she says she was able to casually drop the fact she liked girls in to conversation, Demi says she hasn't spoken to her dad since appearing on the show. ""He made suggestions that I'd go back to the villages in Nigeria where they didn't really accept queer people - so that was very hurtful at the time,"" she says. ""And then, since I also told him that I was going on the show, we haven't spoken. ""So yeah, I think it's difficult. But I'm 24 - it doesn't affect me as much as it would have, like, in my youth. It's fine."" Demi says she has a strong support network thanks to her mum and sister and new friends from the show. ""Even when all that happened with my dad, I felt still quite safe, because of my friends,"" she says. Amy has two sisters who are gay, and says she's been out to her family for a few years now. But she says being on the show will still be interesting because a lot of people at home don't know about her sexuality. ""Growing up, I found it quite difficult,"" she says. ""So they're going to see my face and hear my voice, which is going to be quite an experience."" She says her sisters would have loved to see a show like I Kissed A Girl when they were younger. ""If we had that growing up, that would have been such an amazing thing to see,"" she says. Amy says she hopes the show will challenge another preconception lots of LGBT females face - how they're expected to look. ""I had different kind of levels of what I would consider masculine, feminine, and then going in and meeting all these new people completely changed that,"" she says. ""It's really just knocking down that binary."" Demi and Priya say that one of the biggest challenges they face is people assuming they're heterosexual because they present as more feminine. ""They assume you're not a lesbian, because of the way you look,"" Priya says. ""I feel like we're all femme here,"" Demi says. ""So I think everyone comes to the assumption that we're not looking for other women or non-binary people."" Whether they find love or not will be revealed on the show, but all the contestants say the show has helped them make ""friends for life"". ""I had no gay friends, like the only people I knew who were gay were the women I dated,"" Priya says. ""And coming into that environment, meeting all these amazing, colourful, beautiful women and building friendships with each and every one of them is so amazing. ""And I'm gonna have queer friends for life."" Amy says meeting the other girls on the show, who come from all over the UK, gave her the chance to meet people she never normally would. ""So it's just adding just layers and layers and layers to my chosen family,"" she says. ""And it's amazing."" I Kissed a Girl will begin on BBC iPlayer on 5 May. Episodes will air on BBC Three every Sunday and Monday night at 9pm. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68928538,entertainment
164,Inside No. 9: Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith on proving TV bosses wrong,"From bone-chilling thrillers to hilariously dark comedies, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's anthology has managed to shock and surprise viewers for the past decade. Ahead of the ninth and final season of Bafta award-winning Inside No. 9, they have been reflecting on the show's history, and it wasn't always plain sailing. ""There have definitely been times where TV executives have thought we can't achieve certain things, but we've always proved them wrong,"" explains 56-year-old Pemberton. The pair haven't been afraid to experiment over the years, having produced an entirely silent episode, one all in iambic pentameter and now, in the final series, an episode filmed from a doorbell camera. Pemberton remembers one particular episode that bosses said would never work. ""We wrote an episode where all the characters were filmed talking into a fixed cameras, and to prove that it would work, we directed it ourselves. ""It actually ended up being one of the most gripping episodes we've ever made."" The episode, Thinking Out Loud, was praised highly by critics, and is often included in a roundup of best episodes. The i newspaper awarded the episode five stars and Sarah Hughes wrote that it ""pulled the rug from underneath its audience's feet"". The actors also said bosses weren't too sure about the format of the show when they first suggested it. ""When we first pitched the idea of an anthology format with individual stories lasting 30 minutes, it felt radical and wasn't very well received,"" explains Shearsmith. ""But now the tide has turned,"" he says, with the likes of Charlie Brooker's TV show Black Mirror proving successful, with seven nominations at this year's TV Baftas . In total, Pemberton and Shearsmith, who previously worked together on black comedy show A League of Gentleman, have written 55 standalone episodes of Inside No. 9 which can be watched in any order. The duo credit the success of the show to the variety of genres it crosses and the self-contained nature of each episode. Shearsmith says people are now more interested in commitment-free TV instead of drawn-out series with convoluted plots and too many characters. Pemberton describes the series as ""a box of chocolates and one of them is poison"". ""Sometimes you think the story is one genre and then halfway through it turns into another,"" he says. ""It does so well because you never know what you're going to get."" Previous series have been met with a positive response from critics, with the eighth one receiving five stars from Carol Midgley at The Times , who described it as ""exquisite"". And the pair definitely have pulled off some pretty impressive stunts over the years. In 2018 their Halloween special episode tricked viewers into thinking the live show had run into technical difficulties so an old episode would air instead. It turned out the technical difficulties were actually all planned and part of the spooky twist. But the problem with these kind of stunts and tricks is that they can only be done once. Regular Inside No. 9 viewers know to always think outside the box and expect the unexpected. So how do the writer and actor duo continuously manage to surprise viewers and deliver some killer (sometimes literally) twists? ""It has become increasingly difficult when people know to watch for red herrings, but we just try and focus on inventing good stories that will hook you quickly and only need 30 minutes to tell,"" says 54-year-old Shearsmith. ""The last 30 seconds of a show shouldn't be everything, it's actually all about the journey,"" he adds. ""The punchline of a joke doesn't make sense without the actual joke."" Pemberton says that it's important for the them to ""plant the seed early"" and says many viewers watch the episodes again, to see all the things they didn't spot the first time round. ""The answer is there all along,"" Pemberton tells the BBC. Speaking about the new series that airs on 8 May, there's not much that Shearsmith and Pemberton will give away. Both say they are ""very cagey"" when it comes to giving out information about the show, as part of its appeal is people don't know what to expect. Pemberton says the films and shows that have stuck with him the most over the years are the ones where he's gone in blind. ""I think if I had read a synopsis or seen a trailer before it would have ruined it for me."" However, the duo are particularly excited about the first episode of the final series, which will be the 50th episode in the anthology. Boo to a Goose sees an ensemble of British actors including Siobhan Finneran and Charlie Cooper all stuck on a late night train that has broken down. ""Every series we do an ensemble piece and we love it, because we put together our favourite actors, trap them together and see what happens,"" Pemberton says. As the series come to an end, the pair say they are feeling a mix of emotions. Shearsmith says he never thought the show would be as successful as it is and is ""delighted"" that it has run for so many years. ""It's not a sad thing that it's ending, in fact it feels like a poetic point to stop at series nine,"" Shearsmith adds. Having produced a range of episodes that are as shocking as they are disturbing, and comic as they are emotional, for Pemberton it feels like ""we have done a lifetime of work in just 10 years"" and both are very proud of leaving something behind.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-68937407,entertainment
165,Baby Reindeer gave star the same feelings as Pride,"Baby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning said reading the script for the Netflix series gave her the same feelings as when she first read the script for Pride. Gunning, who portrays a stalker called Martha in the word-of-mouth hit, previously played Sian James in the 2014 film Pride. Sian was the wife of a striking miner who went on to become the MP for Swansea East. “I had a similar reaction I remember when I read [Pride] for the first time, I was in a café and I just absolutely sobbed,"" Gunning told BBC Radio Wales . “It was just a beautiful thing to be a part of and, I feel, very similar actually to Baby Reindeer."" Pride portrayed an alliance between gay rights’ campaigners and pit workers during the 1984 miners' strike and was largely set in the Dulais Valley in south Wales. “I feel like it’s had such an amazing response and affected so many people, and I am just so proud I got to be a part of it all,"" she said. Gunning, 38, recalled being at the screening of Pride and sitting next to Imelda Staunton. “She [Imelda Staunton] said to me, if we never work again, we can say we were in that film. “What a film - it’s just incredible.” Netflix's Baby Reindeer depicts the true story of a stalker, portrayed by Gunning, who harassed the writer and creator of the series, Richard Gadd, over a number of years. In the series Gunning has a strong Scottish accent , though she actually grew up near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. “I have an amazing accent coach who helped me, and she also helped me with my Welsh accent when I did Pride,” she said.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw94gyldyqxo,entertainment
166,Drake and Kendrick Lamar get personal on simultaneously released diss tracks,"The intensifying feud between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake has reached new heights, with the simultaneous release of two scathing diss tracks. After weeks of back and forth, the new songs get personal, with allegations of domestic violence and secret children. Drake's track, Family Matters, appears to suggest that one of Lamar's children was fathered by another man. Lamar's response, Meet The Grahams, alleges that Drake is addicted to gambling, sex, drugs and alcohol. Drake rejects the claims as a ""shambles"". The two songs, released within minutes of each other on Saturday morning, are much darker than earlier missives in their war of words. Drake, who is the most streamed rapper in the world, casually suggests that Lamar is a perpetrator of spousal abuse, rapping: "" They hired a crisis management team/To clean up the fact that you beat on your queen."" Outside of the song, Lamar has never been accused of any form of domestic violence. Drake also addresses the legal aftermath of his earlier diss track, Taylor Made Freestyle. The song, which used Artificial Intelligence to duplicate the voice of Tupac Shakur, was taken down after a complaint from Shakur's estate. In Family Matters, he accuses Lamar of pulling strings behind the scenes to force that outcome. "" You called the 2Pac Estate/And begged 'em to sue me and get that [expletive] down, "" he says. Lamar wasted no time in retaliating. His song, Meet The Grahams, arrived 20 minutes later, along with the warning: ""You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name"". The Compton-born rapper proceeded to call out Drake's parents, and his six-year-old son, by name. "" Dear Adonis, I'm sorry that that man is your father ,"" he raps in the opening bars. "" Let me be honest, it takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive. "" He later calls Drake a ""deadbeat"" and suggests he has secretly fathered another child. Drake responded to the latter accusation with an Instagram post, stating: ""Hold on, can someone find my hidden daughter and send her to me pls... These guys are in shambles"", accompanied by several laughing emojis. Elsewhere on Meet The Grahams, Lamar repeats allegations that Drake has used ghost writers instead of composing his own verses, and that he has undergone plastic surgery. Lamar also alleges that people on the payroll at Drake's record label OVO are ""sex offenders"". The lyric appears to be a reference to Canadian rapper Baka Not Nice, who began his career as a security guard for Drake, and who was charged in 2014 with forcing a 22-year-old woman into prostitution. The rapper, whose real name is Travis Savoury, pleaded guilty to assault , but the prostitution charges were dropped. Drake and Lamar's feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. During a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had ""tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes"". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop. The feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the ""big three"" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter. Lamar responded with a fiery verse on the song Like That, declaring that there was no ""big three - it's just big me"". Since then, both sides have released a number of diss tracks, with the tension continually ramping up. The fall-out has been good for business, however, with both sides scoring hits in this week's Top 40.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68957553,entertainment
167,Kendrick Lamar’s beef with Drake and J Cole explained,"Rappers have been trading insults since the dawn of hip-hop. It's part of the culture - a test of lyrical skill and a declaration of superiority that has produced hundreds of classic ""diss tracks"", from 2Pac's Hit 'Em Up to Jay-Z's Takeover. The latest beef has erupted between three of hip-hop's biggest stars - Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole - and was triggered by a seemingly innocuous lyric praising their respective careers. Here's a guide to what's happened so far. Drake (above left) - the Canadian actor-turned-musician whose vulnerable blend of rap and R&B has made him the most commercially successful hip-hop artist of the 21st Century. Among his multi-platinum hits are tracks like Hotline Bling, One Dance and Hold On We're Going Home. Kendrick Lamar (centre) - A Compton-born rapper whose compelling rhymes and conceptual vision have seen him named the best rapper of his generation. One of the most inventive lyricists in the game, he tackles big topics like police brutality, black self-worth and his own internal conflicts. In 2018, he became the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for music. J Cole (right) - Born in Germany and raised in North Carolina, J Cole was mentored by Jay-Z and went on to score hits with songs like Middle Child and Deja Vu. But he grew disenchanted with the trappings of commercial success and began to forge his own path with more introspective, analytical songs, resulting in some of the most popular and successful music of his career. When Kendrick Lamar was a young up-and-comer, Drake offered him a helping hand by inviting him onto his Take Care album, and giving him an opening spot on his 2012 Club Paradise Tour. But in 2013, after the success of Lamar's debut album Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, he made his ambitions clear. During a guest verse on Big Sean's Control, he called out Drake, J Cole, Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Pusha T and a host of other rappers, warning them: ""I got love for you all, but I'm trying to murder you."" Asked about the diss, Drake told Billboard Magazine: ""I didn't really have anything to say about it. It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was. ""I know good and well that [Lamar] 's not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic."" The rappers traded a few jibes over the next few years (Lamar memorably boasted that he'd ""tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes"" during the BET hip-hop awards) but it never seemed particularly serious. The initial spark was a gesture towards unity, rather than division. In October last year, Drake released his eighth album For All The Dogs, which featured a collaboration with J Cole called First Person Shooter. In one verse, Cole suggested that he, Drake and Kendrick were the ""big three"" of the current era of hip-hop. ""Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot [Kendrick] ? Is it Aubrey [Drake] ? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league. "" The song debuted at the top of the US singles chart, becoming Drake's 13th and Cole's first number-one song. The achievement meant Drake tied with Michael Jackson for the most number one singles by a male solo artist. A week later, Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer replaced them at number one, and the moment seemed to have passed. But privately, Kendrick had taken note - and he wasn't happy. In March 2024, producer Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You. Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive. With a tightly-wound, expletive-laden delivery, he took aim at Cole's verse, claiming there was no ""big three - it's just big me"". He went on to call Drake and Cole's best verses insubstantial - ""a light pack"" - and declared he was the Prince to Drake's Michael Jackson. The power of the verse can't really be conveyed in print, but when it ends with Lamar promising to put all of Drake and J Cole's ""dogs"" in the ""pet sematary"" - the name of a Stephen King 1983 horror novel - you know a fuse has been lit. (NB: Lamar doesn't mean literal pet dogs, but the rappers' nearest and dearest. The lyric doubles up as a reference to Drake's album title, For All The Dogs) It's worth noting that the placement of Lamar's verse is also significant, as Metro Boomin' is a former Drake collaborator who fell out with the Canadian star. Metro, whose real name is Leland Wayne, produced the majority of Drake's 2015 album What A Time To Be Alive, but a promised sequel never materialised, allegedly leading to bad blood between the pair. In 2022, the producer removed Drake from a song called Trance, and unfollowed him on Instagram. Of course not. Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse in a concert in Florida, with a pugnacious message to the crowd. ""A lot of people ask me how I'm feeling,"" he said. ""I'ma let you know I'm feeling. ""I got my [expletive] head up high, my back straight, I'm 10 [expletive] toes down in Florida and anywhere else I go. And I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this What's Kendrick Lamar’s beef with Drake and J Cole? earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!"" Double of course not! Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, in a track called 7 Minute Drill on his surprise album Might Delete Later. "" I got a phone call, they say that somebody dissing / You want some attention, it come with extension s,"" he rapped. "" He still doing shows but fell off like The Simpson s."" He continued by critiquing Kendrick's discography, calling his debut a ""classic"", but his most recent effort - a sprawling double album called Mr Morale and the Big Steppers - ""tragic"". "" Your third [album] was massive and that was your prime ,"" he continued, "" I was trailing right behind and I just now hit mine. "" He finished up by saying he still respected Lamar, but wouldn't hesitate to destroy him if the insults continued. "" Push come to shove on this mic I will humble him ."" Almost immediately after releasing 7 Minute Drill, Cole realised it had been a huge ""mis-step"". Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song , praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness. ""I ain't gonna lie to y'all the past two days felt terrible,"" he told an audience at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina. He explained that he'd caved into pressure to respond to Lamar's diss, but the result was the ""lamest, goofiest"" thing he'd ever recorded. Vowing to scrub the song from streaming services, he added that he would ""take if on the chin"" if Lamar wanted to respond. As the star rapped on his 2013 track Crunch Time, ""Only thing worse than death is a regret-filled coffin"". Like a true rap arsonist, Drake tried to reignite the fire Cole had extinguished. On April 13, Drake released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists. ""Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/Then we need a verse for the Swifties,"" he cajoled. He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him. ""Pipsqueak, pipe down, you ain't in no big three/SZA got you wiped down/Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down."" He also tagged Future, The Weeknd and Rick Ross in the song. Funny you should ask. Within hours of Drake's diss, Rick Ross shot back in a track called Champagne Moments, alleging the star had undergone plastic surgery - including a nose job, fake abs and a Brazilian Butt Lift. The accusation resulted in Drake's mum texting him to ask if the rumours were true. He shared their exchange on Instagram, marking the point where this rap beef went past its sell-by-date. But it didn't end there. Oh no. On 21 April, Kanye West sided with Kendrick Lamar, releasing a remix of Like That where he took aim at Drake's major label record deal, suggesting he'd been short-changed. And he dismissed Drake and Cole's lyrics, rapping: ""Y'all so out of sight, out of mind/I can't even think of a Drake line"". Meanwhile, Drake tried to goad Lamar into responding, by dropping yet another diss track. Called Taylor Made Freestyle, it suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department. Adding insult to injury, Drake apparently used Artificial Intelligence to deliver two of the voices in the style of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Following complaints from Shakur's estate, the song was removed from Drake's social media feeds . Kendrick finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute diss track at the end of April. Titled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it read like a laundry list of complaints against his sparring partner. Lamar called Drake ""predictable"", a ""master manipulator"" and an ""habitual liar"". He also repeated Rick Ross's dig about Drake's fake abs, and called the star's parenting skills into question. But mostly, he said he really, really didn't like Drake. ""Let me say I'm the biggest hater,"" he rapped. ""I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress."" Drake responded by posting a screenshot of the movie 10 Things I Hate About You, comparing Lamar's lyrics to the teenage poetry recited by one of the characters. Less than 72 hours after dropping Euphoria, Lamar followed up with a second song, called 6:16 in LA. In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information. "" You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it ."" Lamar's accusation that Drake ""don't know nothin'"" about raising a son appears to have rankled. On Saturday 4 May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights. "" You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad ,"" he declared. "" I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad ."" Among the song's most shocking allegations, Drake speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation). Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: "" You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name "". Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members - his mother, his father and his six-year-old son, Adonis. To each of them, he listed a litany of the rapper's supposed failures. Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs. Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his ""hidden daughter"" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a ""shambles"" The war of words shows no signs of subsiding. If anything, the frequency of the star's attacks is increasing. The feud is good for business, however. Both Push Ups and Like That are safely nestled in the US and UK charts, with the latest diss tracks certain to follow. However, there are signs that some listeners are growing tired of the constant back and forth. ""This whole feud has started to reveal itself to be an ouroboros of attention and social-media commentary more than any actual referendum on two rappers' abilities,"" wrote Rolling Stone magazine's senior music editor Jeff Ihaza in an opinion column on 2 May . ""It feels like such a colossal waste of energy.""",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68739398,entertainment
168,Bar singer steps in after Olly Murs cancels support gig for Take That,"It's the break that all musicians dream of. An up-and-coming singer has been credited with saving the day, after standing in for Olly Murs at a Take That gig in Glasgow at the last minute. Daniel Rooney had been playing at a hotel bar in the city when he was asked to step in for Murs, who could no longer make it due to transport issues. Take That's frontman, Gary Barlow, later thanked him on Instagram. ""This young man saved the day, thank you,"" Barlow wrote. He added a picture of Rooney and three love heart emojis. Writing on Instagram, Rooney said the presenter Ross King had spotted him at the Radisson hotel and brought him over to the Hydro. ""Craziest 30 minutes ever,"" he said. ""Also a big thanks to the Take That lads for calming me down before the show and talking setlist tunes. Absolute legends!"" he added. On social media, fans praised Rooney's performance at the Ovo Hydro, with one saying he'd smashed it. Murs, who has been supporting the world famous boy band on their This Life tour, was unable to make the gig after his flight from London was cancelled. He had been updating fans over the day on his Instagram story on his efforts to get to Glasgow. He posted a video from inside the plane before exiting and attempting to board another flight. Eventually, he posted on social media that it wasn't going to happen. ""So sorry to everyone at the Take That show tonight in Glasgow, unfortunately I won't be there,"" the 39-year-old said on X. ""Don't think I've ever missed a gig before, am so annoyed!"" He was taking a car to ensure he made the Saturday and Sunday shows at the Ovo Hydro. After Glasgow, Take That are heading to Manchester for their next gigs. But their five dates next week will now be held at the AO Arena, after they were forced to move from the troubled Co-op Live arena amid a series of ""technical issues"".",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68944555,entertainment

Lord Of The Rings stars Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan took a table at the Belzan bistro on Friday. Chef Sam Grainger said: ""In walked three hobbits and an elf, and literally everyone was gobsmacked."" The actors were set to appear at the Comic Con event at the city's exhibition centre. Mr Grainger said it would have been special “to see one of them, but all of them together” at the Smithdown Road restaurant made it more precious. “Elijah Wood is very, very recognisable - I don’t think he has aged,” he said. Mr Grainger, who appeared in the BBC show Great British Menu last year, described the quartet as “really great, nice guys who had an amazing laugh” and ""nearly ate the whole menu"".

170,Gavin and Stacey home owner braced for more visitors,"The owner of Gwen's house in Gavin and Stacey has said she expects more coach loads of visitors following the announcement that the BBC hit TV show is to make a return for a final episode on Christmas Day . Glenda Kenyon, 70, said her life changed after she answered a letter from the show producers looking for a house on Trinity Street in Barry, the Vale of Glamorgan, in 2006. Her terraced home, set on a steep street overlooking the Bristol Channel, became one of the comedy's main locations which is still visited by regular coach tours. ""I think it's put Barry on the map, she said. ""Since we've had Gavin and Stacey they started building houses, schools. I think that's what we needed."" Glenda's home has had nearly 30,000 visitors, with Gavin and Stacey fans coming from as far away as Australia, Hawaii and India. And could a new episode prompt even more? ""I'm in for it, I am,"" joked Glenda. ""It's bound to get more [busier]."" Glenda, who has lived in Barry for 35 years, said being associated with the comedy has changed her life. When the house is needed, the crew temporarily remove her furniture and replace it with Gwen and Stacey West's interiors - and Glenda is put up in a hotel. What does she want to see in finale? ""I hope they finish off the fishing trip because I am desperate to find out,"" she said. Since the show began in 2007, fans have been sharing their theories on the mystery fishing trip involving Uncle Bryn and his nephew Jason. In the last Christmas special, Bryn and Jason were finally ready to tell the whole family what happened, but they were interrupted. James Corden ended speculation about new Gavin and Stacey material by announcing a final episode of the show will air on Christmas Day. Writing on Instagram , the former talk show host said: ""It's official! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey"". He added: ""See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James."" It confirmed the episode has been written with co-creator Ruth Jones, who has shared an on-screen relationship with Corden in their roles. Viewers will be hoping to find out what has happened between Nessa and Smithy, but also to see how their on-screen son, ""Neil the Baby"", is doing. The final episode could be a bittersweet moment for fans - the 2019 Christmas special was the most watched show in a decade, bringing in more than 17 million viewers . Running for three series between 2007 and 2010, it started off as a BBC Three sitcom but was soon shifted to prime time BBC One. Set in both Essex and Wales, it has become a cult classic, despite only winning a handful of awards at the time; two Bafta TV awards in 2008 and one National Television Award in 2010. It also won a Must-See Moment Bafta in 2020 , voted for by the public, for the moment when Nessa proposed. The show also picked up an impact award at the National Television Awards in 2020 - showing its longevity in the comedy space.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n157rzjd3o,entertainment
171,"The Japanese gown uniting Freddie Mercury, the Jedi and Bjork","Freddie Mercury adored them and collected them as he travelled across Japan on tour. George Lucas put them at the heart of every costume in the Star Wars franchise and they were the favoured backstage dress of Boy George and David Bowie. Now, a collection of Kimono owned by some of entertainment’s most influential personalities has gone on display at an exhibition in Dundee . Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk charts the history of the traditional Japanese dress from its far east origins to the garment’s place in contemporary fashion. More than 300 artefacts, including a collection of the gowns owned and worn by the Queen front man, are featured in the showcase at the V&A until January. The show, which originally opened in London in January, shines a light on their cultural impact in the West – including those in a galaxy far, far away. “You see kimono as being distinctly Japanese, but they also have this universal timeless quality,” said Anna Jackson, curator of the exhibition . “George Lucas was very much inspired by the films of Kurosawa, and at one point it’s believed he considered offering the role of Obi Wan Kenobi to the veteran actor Toshiro Mifune who appeared in Sanjuro. “Mifune didn’t speak English and didn’t think it appropriate so the part went to Alec Guinness but the costumes, part Samurai and part Buddhist monk were inspired by the simple shape of the kimono and I believe the actors referred to them as that, so they knew exactly what they were wearing.” Mifune’s Jedi-inspiring stage costume and Mercury’s favourite cherry blossom gown are among the exhibits on display. The show has been expanded since its London outing for the final stop on its tour. One of the additions is the oldest surviving Japanese robe in the UK.  It belonged to Sir James Dalrymple who added his own family crest to the design, and like many writers and politicians, used his kimono as a house coat or dressing gown when entertaining guests at his home in Newhailes House in Musselburgh in the early 18th century. “It was made in Japan, came to the Netherlands and ended up in Scotland, so it speaks to this amazing cross-cultural connection between Japan and Scotland which stretched back centuries,” said Kirsty Hassard, V&A Dundee curator. Another kimono from the 1920s features a distinctive rose and lattice pattern which echoes the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. “We know Mackintosh didn’t visit Japan but was hugely inspired by what he saw in books,” says Kirsty. “And we think these designers were doing the same, on the other side of the world.” Ms Jackson believes the versatility of kimono is what makes it so enduring. It can be adapted to any shape or size and worn by men or women. In the late 19th century, there was a worldwide craze for Japanese art and design and women started to wear the gowns. “Kimono were exported in large numbers and although you could see it as a sort of cultural appropriation wearing a garment from a country you didn’t really understand, it was also liberating for women who’d been used to wearing corsets,” she said. It was also associated with Bohemianism. The 19th century actress Ellen Terry wore a kimono backstage, when greeting guests in her dressing room. Alexander McQueen helped Bjork create the iconic cover of her 1997 album Homogenic and the film Memoirs of a Geisha fostered even more interest in the garment, while they were also a favourite of the German-American actress and singer Marlene Dietrich. “Freddie Mercury had hundreds of kimono, some of which he wore on stage, but some he wore at home like the one we have in the show. For him it was a way of transcending cultural identity but also sexual identity,” Ms Jackson said. Far from being a traditional unchanging garment, the kimono has continued to evolve, and is enjoying a revival on the streets of Japan thanks to a new generation of contemporary designers and stylists. Here in the UK, it has been a fixture of fashion for more than a century, and the trend continues on the catwalk and at music festivals. Although the show hasn’t been made in-house, it’s an important one for V&A Dundee, which was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma in 2018. “It’s lovely to be hosting it,” said Leonie Bell, director of V&A Dundee “We feel like we’re a little bit of Japan by the banks of the Tay.” V&A Dundee has faced a number of challenges in its short existence, but they’re keen to face them head on, and they believe this ticketed show, on the back of last year’s Tartan exhibition will help enormously. “We’re looking at a global tour of Tartan. That was game changing for us at the V&A,” said Ms Bell. “The thought of seeing it go round the world, and follow it with Kimono feels good. It feels like a demonstration, not just of what V&A Dundee can do, not just what Dundee can do, but what the whole cultural sector in Scotland can do.”",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx7djg3ewlzo,entertainment
172,Artist's work in psychiatric hospitals on show,"The work of an artist who revealed the hidden world of psychiatric hospitals in the later decades of the 20th Century is to be featured in an exhibition. Charles Lutyens was both an artist and art therapist in the 1970s and 1980s, so had access to psychiatric hospitals at a time when they were feared and stigmatised by many. His work led to him to create paintings studying the characters within them, who were often ignored or treated with disdain by the wider world. The free exhibition will open at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in Beckenham, south-east London, on 8 June. Born in 1933, Lutyens trained at various institutions and went on to create works like Angels of the Heavenly Host in St Paul's Church in Bow Common, one of the UK’s largest single-artist mosaics. However, it is the pieces he made during his time as an art therapist that are the focus of A World Apart: The Work of Charles Lutyens. Practised formally since the middle of the 20th Century, art therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its main mode of expression and communication. As a therapist in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Lutyens would create close observations of the characters he met, as well depicting as daily life within the institutions where he worked. Colin Gale, the museum's director, said that Lutyens had ""poured empathy for his subjects into his art through careful rendering and visual metaphor and has drawn on, and depicted, his own feelings. ""As well as documenting aspects of daily life in institutions, Lutyens’ work also comprises a poignant record of human emotion and experience.” The exhibition, based in the 1930s former administration building of Bethlem Royal Hospital, the world’s oldest psychiatric hospital, will run until 31 August.

173,Fans celebrate six decades of Sindy,"She has a passion for fashion, enjoys outdoor living and has hobbies ranging from broadcasting to BBQ - Sindy has lived a full life as she celebrates her 60th birthday. Since her 1960s debut, she has sold more than 150 million dolls worldwide and an exhibition has seen thousands come through its door to see items from two prolific collectors. Two packed rooms in Chippenham Museum are a sea of pink alongside fan merchandise. It has been one of its most successful exhibitions, with visitors from all over the world and there has even been a convention in the town. Sindy turned out to be a force to be reckoned with, especially in Britain, when she came on to the scene in the swinging sixties. She had a different look to rival Barbie and was meant to look more like a teenager. She even had flatter feet. Weekender Sindy was dressed in a jumper and jeans, although she was also a fashion enthusiast. ""The clothes were actually designed by 60s designers - her clothes are what teenagers would want to wear. So they're not flash, they're everyday,"" said Melissa Barnett, from Chippenham Museum , which is holding the exhibition until 11 May. Even though she likes a casual outfit, there has always been more elaborate clothing to collect, like wedding dresses and even a set of costumes designed by the Emanuels, who were behind Princess Diana's wedding dress. However, Ms Barnett explained there is more to Sindy than a passion for fashion. ""Her whole world is very much more about what she's doing rather than about what she's wearing. ""So there's a lot of accessories."" ""If you think about the dolls before then - which were very much babies - this was an iconic doll for teenagers and it did become the bestselling doll by the end of the 60s,"" said Ms Barnett. Sindy has a lot of stories to go with her, including in books and magazines. Plus, friends and family: ""She came with a little sister a couple of years later called Patch - and even a boyfriend. ""Move over Ken [the boyfriend of Barbie], this is Paul, who she met at a local dance,"" Ms Barnett added. A friend of Sindy's, Gayle, was introduced at one point, but only in America. A later version of Sindy tried to appeal to the American market explained Ms Barnett: ""The face goes thinner with bigger eyes, more like Barbie. Later we go back to the rounder face of the original Sindy."" The exhibition shows off the accessories of Sindy as much as the dolls, with collectors Karen Colley and Bonita spending hours setting up scenes, dressing dolls and the houses. The original boxes are stacked underneath, with the differences in design, aspiration and style clear throughout the decades. Sindy was keen on horses too, with the country house having a space to keep her horse and cart underneath. The houses are detailed, with chicken dinners, phones and pets. Always a busy person, other sets include a television studio, hairdressers and camping. ""She was not beholden to Paul in any way I don't think - she was doing her own thing,"" said Ms Barnett from the museum. The manufacturer - Pedigree, based in Exeter - has produced a diamond anniversary doll, with a glittery silver dress and heels. She is being sent out to collectors now, but for those still waiting, the museum was sent one early for the exhibition. Melissa Barnett explained how successful the exhibition has been: ""It's lovely to have a happy exhibition that people can relate to. ""It is one of our most successful exhibitions - over Easter, there were around 150 people a day so for two weeks - that was quite a lot for a small museum."" The nostalgia has been a real draw, with the museum visitor book full of comments, including from someone from Seattle, USA. ""There's people reminiscing - to the point of being quite emotional. Remembering happy times. ""I think the adults have enjoyed it more than the children. It's remembering your past in a good way,"" Ms Barnett. Plenty of people have been taking the opportunity for a picture in the giant Sindy selfie box too. So - Sindy or Barbie? Tough choice. Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook , X and Instagram .

174,Artist's dolls' house protest at housing crisis,"A Brighton artist will be taking part in an open house festival with a portable dolls' house as a protest at the cost-of-living crisis. Bryony Devitt is putting her own spin on Brighton's Artists Open Houses festival, which sees 180 venues and homes open their doors to art and crafts enthusiasts. Ms Devitt said as she cannot buy a house to take part, she will be wheeling around a portable dolls' house in protest. ""I thought I'll find a house that I can afford and I found a dolls' house,"" Ms Devitt said. Ms Devitt, who grew up in Brighton, has always enjoyed the Artists Open Houses festival but felt ""angry"" she could not afford her own house to take part. The artist asked organisers if she could take part with a portable house instead to show how her and her friends were struggling to buy homes. Young people across the country are struggling to get on the property ladder . Ms Devitt hopes the moveable artwork will illustrate the transient nature of renting. ""Your landlord might want the house back or you might have to move because they put up the rent too much,"" the artist said. The average cost of rent in the UK rose by 9% in the 12 months to February this year, according to the Office for National Statistics. The miniature house will be part of the Independent Trail and will be touring parts of Brighton and Hove during the festival. Brighton's Artists Open Houses festival starts on Saturday and will run every weekend until 27 May. Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

175,Exhibition highlights blood cancer symptoms,"A new art exhibition to raise awareness of rare blood cancers is coming to Bristol. It uses sculptures to represent common symptoms with names like 'Feverish Flora' and 'Weight Loss Wendy'. Its drawing attention to blood cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). According to Blood Cancer UK, there are around 4,180 cases of MPN in the UK each year. The exhibition will be on display outside the oncology clinic GenesisCare at Aztec West from 4 May until mid-June. Christine Hamilton, 63, from Bristol, has MPN and is a patient there. She said she was ""thrilled"" that it was coming to her hometown. ""Living with MPN is a lifelong challenge,"" she said. ""Knowledge is power and I really hope the art installation encourages people to take notice of any symptoms or bodily changes, no matter how small and to get it checked out early."" MPNs are a type of blood cancer where your body produces too many of a particular type of blood cell. The three main types are myelofibrosis (MF), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and polycythaemia (PV). The charity MPN Voice is one of the organisations behind the campaign. A spokesperson, Alisia O'Sullivan, said: ""More needs to be done to recognise and identify these symptoms early so that people living with the condition can seek help from medical professionals."" Five artists from across the UK were commissioned to create the ten sculptures. Bristol aerosol artist Spike Clark was one them, making 'Full Up Fred' and 'Night Sweats Nick' He said: ""I’d never heard of MPNs, which is exactly why it is so important we raise awareness of them.” Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook , X and Instagram .

176,Veteran organises exhibition after losing her sight,"A veteran who said her ""world fell apart"" when she suddenly lost most of her sight at work has put together an art exhibition to raise money. Jennie Fuller from Daventry, Northamptonshire, lost her eyesight while serving in the Women's Royal Army Corps. ""When I was first told of my diagnosis, I was devastated [and] extremely worried,"" she said. ""My world fell apart. I feared I would lose my job and my home."" Ms Fuller received support from Blind Veterans UK in 2018, and money raised from the exhibition will be given to the charity. The exhibition will take place on 4 and 5 May at Dodford Village Hall. Ms Fuller, who also served as a police officer in Northampton, now works for Blind Veterans UK. ""Meeting a fellow blind veteran at the Blind Veterans UK Centre of Wellbeing in Llandudno inspired me to challenge myself and get on with life,"" she said. ""That peer support was worth its weight in gold. ""I learnt that just because I'd lost some of my sight, it didn't mean life was over. I just had to accept it and adjust, which was a journey in itself."" The exhibition has been put together by local artists. Ms Fuller said she tried to push herself to continue with things she was passionate about, including painting, cake decorating, drawing and cooking. ""I have no usable sight in one eye, seeing only grey, and limited sight in the other, and therefore have no perspective, so art is challenging,"" she said. ""However, I become totally immersed in what I'm doing when I paint. ""I make the most of what I can do, and I'm open to trying new things. I wake each morning, and as long as I can see the sun, I feel very lucky and very grateful."" Follow Northamptonshire news on Facebook , Instagram and X . Got a story?

177,Richard Ashcroft: 'I was the mouthy lead singer',"""Most of my fame is based on people talking about songs or a gig they went to and a lot of the time, it’s minutes of my time to make someone happy."" As understatements go, Richard Ashcroft’s is something of a whopper. Since he announced his talents with The Verve’s debut album A Storm In Heaven in 1993, his creativity, both while serving as the band’s totemic frontman and as a mercurial solo artist, has delivered a storming and often sensational selection of songs. Few would deny him a little arrogance, not least because his magnum opus, 1998’s Urban Hymns, which spawned four Top Ten singles in the shape of Bitter Sweet Symphony, The Drugs Don’t Work and Lucky Man, remains one of the top 20 biggest-selling albums of all time in the UK, ahead of Adele’s 25, Ed Sheeran's X and U2’s The Joshua Tree. And arrogance, thanks to the much-loved and often parodied video for Bitter Sweet Symphony which saw Ashcroft striding down a street while passers-by bounced off him, is what he has somewhat unfairly become known for. A quarter of a century on from that, the ever-angular and stridently confident Ashcroft admits it was something he played up to at the time. “I was the mouthy lead singer,” he says. “It’s a sport, and there’s levels to it, and you want to be at the top, you want to be the Messi, and you want to be the George Best.” He says it was about doing “everything with conviction”, which was fine “as long as it was not just empty arrogance”. “There was a lot of people that got it wrong and tried but they had nothing to back it up with. “I was like ‘I am going to write some of the best songs’. “A few years later, I am walking all over the world hearing my song.” Now in his early fifties, Ashcroft is much more sanguine than he was – and he is ready to pass on the wisdom of his years. And in his sights, thanks in part to his son’s musical tastes and what he’s heard at home, is what he sees as the problems in today’s music. “The youth have such easy access to a plethora of stuff, but they are very discerning now,” he says. “My son loves Lana Del Rey [and] there’s a certain aesthetic and style and a quality with that, but they’re looking for other things after all the plastic stuff. “In reality, we’re still human and we still want the good stuff. “We still want quality, we still want the stuff that moves us.” There’s no doubt that Ashcroft, with two Ivor Novello Awards for Songwriter of the Year and Outstanding Contribution to British Music, has the ability to provide what he believes is needed. And he says he is determined to do so, as a way of repaying what he received as a teenager growing up in the shadow of Manchester’s vibrant music scene in the 1980s. ""The Smiths… Happy Mondays… these people were all relatively local,” he says. “They were not from America, and I thought ‘these people are from Manc, I can get a bus to there’ and that had quite a profound effect.” He says that despite being “banned from doing music at GCSE because I was naughty on the xylophone”, that wider musical schooling the region gave him spurred him to success. ""I won the lottery in the sense of when I got into music as I could go and see these people,” he says. “It was such a beautiful education."" ""It is important when you see people from the streets you live in, and it was the same for me watching the Stone Roses back in the day. “You think ‘oh wow, maybe I could to this’.” He says passing on that spirit to a new generation of bands is vitally important to him in order to give them the confidence to follow in his footsteps, as he did with his heroes back in the early 1990s. ""When you first tell people you’re going to be in a band or creative, you get mocked a little bit, because you might not be amongst anyone who’s ever done it before,"" he says. ""But you have to be a pioneer [and] you also have to take control over your life and your destiny."" He says a major step in his efforts to inspire will be two shows at Wigan Warriors’ Robin Park, which have been titled simply as “The Homecoming”. For Ashcroft, it will be a chance to relive memories of one of his favourite gigs with his former band. In May 1998, more than 30,000 fans thronged on to Wigan’s Haigh Hall estate to witness what Ashcroft calls, in a nod to the “mythical” landmark show by Stone Roses eight years earlier, ""my own version of Spike Island"". ""It was a very celebratory day for the fans and the people and the locals,” he says. “I was born in Billinge Hospital and when I stepped on to the stage, I turned around and I could actually see it in the distance.” He says such was the effect of the show, which came at the height of The Verve’s fame in the months after Urban Hymns was released, that years later, “lads in the pub were like ‘if you see Rich, tell him nice one, because it just gave a sense of pride on that for the town’”. “A lot of stories came from the Haigh Hall gig and it influenced a lot of people and inspired them a bit.” And it is that sense of pride he aims to bring back with his shows in July and hopes will roll into an annual series or festival that could boost Wigan’s economy and give local bands a platform. “I am hoping that these gigs and potentially next year… could be something that the town puts on more often and can inspire the youth to form their own bands and do their own music,” he says. And it is not just local musicians he wants to inspire. ""If we can prove that this can work, then I think Wigan is a great place for people from all over the North West to get to,” he says. ""It could be something that we could look back on and go ‘yeah, that’s where it started, that’s when Wigan, for the first time in years, became a focal point for music’."" That said he admits that the shows are not just about inspiration – they are also a celebration of his much-loved back catalogue. “The Verve haven’t played or been together for years,” he says. “It is an opportunity to see and hear those songs by the people who originally sung them. “There’s been several attempts in that 25 years to play again in Wigan, but it’s not been logistically possible. “So let’s get it on, let’s get it done.” Richard Ashcroft: The Homecoming is at Robin Park in Wigan on 20 and 21 July.

178,Sweden prepares for Eurovision with heightened security,"Security is being tightened for the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden's third city Malmo, with large demonstrations planned to coincide with the event and the country already on high alert. Police and organisers say they're well-prepared and hoping for a ""joyful"" event. The annual feel-good celebration of pop and showbiz is this year shrouded by complaints from some quarters over Israel's participation amid the war in Gaza. Sweden was already facing heightened security challenges, and Malmo is expecting one of the country's biggest ever policing efforts. As many as 100,000 visitors are set to descend on this city on Sweden's south-west coast for the world's largest live music contest. Colourful Eurovision banners decorate many of the city's streets, and it's the third time that Malmo is playing host, after Swedish artist Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, with her hit song Tattoo. A programme of festivities kicks off on Saturday, with semi-finals next Tuesday and Thursday, culminating in the grand final on 11 May. An estimated 200 million viewers worldwide are expected to tune in for the four-hour spectacle. Forces have been drafted in from across Sweden, with reinforcements from neighbouring Denmark and Norway. Swedish police are usually armed, but some officers will carry larger weapons as a precautionary measure. Malmo police chief Petra Stenkula said the whole country was already ""on a terror level of four out of five"". ""I think it's obvious that the world's insecurity has also affected Eurovision,"" she told the BBC. ""In Sweden, and Malmo in particular, there have been protests against Israel taking part in the competition."" The police chief said there were no specific threats to the event, but the alert level was raised last August, following a spate of Quran-burnings that angered the Muslim world. An internal police report, highlighted by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT , described Sweden as a ""priority target"" for violent jihadist groups. The 23-page threat assessment for Eurovision also cited unrest, cyber attacks and disruption of the broadcast as other potential risks. ""In Sweden, police are used to working with very complex issues, and we think we have good planning,"" said Petra Stenkula. Cameras have also been set up and drones are being used for surveillance. Guests will also have to pass through airport-style security controls including scanners and searches, when entering venues and no bags are allowed. ""It's a huge thing for the city of Malmo. So, of course, it's important that everything works smoothly,"" said Per-Erik Ebbestahl, Malmo's security director. ""We feel very well prepared."" Authorities have been planning for months and also working with their counterparts in Liverpool, which hosted last year's competition. ""It's been very, very, helpful for us,"" he told the BBC. Malmo has hosted the Pope and also a Holocaust Remembrance conference two years ago. But the city's security director says what is new is the general threat towards Sweden and large gatherings. ""It's not aimed at Eurovision per se,"" he said, pointing out that similar security had been in place for recent ice hockey playoffs, and was also planned for this month's Taylor Swift concerts in Stockholm. Fencing had been erected and additional cameras were being mounted when the BBC visited the Malmo Arena on Thursday. Inside the venue, rehearsals were already under way for a show featuring 37 acts. ""We have really exciting shows coming up,"" said Ebba Adielsson, SVT's executive Eurovision producer. ""We know the debate out there, we know about the demonstrations and we are well prepared. We hear it and we respect it,"" she said. ""But I sincerely hope that it doesn't overshadow it that much. Israeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, and her song Hurricane will undoubtedly be in the spotlight. Originally titled October Rain, the song had alluded to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel last 7 October. Israel's public broadcaster agreed to modify the lyrics, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is responsible for the contest, gave the song the green light. About 1,200 people were killed in Israel and 253 others taken hostage during the Hamas attacks. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then by Israeli's military offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Commentators have suggested that it is one of the most politically-charged Eurovisions ever. Earlier this year, 1,000 Swedish musicians signed an open letter urging Israel's exclusion. Artists have also been targeted by criticism, and in a statement last month the EBU said: ""We firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists."" Speaking to international reporters, this week Denmark's entrant SABA said she'd been under huge pressure: ""I've received a lot of messages and people can be very personal... even on the street."" Israel's National Security Council on Thursday issued an advisory warning against travelling to Malmo. With a population of 360,000, it is one of Sweden's most diverse cities. Some of Malmo's 1,200-strong Jewish community have said they feel nervous and apprehensive. Malmo also has a sizeable Palestinian community, and the contest has provoked strong feelings and weekly protests for months demanding that Eurovision boycott Israel. In the busy Triangeln area, Yomn Kadoura, one of the rally organisers and a Palestinian resident, told the BBC: ""Israel is not welcome to Malmo because they are bombing civilian people in Gaza."" Kadoura points out that Russia was banned after it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ""We cannot accept or normalise the genocide,"" she said: an accusation that Israel vehemently rejects. Police told the BBC that 10 separate applications had been lodged for demonstrations in the coming week. Two mass rallies in central Malmo, several kilometres away from the venue, will take place on Thursday and next Saturday, coinciding with the second semi-final and final. Other protests will be ""nearby"" but not in front of the arena. An alternative music performance is also being staged. Police expect the demonstration to be larger than the protests seen so far. ""Some weekends we have had up to 20,000 people,"" said police chief Petra Stenkula. ""We're hoping that even if we gave a large number of protesters, they're going to follow the rules,"" says Per-Erik Ebbestahl, adding that previous protests have been well-organised and issue-free. Among other demonstrations is a planned burning of a Quran, which police are yet to decide on. There is no law in Sweden that prohibits desecrating religious texts, but such acts have often provoked tension. ""It's something we work with all the time, but there have been some hard feelings before about these things in Malmo,"" said the city's police chief. But despite the tension offstage, Eurovision will always remain Eurovision, with a raft of events including a special ABBA exhibition celebrating 50 years since the Swedish quartet stole the show with Waterloo. ""I really hope it's going to be a fantastic, joyful week here in Malmo,"" said Ebba Adielsson of Swedish TV. ""Because there's so much love and passion for the Eurovision Song Contest.""",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68950907,entertainment
179,Why North Korea's latest propaganda bop is a huge TikTok hit,"When North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un released his latest song two weeks ago, surely he couldn’t have foreseen it becoming a hit on TikTok. But the propaganda tune has gone viral online with Gen Z users bopping around to the synthy-electro pop. Most are clearly quite oblivious to the Korean lyrics praising a man who’s vowed to “thoroughly annihilate the US” and launched dozens of ballistic missiles. “Let’s sing Kim Jong Un, the great leader/ Let’s brag about Kim Jong Un, our friendly father,” the song goes. It’s just a really great tune, TikTokkers say. “Taylor Swift was not expecting to get blown out of the water right after dropping her new album,” one fan joked online. “Wait, this slaps”, “This song needs a Grammy”, “It’s so dystopian in the catchiest way” – they are just some of the enthused comments under TikTok videos. But the sunny pop hides something more sinister, experts say. Friendly Father is just the latest in a line of propaganda pop songs churned out by the Communist state in the past 50 years. It’s peppy, bright-tempoed and dangerously catchy – not that much different from Western pop hits. But there is a certain Soviet-era tinge to it; Gen Z users describe it as “Abba-coded”, a reference to the Swedish superband. “In this case, the song has Abba written all over it,“ says Peter Moody, a North Korea analyst at Korea University. “It's upbeat, it could not be more catchy, and a rich set of orchestral-sounding sequences could not be more prominent,” he says. But there’s more than just commercial considerations at play when writing a chart-topper in North Korea - authorities want an earworm that penetrates minds. There’s no space for abstract phrasing or timing that’s overly complicated , says Alexandra Leonzini, a Cambridge University scholar who researches North Korean music. Melodies have to be simple, accessible, something people can easily pick up. Tunes also need to be pitched at a vocal range where they can be sung by most people. The masses can’t keep up with vocal gymnastics, so forget about multi-octave riffs. Ms Leonzini says the songbook also rarely contains any tracks with real emotion. ""The idea is they want to motivate, to strive towards a common goal for the benefit of the nation… they don't tend to produce songs like ballads,” she says. There is zero tolerance for creative or artistic freedom in North Korea. It is illegal for musicians, painters and writers to produce works simply for the sake of art. “All artistic output in North Korea must serve the class education of citizens and more specifically educate them as to why they should feel a sense of gratitude, a sense of loyalty to the party,” Ms Leonzini says. North Korea’s government believes in the ""seed theory"", she adds, where every single work must contain an ideological seed, a message that is then disseminated en masse through art. Music is one of its most powerful tools - and Pyongyang keeps its pop tracks for those at home. The state has paraded its opera troupes and symphony orchestras on overseas missions – but its lighter ensembles are kept for a domestic audience only. North Koreans wake up every morning to propaganda songs blasted over village town squares, say defectors. The song sheet and lyrics of the latest songs - which only come out sparingly - are printed in newspapers and magazines; usually they also have to learn dances to go with it, says Keith Howard, an emeritus professor of musicology at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, who first visited North Korea in the 1990s. “By the time the song has sort of been taken into the body, it’s become part of the person,” he says. “So they know the lyrics so well, even if they're just doing the actions, even if they're just listening to it. A good ideological song does that - it needs to embed the message.” And for regime watchers, the two-minute track released last month has an alarming new message. While Western music fans have been dissecting Taylor Swift's new songs or breaking down the Kendrick Lamar v Drake diss tracks, North Korean experts have been scrutinising Friendly Father’s lyrics. It’s not the first song dedicated to Mr Kim. But there’s a noticeable departure in the language and vocabulary used. He is being referred to as “father” and “the Great” - terms previously reserved for North Korea’s first leader, his grandfather Kim Il Sung. Mr Kim was called the ""Great Successor” when he took over the mantle in 2012 after his father Kim Jong Il’s passing. However, more than a decade on, analysts think this may be a sign that he is shoring up his image as North Korea's ""Supreme Leader"". In recent times, he’s also replaced the lyrics in another propaganda song, switching out “our father Kim Il Sung” to “our father Kim Jong Un”. It could be a sign of his direction. As a leader he has become increasingly hostile and aggressive in his rhetoric, pledging to build up his country’s military arsenal. At the start of this year, he also declared the North would no longer seek reunification with the South, which he said was ""public enemy number one"". Reports say Pyongyang also demolished a major arch that symbolised hope for reunification with the South - an arch that had also been symbolic of his grandfather’s legacy. “Songs are used to telegraph the direction the state is going in… to signpost important moments and important developments in politics,” Ms Leonzini says. “A song is almost like the newspaper in North Korea.” Meanwhile on TikTok, users are just enjoying the music. Some say they can’t stop listening to the song: on the way to work, at the gym, while doing homework. Others are nostalgic, it reminds them of older Spanish and French pop or Eastern European styles, they say. Existing North Korean music fans recommend the other big hits – there are only four or five state-endorsed North Korean bands, of which the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble and the all-girl Moranbong Band are most cited. “North Korea has a song called Potato Pride which is a song on how versatile and useful a potato is, if anyone’s interested,” one TikTokker suggests. For many American users, the irony’s not been lost on them that a Communist song has gone viral on the Chinese-owned app while US lawmakers are trying to ban it. It’s an idiosyncrasy that’s caught mass appeal. British TikTokker Matas Kardokas made several meme videos using North Korean propaganda songs – one says: “Nobody in the trendy coffee shop knows that I am listening to North Korean propaganda music right now"". It gained more than 400,000 likes. “Something in me just clicked and I was like, ‘Hey, I’m sitting in a coffee shop right now listening to this',” he told the BBC. ""Isn’t that just the most bonkers thing you could imagine?” Additional reporting by Rachel Looker in Washington DC",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckv7yk88q0go,entertainment
180,The Fall Guy stars: 'I'd love to see stunts get an Oscar',"Ever felt your contribution at work goes unnoticed? Try being a stunt actor. They're some of the unsung heroes of the film industry, regularly risking their bodies and even their lives to thrill audiences. And when it all goes according to plan, you're not supposed to notice them. ""The better they are at their job, the more they disappear,"" Ryan Gosling told the BBC earlier this week. The Canadian actor plays title character Colt Seavers in new blockbuster The Fall Guy - the story of a stuntman who gets seriously hurt on a film set. With some exceptions such as Tom Cruise, who famously insists on doing almost all his own stunts, doubles usually take the place of A-list stars in the most nail-biting scenes. And The Fall Guy was no exception. So both Ryan and and co-star Emily Blunt said they'd back calls for stunt performers to have their own category at the Oscars. ""They dress like us, they do the dangerous things for us. They take the hits for us, they put themselves in harm's way for us,"" said Ryan. Currently there's no Academy Award dedicated to stunts but other bodies such as The Screen Actors Guild do celebrate them. Up-and-coming stunt actors have been telling BBC Newsbeat it's about time they got more recognition for their work on set, and the effort it takes to even get there. To become a professional it helps to be signed on the British Stunt Register, which told Newsbeat there are 470 registered stunt performers working in the UK. Getting on to the books means mastering six disciplines, and for Catriona Scott those are scuba diving, horse riding, trampolining, taekwondo, rock climbing and stunt driving. That doesn't happen overnight, and the 30-year-old from Edinburgh has been training for seven years. ""I studied at Glasgow University and I did a year abroad in America,"" she tells Newsbeat, after arriving on a motorcycle in true stuntwoman style. ""While I was there, I did a three-month internship in LA and I met two stunt performers. It was like, 'Oh, that's a job?!' ""As soon as I realised that was something that you could actually do as a job, it was like, 'that's what I want to do'."" She was inspired by films including Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter growing up, and her dream once she qualifies is to perform in a major film franchise. Two stunt actors who know a thing or two about putting themselves in harm's way are Jules Wallace, from Glasgow, and Ayesha Hussein, from London. Jules got into stunts after training in martial arts and has performed in fight scenes for productions including Enola Holmes and The Last Duel. Ayesha, meanwhile, got scouted while working as a knife thrower and will soon appear in Deadpool 3. Like Catriona, they're both training for the BSR to take their careers to the next level. ""Stunt performers put in a lot of time and effort to get to where they are,"" says Jules. ""And they literally risk their lives on the job."" ""It really is one of those jobs that you go to work and you could have the most safe, incredible team, but you still don't have 100% guarantee that you're not going to go home severely injured, or worse,"" adds Alyshea. That was what happened to David Holmes - Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double in the Harry Potter series. In January 2009 he broke his neck rehearsing a stunt for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and sustained a spinal injury that left him paralysed. Alyshea says it's important for the industry to give greater visibility to stunt performers so audiences appreciate the work that goes into great stunts as well as inspire the next generation of talent. ""We deserve a bit more now,"" she says. ""There are so many gifted young people who would be an absolutely tremendous stunt performers but they just have no idea that it exists as a career."" Jules says it's ""good that people are taking the time to give them a little bit of recognition"" because there's not much out there. ""It would be wonderful to see stunts getting an Oscar,"" says Catriona. ""We are the reason why so many movies are so incredible,"" adds Alyshea. ""And literally every other department seems to have an Oscar category except us and we're the ones arguably taking the highest risk."" Newsbeat has asked the Oscars whether they might consider an award for stuntmen and women but has not had a response. Joining the BSR will give you access to film and TV productions looking for stunt performers, but it's not easy to get on the list. The six disciplines you need to master must cover different skills including strength, vehicles, fighting and falling. Once an expert has tested you in these areas, a panel from the BSR will examine your training history before signing you off. Even then, you'll only be a probationary member and will continue to be graded until you reach the level of a stunt co-ordinator. The BSR told Newsbeat it was ""fantastic"" to see The Fall Guy ""shine such light on the stunt community and the exceptional work they do"". Nicholas Daines, a BSR coordinator whose stunt credits include Batman, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter, says as well as recognition at awards, it's also important that stunt performers are better compensated for the work they do. ""Shining a spotlight is all very well, but it's such a physical profession, you might not be able to do it for forever, and some people don't even make it home, or they have career-ending injuries. ""So our financial situation and wages should should be in alignment with that."" He also hopes a greater awareness of stunt work will encourage more people to consider it as a career. ""It's great that all this is highlighted to make youngsters realise that you can make a living from being physical and not necessarily have to go down the academic route,"" he says. ""The recognition from these actors in this film on such a creative profession is wonderful. ""You're sending the right message to youngsters that this is something that they could do.""

181,Riverside music festival cancelled over increased costs,"An electronic music festival has been cancelled due to low ticket sales and rising costs. Organisers of the Riverside Festival said they were unable to host the event at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow over the 25-26 May bank holiday weekend. A statement on social media said they had taken the ""extremely difficult decision"" to cancel, but promised music fans they were preparing for ""two huge shows"" later in the year. They added full refunds would be available from ticket holders' point of purchase. The festival, which attracts some of the fastest-rising electronic music talent from across the UK and Europe, celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. It was due to be headlined this year by West Lothian duo LF System and American DJ Green Velvet. But its organisers said increasing costs combined with a heavy calendar for dance music events meant it was no longer viable to host the festival this year. They said: ""It is with deep regret and heavy hearts that we’ve taken the extremely difficult decision to cancel this year’s Riverside Festival. More news from Glasgow and west Scotland ""With lower-than-expected sales and increased infrastructure, staff, transport, and artist costs, all in an over-saturated event landscape, we could not deliver the festival to our usual high standards. ""We understand how upsetting this is for those of you who have bought tickets, and we sincerely thank you all for your continued support."" The organisers said they was planning for shows to be held at the same venue on 31 August and 1 September, but the line-ups are yet to be confirmed. Ticket holders have been told to expect refunds within five working days.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6py7l067p2o,entertainment
182,Joanna Lumley to announce UK Eurovision scores,"Dame Joanna Lumley will front the UK's jury at next week's Eurovision Song Contest, the BBC has revealed. It means that the star of Absolutely Fabulous and Fool Me Once will reveal the jury's scores during the competition's grand final in Malmo, Sweden. ""I am delighted to be announcing the jury vote for the UK at this year's Eurovision,"" said the actress in a statement. ""It's such a fabulous honour to give the iconic 'douze points'!"" The news was revealed by Eurovision commentator Graham Norton during Friday's episode of The One Show. He joked that Dame Joanna might read out the results as Patsy - her outrageously boozy character from the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. ""Glassful of champagne, fistful of cigarettes. Yeah, do it,"" he laughed. Dame Joanna follows in the footsteps of comedian Catherine Tate, who fronted the jury last year, as well as previous alumni Nigella Lawson, Mel Giedroyc, Richard Osman and Cheryl Baker. Each country's jury is populated by five music professionals, who judge the finalists on their music and lyrics, assigning points to their 10 favourite acts. Last year, the UK panel gave the maximum 12 points to the eventual winner, Swedish singer Loreen. A separate televote also saw the UK public award Loreen five points. Dame Joanna started her career as a model in the 1960s before transitioning into acting. She was a Bond girl in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and later had a brief but memorable role as Elaine Perkins in Coronation Street. Her first major part was in the TV action series The New Avengers, where she played the British intelligence agent Purdy. She won a Bafta for her role as the outrageously boozy former model Patsy in the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, and was nominated for a Tony Award after appearing in the Broadway revival of La Bête in 2011. Ten years later, she was made a Dame in the Queen's New Year Honours list for her services to drama, entertainment and charity. She will deliver the UK's Eurovision scores in a year when controversy over Israel's participation has overshadowed the contest. Musicians and politicians in several countries called for the country to be suspended while the Israel-Gaza war continues. Organisers have resisted calls for the country to be suspended, saying the show ""is not a contest between governments"". However, Israel was forced to change the lyrics of its song October Rain, after officials decided the original was too political. The first version was widely considered to be a reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, with some lyrics paying tribute to the victims. It has now been rewritten under the revised title Hurricane. Several pro-Palestinian protests are planned for Malmo next week in the run-up to the contest, and the Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli contestant Eden Golan had arrived at the contest with ""three times"" the usual number of security guards.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n1j83p92ko,entertainment
183,Olivia Rodrigo fans make 'best of a bad situation',"Nursing drinks in a bar in Manchester, fans of Olivia Rodrigo found a fun way to escape the chaos of the Co-op Live arena's stop-start schedule. Left disappointed after the troubled venue postponed the US's singer's shows , many decided to join a Rodrigo-themed evening specially arranged for ticket holders. ""We're making the best of a bad situation,"" one fan said. Mia Tunney, 23, added: ""It's made us feel a bit better to come here and have a dance."" Mia and friend Emilia Boylan, both from Manchester, both booked the day off for Rodrigo's show after getting the tickets last year. Instead of watching one of their favourite acts, ""we’ve randomly booked to go and see the Wizard of Oz,"" Emilia said. The 22-year-old has already fallen foul of Co-op Live's chaotic opening, having seen her tickets for Peter Kay's appearance affected. ""We were both upset so we just thought let’s go out and make the most of it,"" Mia said, adding she thought the Olivia Rodrigo-themed party at Manchester's Gorilla bar was a ""dead good"" idea. It is one of a number of places in the city offering an alternative for ticket-holders looking for new plans. Aziya and Naoimi from Northern Ireland decided to fly to Manchester yesterday despite learning they would not be able to watch their favourite star days ago. ""I was so excited, I wanted to cry to her sad songs, not cry because I can’t see her perform them,"" Aziya said. ""It's so annoying,"" said Naoimi. The sentiment was echoed by Rodrigo herself, as the US singer-songwriter said she was ""sooooo disappointed"" when her weekend shows fell victim to the ""technical issues"" dogging the opening of Co-op Live. What are your rights if a concert gets postponed? Olivia Rodrigo's Manchester tour dates fall foul of Co-op Live arena fiasco I spent £1,500 on trip to see Olivia Rodrigo at Co-op Live Becky Mahon, from Partington, said she decided to catch up with friend Amber Uttamlal at the Gorilla party to have their ""own little Olivia Rodrigo day anyway"". ""I am quite gutted to be honest, but I am glad that we got to celebrate in a different way, just hanging out in Manchester today and getting friendship bracelets,"" Amber said. The show was supposed to be a pre-GCSE celebration for 15-year-old Summer from Burnley, whose family bought her a ticket as a Christmas present. ""It was my dream to watch her,"" the teenager said. ""I love that she started off in musical theatre and that she’s just grown in confidence, because I do musical theatre so I feel like I’ve got a bond with her."" Mum Lyndsey said the family had ""everything crossed"" in the hope the shows would be rescheduled to a date they could all go.

184,Victorian theatre to reopen after 8-year renovation,"A Victorian-era theatre in Lincolnshire is reopening after eight years of restoration. The Kings Entertainment Theatre, in Gainsborough, was in a state of disrepair when it was bought by local businessman Lee Fox in 2016. Mr Fox said he has spent years renovating the building himself on a “shoestring budget” to reduce costs. The theatre will open again on Friday 5 May. Mr Fox, who runs a sand and aggregate business in Scunthorpe, bought the venue following an intervention by the town's mayor, Richard Craig, after discovering the building's 'at risk' status, to prevent the theatre being auctioned. Over the course of the renovation, Mr Fox has installed new electrics, new bathroom facilities and a new bar. “I didn't realise how much work was involved when I took over the building,” Mr Fox said. “Every surface had to be renovated."" Mr Fox has said his main aim was to ensure the lengthy renovation was cost effective, so he scoured the country for items he could repurpose. “Our toilets came from a NatWest bank in Leeds and our dance floor is from a school in Hemel Hempstead,” he said. ""I want this to be somewhere people can come to have a good time,"" he added. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

185,Ewan McVicar brings Pavilion Festival back to Ayr,"From working in a warehouse to selling out concerts across the world, Ewan McVicar has seen his dreams come true in a way he never expected. The Ayrshire DJ found global success in 2021 when his version of Rufus and Chaka Khan's 1974 hit, Tell Me Something Good, spent 13 weeks in the Top 40. For the second year, 30-year-old McVicar will host the successful Pavilion Festival in his hometown. Over 7,000 fans will gather each day on Ayr's Esplanade to see McVicar perform alongside acts like Patrick Topping, David Morales and Heather Small. McVicar says that, now in his second year of putting on the festival, he is starting to feel more relaxed and appreciate the event. ""I am taking more in, taking more feedback from people. Year two, how do we keep the buzz up? ""I came up with the slogan 'For the people, for the music'. I wanted people to understand the wider focus. ""We are not here to make money. We are not here to be the biggest festival in the world. ""But if we can deliver an experience people want in Ayr, that's what it's all about."" Despite no longer living in the town, McVicar is a champion for Ayr, even naming his EP Heather Park after the Kincaidston street where he grew up. Ahead of the 2023 Pavilion Festival, he said it was the music scene in Ayr in the 80s and 90s that influenced his style. He was influenced by STREETrave, who were behind infamous club nights in Ayr. Last year's festival saw the promoters perform in Ayr for the first time in 30 years. They will play this year's festival, celebrating their 35th anniversary. Pavilion festival at Ayr's Low Green will have four stages, a 'rave cave' and a 33m (108ft) observation wheel. McVicar said it's ""a bit surreal still"" that he has managed to bring the event to life. He said: ""I am 30 and I've been thinking of this since I was 16. ""I walked down here at the Low Green as a wee guy - the site is beautiful. ""As I've travelled, the one thing I miss is the beach and the sea, so coming back down here is the dream and it's going to come true every year."" South Ayrshire council leader, Cllr Martin Dowie said Pavilion Festival is the ""start of our year"", alongside events like the Scottish Grand National, the Gold Cup and International Ayr Show. ""This is an anchor event for us,"" said Cllr Dowie. ""It's very important, it puts us back on the map. ""The economic impact for Ayr and South Ayrshire is massive and all credit to the boys for coming here and picking Ayr, we're delighted to host.""

186,Nine of the best TV shows to watch this May,"From Tudor detective show Shardlake to the return of Bridgerton and Doctor Who, and Benedict Cumberbatch starring alongside a puppet in Netflix thriller series Eric. 1. Shardlake The best new television detective lives in the 16th Century and grapples with the life-threatening politics of the court of Henry VIII. And the show arrives just days after the death of CJ Sansom , whose popular series of Shardlake novels inspired it. Arthur Hughes stars as Matthew Shardlake, a lawyer working for the King's right-hand man, Thomas Cromwell (Sean Bean), the historical figure now famous from Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall. Cromwell dispatches Shardlake to find who murdered the emissary he sent to shut down a monastery, in a drama full of period atmosphere. Shardlake is the smartest guy in the court, but is taunted by his enemies as ""crookback"" because he has scoliosis. Hughes (who has a different disability, radial dysplasia) won praise in 2022 as that other so-called crookback, Richard III, being the first actor with a disability to play the part for the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company. Anthony Boyle ( Masters of the Air ) plays Jack Barak, sent by Cromwell to keep an eye on Shardlake. Sansom wrote seven novels about the Tudor-era detective, which promises a potentially long run. Shardlake premieres 1 May on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK 2. The Tattooist of Auschwitz This series got a boost recently when it was announced that Barbra Streisand had recorded an appropriately named new song, Love Will Survive, to play over the end titles. Based on Heather Morris' novel of the same name, the drama tells the real-life story of Lali and Gita Sokolov, who met in 1942 when both were sent to Auschwitz, where Lali was forced to tattoo identification numbers on the arms of other Jews in the camp. Jonah Hauer-King (Prince Eric in the live-action Little Mermaid) plays Lali as a young man, and Anna Prochniak (Baptiste) plays Gita. Harvey Keitel plays the widowed Lali decades later, when we see him tell his story to Morris (Melanie Lynskey). Streisand posted on social media that she recorded the song in memory of the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust, ""and also to say that even in the darkest times, the power of love can triumph and endure"". The Tattooist of Auschwitz premieres 2 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK 3. A Man in Full Tom Wolfe specialised in dissecting how money and ego function in society, themes that flow through this series based on his 1998 novel. Jeff Daniels, with a full-blown Southern accent, plays Charlie Croker, a real estate baron in Atlanta, Georgia, a powerful bullying type who has felt invincible but is now facing bankruptcy. His rivals are ready to pounce. Diane Lane plays his ex-wife, Lucy Liu is a business associate and William Jackson Harper the mayor of Atlanta, running for re-election in a racially tense atmosphere. The series was written by David E Kelley (Big Little Lies) who has a knack for just this kind of soapy, sprawling, well-cast show. The actress and director Regina King (One Night in Miami) stays behind the camera, directing three episodes, and Thomas Schlamme (The West Wing) handles the other three. If the trailer 's scene of Daniels threatening a live snake with his clenched fist is any indication, the show has kept at least some of Wolfe's satirical edge. A Man in Full premieres 2 May on Netflix internationally 4. Dark Matter Joel Edgerton outsmarts himself in this sci-fi suspense series as Jason Dessen, a Chicago physics professor who brilliantly invents a box that allows him to enter parallel worlds where there are alternate versions of him. When he is kidnapped into a strange other world and wants to come home to his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and son, his parallel self is determined to stop him. Blake Crouch, who created the show based on his 2016 novel, told Vanity Fair , ""There are real, concrete, scientific concepts being presented, and I always wanted those to feel true"". Fortunately, he has Edgerton to ground the mind-bending story about an ordinary man second-guessing his life choices. ""We'll throw a bit of word soup at you of science,"" Edgerton said, then it's up to the audience to ""agree to agree to it"" as a drama about paths not taken. Of course, most of us have never been forcibly taken to a parallel world and wondered, as Jason does, ""What if the person who abducted me is me?"" Dark Matter premieres 8 May on Apple TV+ internationally 5. Bodkin The first fictional series from Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, Higher Ground, is a send-up of true-crime podcasts. Netflix describes it as a ""darkly comedic thriller"" but from the trailer it also seems goofy-funny, with Will Forte as Gilbert, a podcaster from the US who travels to Ireland to explore the disappearance of three men more than two decades before. Along with a tough-minded investigative journalist named Dove (Siobhan Cullen), who is consulting on the podcast, and his researcher, Emmy (Robyn Carr), he travels to the picturesque coastal town of Bodkin, where the locals want them to mind their own business. Forte, who played plenty of wide-eyed, hapless characters during his time on Saturday Night Live, gives Gilbert endless enthusiasm. He arrives in Bodkin eager to trace his Irish roots and ready to be enraptured by the least little thing. ""There's an island of nuns teaching yoga!"" he cries. ""It just keeps getting better!"" The poor innocent has apparently never seen one of Martin McDonagh's acerbic portrayals of Ireland, but Gilbert has his own winning charm. Bodkin premieres 9 May on Netflix internationally 6. Doctor Who After a brief appearance on a 60th Anniversary episode with David Tennant's Doctor, his own Christmas special, and a galaxy worth of publicity, Ncuti Gatwa's 15th Doctor is here for real, along with his sidekick, Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson). Returning showrunner Russell T Davies, who first rebooted the BBC sci-fi show in 2005, promises the new series will take advantage of a bigger budget – the result of it now being a co-production with Disney – as the Doctor and Ruby zip around time, from Regency England into the future. ""Finally we can afford for different members of an alien race to have different faces,"" he told EW , also hinting at a bond between the two main characters without revealing too much. Both the Doctor and Ruby were foundlings as infants – he turned up from another universe and she was left on a church doorstep – and now they are curious about their origins. ""That story is going to be the spine of the whole show,"" Davies has said. Doctor Who premieres 10 May on Disney+ in the US and 11 May on BBC1 and BBC iPlayer in the UK 7. Bridgerton Bridgerton fans have known for some time that Lady Whistledown, author of the tell-all scandal sheet revealing the secrets and lies of Regency high society, is Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan, also known for Derry Girls). Season 3 focuses on the gossip-monger herself and her slow-burning romance with her good friend Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), whom she overheard at the end of season 2 saying he would never consider her as a wife. But as the love affair of Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley) demonstrated last season, such declarations mean nothing in Bridgerton world. Bailey and Ashley return for this series as the newly married Viscount and Viscountess, along with Julie Andrews as the voice of Lady Whistledown and much of the original cast. The season will be divided in two, with four episodes coming in May and four more in June, with a fourth season in the works and plenty of other Bridgertons to marry off. Bridgerton premieres 16 May on Netflix internationally 8. The Big Cigar Andre Holland stars as Huey P Newton in an outlandish story based on one of the lesser-known, least probable episodes in the life of the Black Panther Party's founder. Sought by the FBI in 1974, Newton fled the US with the help of Bert Schneider (Alessandro Nivola), the politically active Hollywood producer of films including Easy Rider and the anti-war documentary Hearts and Minds. Schneider's scheme, according to the series: smuggle Newton to Cuba in the guise of working on a movie, totally fake, called The Cigar. The show is based on a magazine article by Joshuah Bearman, whose other article about a bogus movie became the 2012 Oscar-winning film Argo. The large cast includes Tiffany Boone as Newton's girlfriend and Glynn Turman as his father. The first two episodes of six were directed by Don Cheadle, in a brash, kinetic style that captures the period. The Big Cigar premieres 17 May on Apple TV+ 9. Eric For a series with a high-profile star, Benedict Cumberbatch, and creator, Abi Morgan, Eric is oddly under the radar. Cumberbatch stars as Vincent, a puppeteer on a television show called Good Day Sunshine, whose young son disappears, leaving behind a drawing of a monstrous blue creature. As Vincent begins to unravel, he creates a puppet called Eric and believes that if he gets Eric on television his son will return. Morgan (whose engaging series include The Hour and The Split) set this idiosyncratic emotional thriller in the gritty New York of the 1980's. ""Eric is a dark and crazy journey into the heart of 1980s New York – and the good, bad and ugly world of Vincent,"" she has said . Cumberbatch has taken a broader view, saying of the show, “It is rooted in a lot of real-world issues, looking at parenthood, looking at marriage, looking at mental health, looking at the Aids pandemic, but also the ongoing crises of homophobia, of racism in institutions.” Eric premieres 30 May on Netflix internationally -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

187,"Gavin and Stacey is returning for final episode, says James Corden","James Corden has ended speculation about new Gavin and Stacey material by announcing a final episode of the show will air on Christmas Day. Writing on Instagram , the former talk show host said: ""It's official! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey"". He added: ""See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James"". It confirms the episode has been written with co-creator Ruth Jones, who has shared an on-screen relationship with Corden in the show. A report from Deadline in February said a new episode would involve most members of the original cast. This includes Matthew Horne and Joanna Page as Essex boy Gavin and his Welsh partner Stacey. Other cast members who look set to appear include Rob Brydon, who plays Stacey's uncle Bryn, and Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb, who play Gavin's parents Pamela and Mick. The last time we saw these characters was back in 2019, during another Christmas special. The episode, which was the first for nine years, ended on a cliff-hanger after Nessa (Ruth Jones) proposed to Smithy (James Corden). Viewers will be hoping to find out what has happened between Nessa and Smithy, but also to see how their on-screen son, ""Neil the Baby"", Noel Edmond Smith, is doing. The final episode of Gavin and Stacey could be a bittersweet moment for fans - the 2019 Christmas special was the most watched show in a decade, bringing in more than 17 million viewers .

It also won a Must-See Moment Bafta in 2020 , voted for by the public, for the moment when Nessa proposed.

188,"'If the show must go on, phones must go off'","A classical tenor who stopped mid-concert after becoming distracted by the audience filming has said the spell of performances is being broken by phones. Ian Bostridge said seeing phones being held up towards him as he sang had interrupted and distracted his performance with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO). The orchestra has recently come under fire by performers for altering its rules, allowing the audience to take photos and snippets of film during concerts. CBSO stated that photography had been allowed at concerts for a number of years, giving audiences the chance to share their experiences. Mr Bostridge said he was not aware of the policy when he stopped the concert and added his actions were not intended to make ""a protest of any sort"". But since learning about the new rules, he said he hoped that the CBSO would change its mind. In the orchestra's vision statement, it states that any ""perceived 'rules' of a traditional concert"" are removed, with audiences also invited to clap whenever they like. ""We are doing these things because we believe that the best music in the world should be for everyone,"" the vision statement adds. Mr Bostridge said of performance: ""You're doing something that's very difficult and also you're trying to project a lot of emotion through music. ""We do have an issue with attracting new audiences but I don't think this is the way to go."" Ruth Millington, an arts writer from Birmingham, said a phone at a recent CBSO performance left her feeling distracted and not enjoying the concert. ""You're there to have two hours where you can actually put your phone away. ""We're all so addicted to our phones, how great to have somewhere you can put it down for two hours and enjoy and immerse yourself in music."" CBSO requests that people use their phones with a dimmed brightness and without flash during concerts. ""We have clarified our rules around photography and filming following feedback. ""However we remain supportive of audiences being able to use their phones at appropriate moments during our concerts.""

189,Miners' artwork depicts demise of coal pits,"An art gallery exploring the 1980s miners' strike and the demise of the coal pits is opening on Saturday. The Last Cage Down is being held at the Mining Art Gallery in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, from 3 May until 6 October. The exhibition coincides with the 40th anniversary of the miner's strike of 1984. Bob McManners, founder of the Mining Art Gallery, said the art on display was ""second to none"" and was created by artists whose ""very existence"" was being attacked. Work by more than 20 artists will be shown in the gallery, including Barrie Ormsby's Crucified Miner and his watercolour Miners' Strike 1984. Robert Olley's Orgreave after Guernica will also be on display. It depicts a violent confrontation on 18 June 1984 between picketing miners and the police. Mr Olley said he designed the work so that the policeman's eyes follow the viewer around the room. He said the exhibition is ""a great way of recording history because in another 10 or 15 years there will not be any miners alive"". During the strike thousands of miners walked out in protest of plans to shut 20 coal pits, which led to the loss of 20,000 jobs. There were often violent confrontations with police officers. Mr McManners said the artwork produced my miners is often surprising because of they were meant to be ""tough men who didn't show their emotion"". ""When you look at mining art in general, there's an emotive side to it,"" he said. ""What could me more emotive than an attack on their very existence?"" He added that the paintings were rarely made for any other purpose than the ""catharsis or pleasure"" of the artist. ""They weren't meant to be hung on walls or sold at exhibitions,"" he said.

190,Family firm turning unwanted pianos into art,"A family-owned piano business is finding creative ways to make use of discarded instruments by turning them into art. Played and Remade is the brainchild of Jon Kelly, owner of The Piano Shop Bath. He says the Somerset business is asked to scrap between 150 and 300 unwanted pianos a year, each of them destined for rubbish dumps. But the shop, which has previously worked with the band Coldplay on repurposing instruments, is offering the discarded pianos to artists for free so that they can turn them into works of art. “Far too many redundant pianos are now being sent to landfill, dumped, abandoned or even burnt,"" said Mr Kelly. Played and Remade was born out of a desire to be more environmentally friendly and to work with creative people ""who share our vision"", he added. ""Each of the pianos holds a story of the people who have lived with the instrument, often over very many years, and of the instrument’s makers,"" Mr Kelly said. ""Through Played and Remade we can keep the story going and forge a special bond between music and art."" The team at the shop has worked with Coldplay more than once, collaborating with the band on a bespoke piano for their Everyday Life tour, and also making the piano lead singer Chris Martin played at the live-streamed Glastonbury 2021. Mr Kelly said throwing pianos away did a ""disservice"" to the skills involved in making them in the first place and was a ""needless waste"" of materials such as rare woods, cast iron, brass, felt and copper. “Knowing what to do with the steady stream of old unwanted pianos is a major issue for the piano trade and for piano owners,"" he added. ""Responsible disposal is expensive, time-consuming and a tragic waste of manufacturing skills and of a wide range of materials, as well as an environmental burden because of the impact on landfill sites. ""[Played and Remade] enables skilled artists to make something magical and new by giving them free access to materials which would otherwise end up on a scrap heap."" The piano business, established 40 years ago, will be selling the art in its London Road shop and also online.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckv7z33444jo,entertainment
191,The Idea of You: Are fictional boy band August Moon based on One Direction?,"If you look at the fictional pop group in new film The Idea of You, they might remind you of one of the world's biggest boy bands. In fact, they might sound a little familiar too. Fictional band August Moon's lead single is catchy, fun and poppy - and more than slightly reminiscent of One Direction's What Makes You Beautiful. But it's not plagiarism. It sounds similar because it's been produced by the same duo, Savan Kotecha and Carl Falk. Kotecha had his big career break working on The X Factor, and was the one of the people responsible for What Makes You Beautiful, one of the biggest pop songs of the 2010s. He then went on to write for some of the world's other biggest artists, including Ariana Grande and The Weeknd. But for the past few years, he's been working in film, with credits including the 2019 Charlie's Angels reboot and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. So he's come full circle by working on a film about boy bands. Kotecha says he initially agreed to be on the movie because he loves rom-coms. And as he's worked with acts like Westlife and One Direction, he was able to share his opinions about the boy band experience with the film's production team. ""We spoke a little bit about the characters,"" Kotecha says, speaking from LA before a writing session. ""They wanted to know a lot about what these characters would be going through. ""Even before One Direction, I've done this so much with Westlife and a bunch of other boy bands. ""So I gave my two cents of what I felt the character would be going through, and what was authentic and what wasn't authentic to the experience, at least from my point of view."" But, despite the comparisons with 1D, the songwriter says it was only after August Moon's song came out that he recognised the similarities. ""It sounds so dumb and naïve of me,"" he said. ""But I didn't think about it. ""We were like, 'Oh, this feels very 1975-ish' and then as soon as it was released, I started seeing people saying that [it was like What Makes You Beautiful]. I was like, 'Oh, yeah, of course'."" The film is based on a 2017 book of the same name by Robinne Lee. It stars Anne Hathaway as Solène, a 40-year-old single mum who falls for lead singer Hayes Campbell, played by Nicholas Galitzine, after they meet at the Coachella festival. It's a kind of forbidden romance, as Solène's teenage daughter is there to see August Moon, the band Hayes is in. Some publications, including GQ , have suggested the film is essentially based on Harry Styles fanfiction. But when the author was asked by Vogue in 2020 if The Idea of You was based on Styles, she said the One Direction singer was only one of her inspirations, along with a bit of Prince Harry and Eddie Redmayne. Despite the similarities, Kotecha maintains August Moon weren't set up to copy One Direction. ""Everyone's going to think that we're making this up, but other than the fact that they're boy bands, we didn't really talk about One Direction at all in that process,"" he says. ""I think the comparison has become a social media thing more than like a real comparison when we were making it. ""And even talking to the lead actor Nicholas, that wasn't really a part of the conversation."" That's something Galitzine himself has repeated, telling Variety he wasn't seeking inspiration from Styles. ""It's funny because it's not a comparison I've ever made,"" he said. ""But people really like to make it. ""Hayes Campbell, the man I'm playing, is a very different character, and we want him to exist in his own world."" Occasionally posting covers on social media with a guitar, it's perhaps not surprising that Galitzine - who's previously appeared in Red, White & Royal Blue - was cast as the boy band's lead singer. And Kotecha says he's got ""real singing chops"". ""He's obviously such a great actor, but I was really impressed with how good a singer he is,"" he adds. ""You'll see when you watch the movie and hear the rest of the songs, he's got a dynamic voice and can do a lot of different things with it."" Without spoiling it too much, Kotecha says the film's music follows the typical path of a boy band - early pop domination, then going a bit edgier, and solo careers. ""It was really thought through and all the music represents a trajectory of the boy band - like the first very poppy single, then up to the guy going solo,"" he says. And while they might have been able to imagine a boy band for the big screen, Kotecha jokes there isn't a magic recipe for a pop group's success in real life. ""It's lightning in a bottle,"" he says. ""They have to be charismatic, talented kids, and they have to have chemistry together. I don't think you can ever teach that. ""And then obviously, great songs too - and hopefully we did that with August Moon. ""But if it was something that was just a formula, we would do it all day every day.""",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68554935,entertainment
192,EastEnders star named as next Death in Paradise lead detective,"Former EastEnders star Don Gilet is swapping Walford for idyllic Saint Marie, as he is named as the new lead detective in BBC's hit show Death in Paradise. Known for playing the villainous Lucas Johnson in EastEnders, the British actor will play Detective Inspector Mervin Wilson, which he said is like being given an ""incredibly precious jewel"". Death in Paradise was the second most watched drama in 2023, with 8.3 million viewers. Gilet will make his debut in this year's Christmas special. ""This is a big show, with a big heart and the love continually grows for it,"" Gilet said. “Being offered the new lead role in Death in Paradise feels like a deeply loved and incredibly precious jewel has been placed in my hands."" Gilet - who has already begun filming in Guadeloupe - said he intends to remain ""grateful, humbled and dedicated"" to the programme. ""Even during those testing times when every sinew is screaming at me to run off the set and dive into the sea, swimming pool or an ice-cold beer – whichever happens to be closer at the time!” The detective drama, set against a backdrop of shimmering seas and sun-soaked beaches, will air its 14th series on BBC One in 2025. Gilet's character, DI Wilson, will arrive in the fictional island of Saint Marie from London, and is said not to be ""overly pleased with his new surroundings"", according to the show's press release. He takes on the role of lead detective following the exit of Ralf Little's DI Neville Parker. He will be the show's fifth lead detective, also following actors Ben Miller, Kris Marshall and Ardal O'Hanlon.

The British group, headed by frontman Tom Chaplin, said they were ""absolutely gutted"" by the news and were doing ""all we can to re-schedule the show"". A post on X read: ""This is due to ongoing technical issues at the venue and is entirely beyond our control."" It comes after hundreds of fans arrived at the new £365m venue on Wednesday to see rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, only to be handed letters saying the gig was cancelled due to technical reasons. Earlier the American artist, real name Julius Dubose, announced he will perform at a rival venue. It was the latest in a series of cancellations as the UK's largest arena's opening schedule was hit by various problems. Posting on X, he said: ""Yesterday's cancelled Manchester show has been rescheduled for this Saturday at AO Arena!  We won't give up that easy let's go!""

A poster promoting the new gig, posted online by AO Arena, said tickets from the cancelled show would remain valid for Saturday. A spokesman for the arena said further information would be released by Ticketmaster in due course. Fans were left disappointed after the chaotic last-minute cancellation on Wednesday, with one telling the BBC it was ""very unprofessional"", while another criticised the ""bad organisation"". On Wednesday night OVG apologised to fans, explaining the gig had been cancelled after a nozzle used in the building's ventilation system became detached during a sound-check. Co-op Group, which own the naming rights to the arena, released a statement expressing ""shock"" at the cancellation and said it would be ""seeking a full explanation"" from OVG. The arena said any fans who had paid for parking would also be refunded .

194,Four presenters lose part of legal challenge against BBC,"Four female presenters have lost a bid to take legal action against the BBC on grounds of equal pay, a judge ruled. However, their separate claims including sex and age discrimination will go to a full employment tribunal. The BBC has rejected their complaints and successfully argued the women had no grounds to bring an equal pay claim. Martine Croxall, Annita McVeigh, Karin Giannone and Kasia Madera said they ""remain committed to seeking equal pay"". A BBC spokesperson said: ""We are pleased with the result and that the tribunal has accepted our position. We will not be commenting further at this stage."" The four newsreaders have been attending a two-day preliminary hearing in central London, which concluded on Thursday. A three-week tribunal to hear their claims against the broadcaster will now be held in March 2025. Croxall, McVeigh, Giannone and Madera were given the go-ahead to have their cases heard jointly at that hearing, which the BBC had opposed. All four presenters alleged they have not been paid equally compared with an equivalent male presenter since February 2020. ""The BBC grinds you down on pay,"" Croxall told the hearing on Wednesday. On Thursday, the judge ruled that the claim relating to equal pay could not go ahead, because Croxall, McVeigh, Giannone and Madera had previously agreed equal pay settlements with the corporation. The judge's ruling means equal pay will not be included at next year's tribunal. The group, who are aged 48-55, have all been familiar faces on the BBC's TV channels. They separately claim they lost their roles on the BBC News Channel following a ""rigged"" recruitment exercise. The BBC insists its application process was ""rigorous and fair"". In court documents, it said: ""It is denied that [the BBC] has subjected [the presenters] to age or sex discrimination, harassment or victimisation, or has breached the sex equality clause."" In a joint statement, Croxall, McVeigh, Giannone and Madera said: ""We are pleased the tribunal has agreed our four discrimination claims should be heard together, claims the BBC's lawyers tried to split, which would have necessitated eight hearings at great additional expense to the licence fee payer. ""We remain committed to seeking equal pay despite the BBC's lawyers relying on a novel argument to prevent our claims progressing.

195,Event celebrates Caribbean sound system culture,"Birmingham is set to host an event celebrating Caribbean sound system culture. It’s a musical tradition that was brought to the country by the Windrush generation  in the 1950s and has a solid foundation in the West Midlands. It comprises groups of DJs, engineers and MCs, using huge loudspeakers and amplifiers to enhance the deep bass of reggae music, whilst performing to big audiences. On Sunday, an event, World Bash UK, will celebrate the culture at Birmingham's O2 Academy hosting a number of international artists. The trend originated in Kingston, Jamaica, in the middle of the 20th Century. It offered a safe haven for those of Caribbean heritage in the UK , as they often found pubs and clubs to be hostile environments. The Windrush Generation refers to the 500,000 people who were invited to the UK and left the West Indies between 1948 and 1971 to help rebuild Britain after it was ravaged by World War Two. Sound system built on the experiences of the Windrush Generation who created their own parties known as blues - somewhere they could unwind and relax. Luv Injection, which was formed in 1986, is one of the city’s longest running sound systems. Its founder Winston Mexican said: “When they came to England, there were no sound systems here so people built sound systems to reconnect back to Jamaica.” During the 1970s, 80s and 90s, Handsworth in Birmingham was the go-to spot where many of the original sound systems, including Mafia tone and Wassifa Showcase, played at house parties to entertain crowds until the early hours of the morning. Marvin Elliott, of Empire Sound, said: “To keep the music alive, all we’re doing is trying to transition the music from that generation to this generation.” World Bash UK will feature key players including Bass Odyssey, LP International, Bodyguard, Code Red, Dynamq, Killamanjaro, David Rodigan, Saxon,Empire Sound, Luv Injection and V Rocket International. Organisers have said it’s the first time ever so many international world-renowned sound-systems will be under one roof together in the UK, and the West Midlands is the natural home for the event. The founder of World Bash UK, Garfield ‘Chin’ Bourne, said: “People want to keep that connection with their culture, even if they don’t live in Jamaica or the Caribbean, they still want to be able to witness the Caribbean culture in the cities and towns that they reside in.” Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X, and Instagram , Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wzx0279ymo,entertainment
196,"I spent £1,500 on trip to see Olivia Rodrigo at Co-op Live","Danielle Nolan decided to treat her 10-year-old daughter to tickets to see Olivia Rodrigo at the Co-op Live arena as a Christmas present - spending £500 on tickets and hundreds more on flights and hotels. But her daughter's dream gig became an ""absolute nightmare"", after the  £365m Manchester venue had to call off the singer-songwriter's concerts this weekend and postpone its opening again. ""She is absolutely gutted,"" Ms Nolan, 36, from Belfast, tells BBC News. ""I have cried all morning. ""All in, for flights, hotel tickets and outfits, it has cost me over £1,500."" Speaking about how the arena's bosses have handled its launch, Ms Nolan says: ""I'm disgusted. ""If the venue wasn't up to standards, why are they offering sellout shows? ""There will be people traveling from all over, at the cost of a lot of money, who will be absolutely devastated now."" Marie Imrie, from Wakefield, W Yorks, was due to see Rodrigo with her 11-year-old daughter. She was initially reluctant to book tickets at a new venue because of the risk of delays but ""simply couldn't miss the chance to make her happy"". It would have been her daughter's first concert and she has been left ""in floods of tears"". ""It honestly broke my heart to tell her, as she was surrounded by her bracelet sets - busy making bracelets for the concert,"" Ms Imrie says. ""I have paid hundreds of pound for tickets, then didn't want to be stranded late in the centre of Manchester, so booked a £200 hotel. ""I understand safety is paramount - but I just don't understand why Co-op booked artists so close to the finishing date. ""Common sense would prevail that issues would arise. ""I wish I hadn't placed trust in them in the first place."" William Bruce, from Larkhall, Lanarkshire, was also going to take his 11-year-old daughter - who was in tears all night, after discovering the news. ""The money doesn't matter - but my daughter's feelings do,"" he says. ""I've got a grievance with the whole arena. ""The management must have had a plan. ""Perhaps they shouldn't have booked the artists so close to the completion time. ""It's not just the money, it's the emotional impact on people. ""It all feels a little rushed.""

""I fought to get these tickets and it's just been snatched from under my nose at the last minute,"" Aimee tells BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme. ""It's just awful."" Grace says she had ""never been so happy in my entire life"" as when she was given the tickets. ""It was amazing,"" she says. ""And we've been waiting for it for ages. ""We were so ready for it - my outfit was in my wardrobe - and then it got taken away last night."" It is ""annoying and upsetting"", Grace says. ""They've been hyping it up for so long - and they've been reassuring everybody about how all the concerts are going to go on,"" she says. ""It is embarrassing."" The arena's operators, Oak View Group, have said they are ""deeply sorry for all those impacted"". The latest cancellations come after a heating and ventilation pipe broke during US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's soundcheck, on Wednesday.

197,At-risk museum boosted by popular exhibition,"A museum that was struggling to pay its running costs has been boosted by public support for a popular exhibition. Dorset Museum and Art Gallery credited the  increased footfall to a display celebrating the late sculptor Elisabeth Frink. Elisabeth Frink: A View from Within explored her artistic and personal life in Dorset, as well as the influences that shaped her work. Museum executive director Claire Dixon said: ""We're not out of the woods yet but it just goes to show what can happen if you get the right exhibition to the right people."" In January the museum, in Dorchester's High West Street, was awarded a grant of £250,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a further £150,000, spread over three years, from Dorset Council. Despite this Ms Dixon said it was struggling financially after visitor numbers had fallen and running costs had increased following a £16.4m construction project that finished in 2021. The Elisabeth Frink exhibition was on show from December to April, and Ms Dixon said the feedback was ""incredible"". ""It proves that if we get it right then people love it,"" she said. She added that Elisabeth Frink is ""having her moment"" and it is ""good to see a female sculpture get the recognition she deserves"". The museum attracted visitors from outside of the county as well as locally, Ms Dixon said. The team is working on improving its digital strategy to reach tourists visiting Dorset this summer.

198,"Comedy doesn't work if you're literal-minded, says Cleese","John Cleese has said catering for ""literal-minded"" audience members is ""always a problem"" with comedy. The writer and actor was speaking at the launch of a stage adaptation of Fawlty Towers, which is about to open in London. Cleese acknowledged that some lines of dialogue have been removed due to changing societal expectations. But he said comedy writing is generally more difficult because of viewers who ""don't understand metaphor, irony, or comic exaggeration"". Cleese has merged three of the most popular episodes of Fawlty Towers into one over-arching narrative for the two-hour play. They are Communication Problems, The Hotel Inspectors and the more controversial episode The Germans. ""There was a scene where the major used a couple of words you can't use now, racial slurs, so we took that out,"" Cleese told journalists on Thursday. But he added that writers are also ""up against"" people who interpret jokes literally, sometimes not allowing for a scene's tone or set-up. ""You see, there's always a problem with comedy that you deal with the literal-minded,"" Cleese said. ""I remind you of Till Death Us Do Part,"" Cleese said, referring to the Alf Garnett, the lead character of the1960s sitcom who would regularly make highly offensive comments. ""People were roaring with laughter at him, not with him. But there were also people saying ' thank God these things are being said at last'. ""So whenever you're doing comedy, you're up against the literal-minded. And the literal-minded don't understand irony, so that means if you take them seriously, you get rid of a lot of comedy, because the literal-minded don't understand metaphor, irony, comic exaggeration. ""And the result is, if you listen to them, these are people who are not, so far as understanding what human beings are saying and doing, they're not playing with a full deck. ""Literal-minded people can only have one interpretation of what's being said. People who are not literal-minded can see there are different interpretations depending on different contexts."" His comments come four years after The Germans was temporarily removed from some streaming services and reinstated with a warning about ""offensive content and language"". The cast of the stage adaptation of Fawlty Towers performed two scenes for journalists at Thursday's press launch. Both extracts were almost entirely faithful to their original TV scripts, with few changes made or new jokes added. Asked by BBC News if he was worried that some of the jokes have become so famous that they might lose some of their comedic impact, Cleese noted that the stage show would evolve and change as the cast began to understand the theatre audiences and improvise new sections. ""We kept the best stuff, the best scenes, and the more [the actors] play it, the more they will invent new stuff,"" Cleese said. ""And when people see the show when it opens, if they came eight weeks later, they'd be very surprised at how different it is, because people react and start playing with it."" He added: ""I think it will be tremendous, but it'll be tremendous in June, once [the cast] have figured out where the laughs are and exactly how to play them."" Although some of the more contentious language has been removed, the principal characters and the physical violence Cleese sometimes directs towards them remain intact. In the stage show, Basil (played by Adam Jackson-Fox) is seen trying to restrain a guest who starts complaining about the service in front of someone Basil suspects is a hotel inspector. He is also seen slapping Manuel and hitting him on the head with a hard spoon, but it's clear a lot of thought has gone into staging such moves safely. In contrast, the late Andrew Sachs, who originally played Manuel, previously recalled being physically injured by some of Basil's actions. Writing in the Telegraph last week, Cleese defended the character of Manuel against suggestions that a useless Spanish waiter (who was being played by an English actor) was an offensive 1970s stereotype. Cleese said: ""Manuel was simply a character with whom there could be constant misunderstandings and I’ve always found misunderstandings to be very funny."" The two-hour play was previously staged in Australia, but this is the first time it has come to the West End. Set in a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, Fawlty Towers followed an irritable hotel owner who was frequently rude to demanding guests. In the play, Basil will be seen attempting to be unusually courteous to guests following a tip-off that inspectors may be visiting hotels in the area. But his plans are disrupted by a party of German guests and a particularly challenging customer, Mrs Richards. Asked how he had gone about merging the three episodes, which will bring together all three endings, Cleese said: ""It's what I call carpentry. ""We chose Mrs Richards because everyone loves that, it's a wonderful character. And we chose [The Hotel Inspectors] and then of course we had to do the Germans, and then we had to figure out how we dovetail together. ""Because they start at different times and people move from one story to another. Which means that it's pretty action packed."" Cleese argues that Fawlty Towers lends itself better to a theatrical environment than television, because audiences can see everything happening on stage. ""Farce is better played in the theatre than anywhere else. Because once you're on television, then there's a guy called an editor who makes a choice about where to look. ""But in a theatre you want to sit in the middle of the stalls, not too close, and then you see all the different things that are going on at the same time."" In keeping with farcical tradition, Fawlty Towers regularly involved characters doing something in the background unnoticed by the characters in the foreground. The show will premiere at London's Apollo Theatre on Saturday (4 May). Cleese co-wrote the original TV series with his then-wife Connie Booth, who also starred in the series as Polly. Despite being considered one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, only 12 half-hour episodes of Fawlty Towers were ever produced. The first series aired in 1975, the second in 1979. Cleese explained on Thursday: ""We felt after 12 shows that we'd done the best we could possibly do, and that if we did another series people would probably say 'well it was very funny, but it wasn't as good as the first two series'. In which case why do it if you're not desperate for the money?"" The sitcom was famously based on a real-life hotel owner, Donald Sinclair. Cleese came up with the idea for the show when he stayed at Sinclair's Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay and became fascinated with his incredibly rude behaviour. Last year, it was reported Cleese planned to write and star in new episodes alongside his daughter Camilla. Last month, Cleese said he was hoping to return to the project later this year. ""It’s a modern update in which Basil goes out to the Caribbean where his long-lost daughter is a hotelier and wants a bit of help. But he will still be repressed and trapped. That’s his condition.""",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c90z18q2egpo,entertainment
199,Anger as Rodrigo joins Co-op Live cancellations,"Ticket-holders for Olivia Rodrigo's gigs at Manchester's crisis-hit Co-op Live arena have told the BBC they are angry and devastated after her shows were called off. The US singer was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new £365m venue this weekend. Those were due to be among the arena's first shows, but its opening plans have been hit by a string of delays and technical problems. The venue was finally expected to officially launch with a show by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie on Wednesday. But that was called off at the last minute as thousands of fans were already queuing outside, after an incident when part of the heating and ventilation system became detached. There is now uncertainty over when the venue will open, with Keane and Take That still scheduled to perform there in the coming days. The arena, which is set to be the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was originally due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week. His shows have been postponed twice. Rodrigo, one of the world's biggest pop stars, was due to perform for about 40,000 people at the venue on Friday and Saturday. The chart-topping star told fans she was ""sooooo disappointed"" not to perform. ""I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,"" the Drivers License hitmaker wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were ""doing our best"" to reschedule the concerts. Catherine Pugh, from near Leeds, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell she bought tickets for her daughter, who had spent three months in hospital last year. Her daughter ""instantly put a countdown on her phone"" and the family splashed out on new outfits and booked a hotel, she said. When the concert was postponed, she said ""the devastation my daughter is feeling is palpable and the concern is it impacts her recovery, I feel so sad for her"". Dean McAllister, from Newcastle, told the station he bought tickets for his daughter as a surprise Christmas present. He said he didn't know how to tell his daughter the bad news. ""I was angry last night and I've been up since 05:30 wondering what to do. She took it better than I did - it's been poorly managed from the top to the bottom,"" he added. Scott Tostevin was due to fly from Guernsey with his friend and her daughter to see Rodrigo to celebrate her 18th birthday. He estimated the trio had spent more than £1,000 on flights and hotels. In a statement, the arena's operators Oak View Group said they were ""deeply sorry"" for the upheaval. They blamed Wednesday's problems on an incident during the soundcheck when ""a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork"". They said no-one was injured, but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects. The Co-operative Group, which sponsors the venue, said it was ""shocked"" by the developments and was ""seeking a full explanation from Oak View Group"".

200,Gig tickets: What are your rights if a concert gets postponed?,"A wasted journey, hundreds of quid down the drain, and feeling more than a little gutted. Your favourite artist or band having their gig called off is never ideal - especially when you've already made plans to see them. It's a feeling fans of Olivia Rodrigo, Peter Kay and others know all too well at the moment, after their performances at Manchester's much-memed Co-Op live venue were postponed due to ""technical issues"". Singer Olivia's told fans how ""bummed"" she is that her show's not going ahead - but that doesn't get punters their money back. So what should you do if your favourite act is cancelled? It's probably something most of us skip or skim through - but it's important to read the small print when you buy a ticket, says Harry Kind from consumer group Which?. ""You have the right to a refund for a ticket that you've bought directly from the venue, or from the artist, if it has been postponed,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat. Even if the gig is rescheduled, Harry says, you should still be clear to claim your money back. ""It's a fantastic power that you have, and you don't have to turn up to the new date if it's not one that works for you."" But refunds get a bit more tricky if you've bought your tickets from third-party sites. ""If you bought that ticket from a reseller, maybe from a company like Viagogo or StubHub, then your rights aren't quite as set in stone,"" says Harry. ""It's going to depend on the terms and conditions. ""You might then be forced either to resell the ticket or to turn up to the new concert later in the year."" If you've spent money on trains, travel and accommodation, what're your options? Which? says you can claim for transport and accommodation costs, depending on the terms of your ticket, and it encourages people to try this. But Harry thinks that, unfortunately, this is where you're most likely to lose out. ""I'm afraid it's really unlikely you're going to be getting that money back,"" he says. ""If you've bought a ticket that has the right to a refund, then that's great - you should be claiming that. ""Same with a hotel, check if you've got that flexibility. ""Even if you haven't, maybe try reaching out to them and saying: 'This is the situation I'm in, can I just switch my booking for later in the year?'. ""But otherwise, it's down to travel insurance. ""If you happen to have travel insurance, it might be worth making a claim on this to try and get that money back so that you can visit again later in the year."" Has your booked gig been postponed? You can get in touch in the following ways: Whether it's illness or venue problems, ""sadly, this comes up all the time,"" says Harry. So what are his tips to avoid being empty-handed if your fave artist breaks your heart? ""The safest way to buy a ticket will always be buying directly from the artist, from the venue, from the promoter,"" says Harry. ""If you buy from a second-hand marketplace, your rights aren't as strong."" Harry thinks it might also be an idea to pay with your credit or debit card. ""Potentially - if you're not getting the refund that you're entitled to - if there has been some change, you could, for example, say 'I want to make a claim'. ""It's a bit of a process you've got to apply for it but it might be worth a try - and sometimes that will shift people along."" Co-Op Live's opening concerts have been called off due to safety concerns over a fault with its ventilation system. The next shows due to take place at the £365m venue are a gig by indie band Keane on Sunday and five-night residency by 90s boyband Take That next week. Venue sponsors the Co-operative Group said they were ""shocked"" by the cancellations and said it understood ""the need to reassure fans over future shows"". It apologised for any inconvenience but did not rule out further postponements. The group said it was working with artists, promoters and managers to limit the impact on its schedule, and would try to give fans ""sufficient notice"" if further cancellations were necessary. ""Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred,"" they added.

201,ELO keyboardist Richard Tandy dies at age of 76,"Electric Light Orchestra keyboardist Richard Tandy has died at the age of 76. The news was shared by the Birmingham rock group’s founder Jeff Lynne, who described Tandy as a “remarkable musician”. Tandy was credited with helping to shape the sound of the band known for hits including Mr Blue Sky and Last Train to London. Lynne wrote on social media: ""It is with great sadness that I share the news of the passing of my long-time collaborator and dear friend Richard Tandy. ""He was a remarkable musician and friend and I'll cherish the lifetime of memories we had together. ""Sending all my love to Sheila and the Tandy family."" Tandy was born in Birmingham and officially joined ELO after the release of the group's first album in 1972. He initially played bass guitar but became the keyboardist after Roy Wood left. He also played the Minimoog synthesiser, a Wurlitzer electric piano, the clavinet, Mellotron and piano, while also lending his voice to 1977's Mr Blue Sky. Tandy was a core member of the band alongside Lynne and drummer Bev Bevan until they split in 1986. When Lynne reformed the band as Jeff Lynne's ELO in 2014, Tandy joined again. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the band in 2017, and was described as Lynne's multi-instrumentalist, co-orchestrator and valued musical partner. Bev Bevan, ELO's drummer from 1970 to 1986, said he first came across Tandy when he was with The Move in the late 60s. He said the late musician was an amazing pianist and that there was no keyboard he could not play. He told BBC Radio WM: ""He was a really dedicated musician. He really studied his craft."" Bevan described Tandy as a quiet man, who was not a showman but played a key role in creating ELO's music. He said: ""His real forte was in the studio. He was Jeff Lynne's right-hand man and was with Jeff all the time in the studio. I couldn't drag them out."" Bevan added: ""I have nothing but fond memories of him. He was a lovely, lovely guy.""

202,Met Gala: Seven of the best looks over the decades,"From Cher's naked dress to Rihanna's ""omelette gown"", the gala has seen many iconic looks. As the fashion event of the year approaches, Ellie Violet Bramley looks back at some of its magic moments. ""The first Monday in May"" has come to be known as the night the fashion industry lets its hair well and truly down. There are stunts, frocks the size of caravans and selfies that go on to be seen by millions of people all over the planet. But it started more humbly. Eleanor Lambert, the publicist and ""godmother of fashion"", launched the Met Gala 76 years ago in 1948 as a fundraiser for the new Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, John Tiffany, her former mentee and biographer, tells the BBC. More broadly, he adds, it was a way to ""raise the visibility of American fashion"". The $50 tickets were sold to members of New York high society. More like this: - How the naked look took over fashion - The rise of the minimalist wardrobe - Why the super-rich love understated dressing Even then, though, it was a chance to have some fun. ""During the war, New Yorkers had to black out their windows and keep the lights off, so for the original Met Gala in 1948, Lambert created a 'Midnight Dinner' to let loose."" It has been through many twists and turns since. ""From 1948 until the 1970s, the goal was to look impeccable, embracing one's own style while celebrating American fashion on the storied steps of the Met,"" says Tiffany. It was under the tenure of US fashion editor Diana Vreeland in the 1970s that the event became more elaborate, with the introduction of themes spicing things up and the guestlist extending to cultural types such as Andy Warhol, as well as society figures like Jackie Kennedy. But it was in 1995 that the single biggest shift in its history arrived in the shape of a bob: this was the year that Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour took over.  While many things about the Met Gala today have been seriously ratcheted up, then as now it is about raising money. ""The Met Gala is likely to be Anna Wintour's biggest career achievement,"" Amy Odell, fashion journalist and best-selling author of Anna: The Biography, tells the BBC. ""It has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the Costume Institute at the museum, owing to Anna succeeding in raising the ticket price from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars since she started planning it."" This year's tickets are reported to be selling for an eye-watering $50,000. The night is as much about what is seen as what isn't, because while the front steps are home to a galaxy's worth of flashing cameras, the festivities inside are shrouded in secrecy. ""Part of the elitism of the event is its mystique,"" says Odell. ""What separates those who get invited from everyone else? What really happens inside the party? These questions keep the public interested in the event, thus any scrap of information we get about it becomes a news item, fuelling further intrigue."" Wintour's Met Gala is an all-couture-blazing sartorial spectacle. It is a barometer for our times, albeit a richly gilded one, and a chance to see what a lot of cash, creativity and confidence can do. For some, it will always be shamelessly extravagant, for others, this is where its brilliance lies. Here, we take a look at some of the most iconic Met Gala moments through the years: Cher in the Bob Mackie ""naked dress"" 1974: Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design ""Cher and Bob Mackie broke all the rules that night and showed how glamorous Hollywood was at that very moment,"" says Tiffany. ""It might not have worked on anyone else, but Cher had the confidence and Bob Mackie understood exactly how far he could go."" This might have been nearly 50 years ago, but the naked dress trend is as of this moment as it was that one.  Diana Ross 1981: The 18th-Century Woman Like a millefuille made of feathers, The Supremes singer's outfit is one of the most attention-grabbing of the more understated earlier years of the gala. ""Diana Ross changed the conversation from 18th-Century woman to Miss Ross that night!"" says Tiffany. She even re-wore the dress many years later to the 2012 American Music Awards. Rihanna's Guo Pei ""omelette dress"" 2015: China: Through the Looking Glass For Chinese couturier Guo Pei , who had been designing couture for more than 30 years by the time Rihanna wore this yolk-yellow dress, having her work dubbed the ""omelette dress"", and heavily memed, was an unexpected way to become internet-famous around the globe. The cape had taken more than 50,000 hours to hand embroider and weighed 25kg. Even if it was perhaps a complicated moment for Guo, it was one that Wintour, according to Odell, really loved: ""[she] actually loves the over-the-top looks"". The theme was Catholicism, and producer, writer and actor Lena Waithe wore a cape showing the city of Philadelphia ' s revised pride flag, with added black and brown stripes to call attention to concerns affecting LGBTQ+ people of colour. ""I'm reppin' my community, and I want everybody to know that you can be whoever you are, and be completely proud, and be doin' it,"" she told Vogue on the night. Underneath she wore a Carolina Herrera tuxedo. It was, Tiffany notes, ""a sophisticated but very chic look combined with her powerful message. It made a huge impact."" Also noteworthy from this night was Rihanna who effectively dressed up as the pope. While, according to Tiffany, ""no one confused her with the Holy See,"" she may have ""inspired a few Cardinals to submit her name at the next Papal Conclave wishing for their first female Pope."" Billy Porter's grand entrance 2019: Camp: Notes on Fashion ""The theme was camp, Billy clearly understood the assignment,"" says Tiffany, of the Pose star's arrival on the red carpet as a winged Egyptian pharoah. Carried by shirtless, gold-adorned attendants, he was set down only to sprout golden wings. As Porter told Variety: ""Camp means irreverence. Camp means as hugely over-the-top and grand and what some may feel is ridiculous and silly, and embracing all of those creative impulses inside us that very often are squelched."" This was also the year that Lady Gaga chewed through four outfits by Brandon Maxwell on the red carpet, bringing Wintour out from the entrance inside the museum, where she greets guests, to watch it – the first time, according to Odell, that she watched a red-carpet entrance. It was also the year Jared Leto carried a model of his own head to the gala, although there are no reports Wintour made it out for this. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ""tax the rich"" gown 2021: In America: A Lexicon of Fashion Hypocritical or some much-needed radicalism, when the New York congresswoman wore a white gown by black female designer Aurora James emblazoned with the phrase ""tax the rich"" in red, it certainly got people talking. As Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Instagram at the time: ""The medium is the message… The time is now for childcare, healthcare, and climate action for all. Tax the Rich."" But while the white wool slogan dress has gone on to be the most searched-for Met Gala look on Google , the dress worn by Kim Kardashian deserves special mention, too. A collaboration between Balenciaga's Demna Gvasalia and Kardashian's ex-husband, Kanye West, it was a bold look that saw the woman with one of the most recognised faces – and bodies – in the world,  covered from head to toe. As the design duo well knew, the Met is the place for going all out. Blake Lively's metamorphosing dress 2022: Gilded Glamour The theme asked attendees to look to New York's Gilded era, which roughly spanned the 1870s to the dawn of the 20th Century, and saw a boom in wealth as a result of industrialisation. Not one to ignore a brief, Gossip Girl actor Blake Lively wore a Versace dress that was an ode to New York City in that age, changing colour from turquoise to copper midway up the red carpet in a transformation that was intended to represent the oxidisation of the Statue of Liberty. The dress was influenced more by architecture than by fashion, with nods to other behemoths of the city's skyline, such as the Empire State Building, as well as the star-filled ceiling of Grand Central station. It was a fitting look for New York City's most glamorous event. A version of this article was published in 2023.

203,Children's TV exec files lawsuit over documentary,"Former Nickelodeon producer and writer Dan Schneider has filed a defamation legal case against the producers of a TV documentary series, claiming it has ""irreparably harmed"" his reputation. The five-part docuseries, released in March, alleged years of abuse and inappropriate behaviour at shows including iCarly and Drake & Josh. Schneider said Quiet On Set: The Dark Side Of Kids TV falsely implied he ""sexually abused the children who worked on his television shows"". The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Press Association said the documents name producers Maxine Productions, Sony Pictures Television and Warner Brothers Discovery as defendants. The BBC has contacted the defendants for comment. Nickelodeon, which is not involved in the case, told the Associated Press in a statement on the series that it cannot “corroborate or negate” allegations from decades ago, but it investigates all formal complaints and has rigorous protocols for working minors. “Our highest priorities are the wellbeing and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crew, but of all children and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.” The docuseries, which was originally broadcast on US streaming platform Max, includes several allegations of Mr Schneider making inappropriate and sexual jokes on-set. Schneider created hit shows including iCarly, Victorious, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101 and The Amanda Show. He apologised in March for his ""embarrassing"" on-set behaviour at the children's channel and left it in 2018 after an investigation found that he was verbally abusive to staff members. The court documents said that although two people who worked on Nickelodeon shows were later convicted of sexual offences, Schneider ""had no knowledge of their abuse, was not complicit in the abuse, condemned the abuse once it was discovered and, critically, was not a child sexual abuser himself"". ""But for the sake of clickbait, ratings, and views - or put differently, money - defendants have destroyed Schneider's reputation and legacy through the false statements and implications that Schneider is exactly that,"" the case said. ""Schneider never sexually abused a child, nor has he been charged or convicted with sexually abusing a child. ""The trailer and Quiet On Set's statements and implications to the contrary are both false and made with reckless and malicious disregard for the truth."" Schneider told the Press Association: ""Recently the docuseries Quiet On Set highlighted mistakes I made and poor judgement I exhibited during my time at Nickelodeon, most of which happened decades ago during my early career as a producer. ""There is no doubt that I was sometimes a bad leader. ""I am sincerely apologetic and regretful for that behaviour, and I will continue to take accountability for it. ""However, after seeing Quiet On Set and its trailer, and the reactions to them, I sadly have no choice but to take legal action against the people behind it. ""In their successful attempt to mislead viewers and increase ratings, they went beyond reporting the truth and falsely implied that I was involved in or facilitated horrific crimes for which actual child predators have been prosecuted and convicted. ""I have no objection to anyone highlighting my failures as a boss, but it is wrong to mislead millions of people to the false conclusion that I was in any way involved in heinous acts like those committed by child predators. ""I owe it to myself, my family, and the many wonderful people involved in making these shows to set the record straight.""",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0v0rd3e42qo,entertainment
204,Olivia Rodrigo's Manchester tour dates fall foul of Co-op Live arena fiasco,"US singer Olivia Rodrigo has expressed her disappointment after becoming the latest act to fall foul of a crisis at Manchester's troubled Co-op Live arena. She was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new venue this weekend, but they have been called off. The decision came after the arena's opening was postponed for a third time on Wednesday when a fault scuppered a gig by rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie. Rodrigo told fans she was ""sooooo disappointed"" not to perform her shows. ""I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,"" the chart-topping pop star wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were ""doing our best"" to reschedule the concerts. Rodrigo's fans have also had their plans wrecked, with many left out of pocket. Scott Tostevin, from Guernsey, had booked flights and a hotel for himself and two friends to see her on Friday night. He told the BBC the group had spent several hundred pounds on the trip. ""I can either use my flights and hotel to now sit and watch a film in Manchester or lose the money and just cancel it all with no refunds,"" he said. The decision to postpone major shows by one of the world's biggest artists is another big embarrassment for the Manchester arena after a series of delays. The £365m venue, the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week, but his shows have been postponed twice. Bosses decided Rodrigo's shows could not go ahead after A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's concert was cancelled at the last minute on Wednesday. Thousands of his fans were waiting outside the venue when they were informed about the announcement, which came 10 minutes after doors had been due to open. The arena's operators blamed an incident during the soundcheck, when ""a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork"". They said no-one had been injured and that they were ""deeply sorry"", but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects. Ticket-holders, many of whom had travelled for miles, were left disappointed, and the rapper wrote on social media: ""I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info."" One fan told the BBC it was ""very unprofessional"", while another criticised the ""bad organisation"". The venue's operators, Oak View Group, said they appreciated ""the inconvenience"" this would cause for ""many"". The fault had been caused by a ""factory defect"" with a nozzle used to direct air, they added. However, staff were unable to verify that other such nozzles were free of similar problems. Fan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus. The 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around £600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol. She said: ""We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'. ""Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena."" Ms Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead. Some fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for ""technical reasons"". Zack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. ""I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,"" he said. ""They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves."" Teoni Kirkham, 21, said: ""We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here. ""It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think."" The next show in the schedule is Keane on Sunday, followed by a five-night residency by Take That next week. The venue said it understood ""the need to reassure fans over future shows"", but did not rule out further postponements. ""We are working with artist management and promoters to limit the impact on the opening season schedule,"" its statement said. ""Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates, and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows. ""Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred."" Oak View Group chief executive Tim Leiweke apologised to fans but defended the cancellation. He added: ""The safety and security of all visiting and working on Co-op Live is our utmost priority, and we could not and will not run any event until it is absolutely safe to do so. ""Today was a very unexpected situation but without a doubt the right decision."" The Co-operative Group, which sponsors the venue, said it was ""shocked"" by what had happened. A spokesperson said: ""We are relieved that no-one has been injured, but we share the disappointment and frustration of ticket holders, many of whom are Co-op members, with the continuing delay to the opening of Co-op Live and the disruption that this is causing to everyone who has been looking forward to attending events. ""We will be seeking a full explanation from Oak View Group, who are responsible for the building, to the obvious questions arising from this, together with a clear plan from the Co-op Live venue management team at OVG for opening the venue and postponed and future events."" Last week, Co-op Live's general manager Gary Roden resigned following the initial delays and a backlash over comments he had made about some smaller live music venues being ""poorly run"". Rebecca Kane-Burton, who has run the O2 arena in London and Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber's LW Theatres, was drafted in to replace him. Rodrigo opened the European section of her Guts world tour in Dublin on Tuesday, but now has a gap in her diary before dates in Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Her tour made headlines in the US when contraceptives and morning-after pills were handed out at a concert in Missouri, where abortion is banned. Are you a worker at Co-op Live?

205,Comedian publishes book after social media success,"A Hampshire comedian has published a book after building a huge following on social media. Daniel Foxx, from Bishops Waltham, started doing open mic nights at university and said finding success was ""really hard work"". The 30-year-old's videos now get hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok, but he said he spent years recording and editing in his kitchen. His book, Bedtime Stories for Privileged Children, is available from September. Mr Foxx, who went to college at Peter Symonds in Winchester, said ""you hope one day you'll make it"". ""It wasn't an overnight success like people think,  it was a gradual process and really hard work,"" he said. His book began three years ago when he started “collecting ridiculous names that very posh people call their children”. Mr Foxx said his UK-wide tour, called Villain, will be at The Attic in Southampton from Saturday. He said: “I did a preview of the show in Southampton last year and I looked out into the audience and saw several school friends that I haven’t seen in like a decade. “It’s always slightly alarming when you have to start changing the name in that joke because they are there in front of you.” Follow BBC South on Facebook , X (Twitter) , or Instagram .

206,Art by Epsom refugee community put on display,"An exhibition showcasing artwork made by refugees has opened. Epsom and Ewell Borough Council launched an initiative to offer art sessions for adults and children from the borough’s refugee community. Artists from the social enterprise Creative Minds taught participants different methods of artistic expression during the free weekly sessions at Bourne Hall, Epsom. Councillor Clive Woodbridge said it allowed participants to “not only learn new skills, but build self-worth”. “Epsom & Ewell Refugee Network does an excellent job in building up a strong circle of support for those who are often trying to move away from upsetting experiences towards a more positive future,” he said. The exhibition, titled My Soul Gallery, is on show at Bourne Hall from 1 to 31 May. Jessica Brooks, the refugee network’s manager, said the teachers encouraged participants to use their imaginations and express their feelings through art. “This gave participants the opportunity to reflect on emotions in a calm and safe setting, while also exploring many different art mediums with a great range of resources available,” she said. Funding for the project came from the council’s Arts, Culture and Heritage and Community Development departments through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and Homes for Ukraine scheme.

207,'King of Twang' guitarist Duane Eddy dies at 86,"American guitarist Duane Eddy - hailed by many as one of the founding fathers of rock and roll - has died aged 86. His death occurred on 30 April in Franklin, Tennessee, his wife Deed said. The cause was cancer. The Grammy-winning artist had a run of instrumental hits in the 1950s and 60s. He reached the charts again in 1986 with a remake of his song Peter Gunn. He was called the King of Twang for his distinctive style. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2008, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum also made him its inductee. ""Duane inspired a generation of guitarists the world over with his unmistakeable signature 'Twang' sound,"" Eddy's representative was quoted as saying by Variety's website. ""He was the first rock and roll guitar god, a truly humble and incredible human being. He will be sorely missed."" Eddy was born in Corning, New York state, in 1938. He began playing the guitar at a young age. Eddy was self-taught and his distinctive sound inspired artists from The Beatles to Blondie. During his illustrious career spanning seven decades, he sold more than 100 million records. Echoes of his distinctive slow twang come through loud and clear on The Beatles' Day Tripper, Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run and Blondie's Atomic. In 2011, Eddy told the BBC: ""When people come right out, like Bruce Springsteen or John Fogerty, and say: 'Duane was a big influence,' that's just one of the perks and rewards of what I did. ""That's worth more to me than money and the fame. That goes right to the heart.""",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68940716,entertainment
208,Dua Lipa wants to turn this year's Glastonbury into a nightclub,"Talk about an upgrade. When Dua Lipa headlines Glastonbury this June, it will be her first appearance at Worthy Farm since playing the cramped John Peel stage in 2017. At the time, it was the biggest crowd she'd ever played to. People spilled out of the tent into the surrounding fields. Straight after the performance, she bounced off the stage into an interview with the BBC. But as she sat down, she winced. “I’ve done myself an injury,"" she confessed. ""I mashed my tailbone.” It was an aggravation of an old injury, caused by the whiplash intensity of her dancing. “I was doing all sorts of crazy stuff and when I got off stage, I could barely walk,” she admitted. Despite the pain, she was ecstatic. The gig felt like ""a massive step up”. At that point, Dua Lipa was not yet Dua Lipa: The globe-conquering, Brit Award-winning, pandemic-soundtracking, Barbie-starring purveyor of glossy disco pop. But one month later, she released the pastel-hued video for New Rules , and her career changed overnight. A number one in the UK, and her first hit in the US, the song's message of female solidarity propelled her into main pop-girl territory, after years of hustling behind the scenes. The song clocked up its three-billionth play on YouTube this January – just as Dua started ramping up the campaign for her highly anticipated third album, Radical Optimism. It’s a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New Rules to break a pattern of dating wrong ‘uns. “Before, I would see a red flag and be like, ‘Oh, how beautiful’,” she laughs. “It could be anything: One sly, demeaning comment that you brush off… and then you realise it's a pattern. “I’ve learned to not kid myself.” Those lessons permeate the album’s punchy, keyed-up dance anthems. On the singles Training Season and Houdini, she vets prospective partners, and shows the door to anyone who falls below her standards. The lyrics were inspired by a string of bad dates she endured after coming out of a two-year relationship with Anwar Hadid (brother of Bella and Gigi Hadid). But how does dating work for someone at Dua Lipa’s level of fame? Are people intimidated to ask her out? “I don't know if people feel free to approach me,” Dua muses. “Maybe? “Dating apps, for me, I don't think would work. They might think they’re being catfished. “I like to go on a friend’s recommendation. It makes it easier when they're vetted."" When a match is made, her expectations for a first date are charmingly unstarry. “I like a walk in the park,"" she says. ""You can chat and walk and get to know someone. No frills. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy. “Having a good conversation is the best thing. That's how you see if you gel, if there's a spark.” For now, at least, that's not a concern. Dua has been in a relationship with British actor Callum Turner since the beginning of the year. And her personal life will have to take a back seat as she gears up for a busy summer. Radical Optimism is released on Friday, with Dua hosting and singing on Saturday Night Live a day later (the last British artist invited to do that was Harry Styles). In addition, she’s got her podcast series, the weekly arts and culture newsletter Service95, and an upcoming Disney+ documentary series about Camden’s music scene, which she executive produced. But looming over everything is Dua’s return to Glastonbury. This time on the Pyramid Stage. “I think about it all the time,” she says. “Fifty per cent of my thoughts go to Glastonbury, then the rest are for everyday tasks.” Her journey to the top of the bill is a story of aspiration, setbacks and tenacity that goes right back to childhood. Dua was born in London in 1995, about three years after her parents, Dukagjin and Anesa, emigrated from Kosovo, having witnessed the beginnings of what would become the Balkan wars . A natural performer, Dua’s enthusiasm was thwarted by her primary school music teacher, who put her through a humiliating public audition in front of the whole school. “He started playing the piano and I’m trying to hit this high note, and nothing comes out. Literally just air,” she recalls. “Everyone in assembly laughed. I was so embarrassed. It was a big moment for me in my life.” Salvation came at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where the young Dua Lipa enrolled as a weekend student. There, she was taken under the wing of singing tutor Ray Lamb. Recognising that her voice skewed towards the lower end of the mezzo-soprano range, he instantly removed her from the junior choir and put her in with the teens. She was “mortified” to be singing next to children who were twice her height, but says Ray “helped me build my confidence”. “He was the toughest one, the scariest one, but really soft, deep down. And when he told you that you were good, you had a real sense of validation. He was the teacher that really made me feel I had something.” Dua Lipa: Headlining Glastonbury Watch the extended interview with Dua Lipa on BBC iPlayer (UK only). Encouraged, she started posting cover songs to YouTube (“I thought I’d get discovered like Justin Bieber”) until, all of a sudden, her parents decided to move back to Kosovo. Dua stuck it out for two years before persuading the family she should return to London. There, she shared a flat with a family friend, taking jobs in retail and modelling to pay her rent, while “trying to get school over with as quickly as possible”. Her first demos were released in 2012. A year later, after appearing in an X Factor commercial , she signed with Lana Del Rey's manager, Ben Mawson, who sent her for two years of intensive writing sessions. The results included early singles like Be The One and Hotter Than Hell; but it took a while for Dua to climb the rocky peaks of pop. Her debut album was delayed three times before New Rules lit a rocket underneath her career. Suddenly, she was learning her job in the full glare of the spotlight. Some of her early TV performances lacked polish, as the singer got used to juggling live vocals with camera angles and choreography. A stilted performance at a German festival spawned the ""go girl, give us nothing"" meme, which still stings to this day. ""It made me feel like maybe I wasn't good enough or I didn't deserve to be there, I wasn't cut out to be a musician. "" she told America’s National Public Radio in 2022 . These days, those early wobbles are a distant memory. Dua opened both the 2024 Grammy and the Brit Awards, with high-concept, acrobatic dance numbers that could have been lifted straight from a movie musical. Creating those performances counts as “some of the most rewarding work I have done with an artist in my career”, says her long-time choreographer Charm La’Donna. “I really admire Dua's work ethic and the grit she has to keep challenging herself as a performer. We have such a good time creating together that at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like work."" Dua says the title of her new album, Radical Optimism, is partly a reference to the uncertainty of her early days. “I thought it was so important, the idea of pushing through when things feel like they aren't going well. Because often, with hindsight, you can say, ‘This thing that really upset me, I can see from a different perspective now’.” It’s a mindset she brought to the album. Writing sessions actually began in 2021, as a way of staying productive when the pandemic put her Future Nostalgia tour on hold. “I knew the title that early,” she says. “I felt like I had to write myself into a good idea.” However, the early sessions were fruitless. The new sound she was searching for didn’t materialise until she finally hit the road in 2022. The thrill of playing her music with a live band inspired her to take the same approach in the studio. Programmed beats and loops were replaced by live drums, flamenco guitar and even, on a song called Maria, the sound of a Polynesian nose flute. She calls it “alternative but pop, with a touch of psychedelia”. Fans will hear 11 tight, summer holiday-ready pop bangers - and the ones who pay attention to the lyrics will notice a big shift in Dua’s perspective. Her first album was full of screw-you anthems, aimed at a cheating boyfriend. But the final song on Radical Optimism, Happy For You, finds her wishing an ex good luck with his new partner. “ Even the hard parts were all for the best ,” she sings over a swirling piano motif. “ I must have loved you more than I ever knew."" “That’s definitely a new emotion,” says the star. “""I used to be much more impulsive and reactive [but] not every break-up has to be a bad one.” Her writing feels more specific on this album. On Watcha Doing, Dua admits the damage her need for control causes in relationships; while These Walls is a Polaroid picture of a couple realising their time is up, that reaches Abba levels of domestic misery. It’s a corrective to critics who’ve sometimes described Dua’s work as anonymous or faceless. “As a pop artist, there's always the stigma of not being taken seriously,” she says. “Pop music makes you feel good, so it can't be deep, or honest, or real. “But it's a challenge I'm willing to take on: Putting the meaning back into pop.” It’s notable that Dua’s album arrives within weeks of headline releases by Ariana Grande, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, with new material from Billie Eilish due in May. In the past, they’d have been pitted against each other by a press hungry for drama. But not this time. “We’re definitely growing up,” says Dua. “People are being held accountable for the way they choose to portray women.” Setting up false rivalries “creates friction” and adds “pressure to a relationship that’s not yet fully formed”, she argues. That stifles artists’ ability to collaborate and support one another, and she’s thankful a corner has been turned. “We’re in a moment in time where there’s so much camaraderie and I think it’s working in our favour,” she says. “It’s amazing to see so many women putting out albums at the same time. And everyone is so different, with such different stories to tell, so why isn’t there room for everyone?” Glastonbury proves that there is. For the first time ever, the festival will have two female headliners – with Dua joined by US R&B phenomenon SZA. “I feel so lucky to be a part of that shift,” says Dua. “It’s important to have more female headliners. We’ve just got to keep applying the pressure and making that change happen.” The booking is effectively a coronation for the new queen of British pop – and Dua is determined to make it count. She casts her mind back to her first tour, when she’d invite the audience on stage for the encore of Blow Your Mind (Mwah), and wonders how that would work on the Pyramid Stage. “It might be tight,” she laughs. “But I’ve got to figure out a way to make 150,000 people feel like they’re in a small little nightclub. “That’s the goal, and if there’s one place to do it, it’s gotta be Glasto.” Let’s just hope she takes care of her tailbone this time.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4dlg2qvn8o,entertainment
209,Barnsley: 1960s Pollyanna designer Rita Britton returns to fashion,"An iconic fashion brand with its roots in the Yorkshire coalfields in the 1960s is to be revived by its founder a decade after it closed. Rita Britton opened her high couture Pollyanna boutique in Barnsley in 1967, but it shut when she retired in 2014 after a stroke and brain haemorrhage. Now in her 80s, Ms Britton said she had returned to designing and manufacturing fashion with a ""new passion"". Retirement ""drove her mad"" and she wanted to get back to work, she said. ""I realised you don't turn off creativity,"" Ms Britton added. ""You might decide to retire, but I looked at the people I admire who are older than me like David Hockney and Alan Bennett. Karl Lagerfeld worked into his 90s. ""Creativity does not suddenly end, it's there."" Ms Britton said she had not realised how famous Pollyanna was, and she initially steered away from the brand because it was such ""a name of its time"". ""When you work in the middle, you don't see it, you're in it, you enjoy it,"" she said. ""People all over the world have told me Pollyanna was so iconic."" Ms Britton said she felt she had to ""carry on and use"" the brand name. ""You gather so much knowledge about the industry you're working in and you think, I can't shelve that."" Ms Britton said she would choose to live in Barnsley over any other town or city in the world and she enjoyed teaching young people about working in fashion. Barnsley was ""such a creative place"", she said. ""You wouldn't believe the quality of the textile designers we deal with, absolutely incredible. It's a fabulous industry to be in."" She said that currently Pollyanna was producing a handbag with New York, Milan, Paris, London ""AND Barnsley"" all printed on it. ""We're not in fashion, we're into style - because style is lasting, fashion is fleeting."" ""I've come back with a new passion,"" she said.

210,Asante gold artefacts: Ghana rejoices as 'crown jewels' looted by British put on display,"Looted artefacts from the Asante kingdom are finally on display in Ghana, 150 years after British colonisers took them. Ghanaians flocked to the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of Asante region, to welcome the 32 items home. ""This is a day for Asante. A day for the Black African continent. The spirit we share is back,"" said Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II. At this stage the items have only been loaned to Ghana for three years. This loan can be extended, but only with the approval of the British culture secretary. The agreement is between two British museums - the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and British Museum - and the Asante king, not the Ghanaian government. The Asante king, or Asantehene, is seen as a symbol of traditional authority, and is believed to be invested with the spirits of his predecessors. But his kingdom is now part of Ghana's modern democracy. ""Our dignity is restored,"" Henry Amankwaatia, a retired police commissioner and proud Asante, told the BBC, over the hum of jubilant drumming. The V&A is lending 17 pieces while 15 are from the British Museum. The return of the artefacts coincides with the silver jubilee celebration of the Asantehene. Some of the items, described by some as ""Ghana's crown jewels"" were looted during the Anglo-Ashanti wars of the 19th Century, including the famous Sargrenti War of 1874. Other items like the gold harp (Sankuo) were given to a British diplomat in 1817. ""We acknowledge the very painful history surrounding the acquisition of these objects. A history tainted by the scars of imperial conflict and colonialism,"" said Dr Tristam Hunt, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who has travelled to Kumasi for the ceremony. Among the returned artefacts are the sword of state, gold peace pipe and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king. ""These treasures have borne witness to triumph and trials of the great kingdom and their return to Kumasi is testament to the power of cultural exchange and reconciliation"" said Dr Hunt. One of the returned items, the sword of state, also called the ""mpompomsuo sword"" holds great significance for the Asante people. It serves as a sword of office that is used in swearing the oath of office to the kingdom by paramount chiefs and the king himself. Royal historian Osei-Bonsu Safo-Kantanka told the BBC that when the items were taken from the Asante it took away ""a portion of our heart, our feeling, our whole being"". The return of the artefacts is as controversial as it is significant. Under UK law, national museums like the V&A and British Museum are banned from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin. Some countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership. Many Ghanaians feel the ornaments should remain permanently. However, this new arrangement is a way to overcome British legal restrictions. African countries have repeatedly called for the return of looted items with some regaining ownership over precious historical artefacts in recent years. In 2022 Germany gave back over 1,000 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria . The German foreign minister said at the time it was a step in dealing with a ""dark colonial history"".

211,"Martine Croxall, Annita McVeigh, Karin Giannone and Kasia Madera begin legal action against BBC","Four presenters have begun legal action against the BBC on grounds of sex and age discrimination and equal pay. Martine Croxall, Annita McVeigh, Karin Giannone and Kasia Madera are attending a two-day hearing for an employment tribunal against the corporation in central London. They claim they lost their roles on the BBC News Channel following a ""rigged"" recruitment exercise. The BBC insists its application process was ""rigorous and fair"". The corporation also rejects the claim on equal pay, insisting there is no claim to answer. In court documents, it said: ""It is denied that [the BBC] has subjected [the presenters] to age or sex discrimination, harassment or victimisation, or has breached the sex equality clause."" The two-day preliminary hearing, which started on Wednesday, is laying out the groundwork for a full tribunal against the corporation. The four newsreaders have all been presenters on the BBC's TV channels. In July 2022, the BBC announced proposals to merge its domestic and international news channels. The presenters claim that ahead of the announcement of the merger, the BBC's Channels' manager Jess Brammar privately assured four other chief presenters - two men and two younger women - their jobs were safe. ""We were put through a pre-determined job application process in February 2023,"" the presenters said in court documents. As a result, they said they were not recruited as chief presenters and were instead offered roles as correspondents, which was in effect a demotion and a reduction in pay. The presenters called the recruitment process ""a sham"" exercise, ""where our jobs were closed even though the redundancies were not genuine as the work still exists"". All four presenters also allege they have not been paid equally compared with an equivalent male presenter since February 2020. They have filed past equal pay claims, which they say is part of the reason the BBC treated them the way it did. ""The BBC grinds you down on pay,"" Croxall told the hearing. The BBC denied the pay complaints and said all candidates for the chief presenter role were subject to the same fair and objective application process, which involved an application interview then practical assessments. It said at least five other applicants scored more highly than the four women in the recruitment exercise and were appointed, based on what it called an ""objective assessment"". The case comes four years after a high-profile equal pay dispute between the BBC and presenter Samira Ahmed. In 2020, Ahmed won the employment tribunal she had brought against the corporation. She had claimed she was underpaid by £700,000 for hosting audience feedback show Newswatch, compared with Jeremy Vine's salary for Points of View. The BBC argued the two performed ""very different roles"". But the unanimous judgement said Ahmed's work was like that done by Vine, and that the BBC had failed to prove the pay gap wasn't because of sex discrimination. In 2021, the BBC revealed it had spent more than £1m on legal fees to fight equal pay and race discrimination cases brought by staff.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68927258,entertainment
212,Bookshop opens at 5am for local writers,"A bookshop in East Sussex has launched an early morning initiative to help writers. Kemptown Bookshop, in St George's Rd, Brighton, opens its doors at 05:00 BST on the first Wednesday of every month for a silent writing session. Owner Cathy Hayward said: “There's no workshopping, just the motivation of being around other writers as the sun comes up.” A writer who attends The 5am Writing Club said it was a “monthly landmark that keeps me on track”. Ms Hayward, who took over the shop in 2022, trialled the initiative last summer. She said writing in the early hours was her only “guaranteed peace” alongside looking after her three children. “Where better to write than a bookshop with a café, and when better than at 5am?” she said. “The local bakery usually delivers our pastries at about 07:00 to give you that extra energy boost.” The bookshop opens to the general public at 09:00, but Ms Hayward says the early writers are welcome to stay. “Although I’m also serving drinks, I use the time to write too and have written quite a bit of my next book in the 5am Writing Club,” she added. A writer who has attended the sessions said finding time had been difficult since having children. “Since having twin babies and juggling work and the ever increasing pile of washing, making space in my day to write is incredibly difficult,” she said. “But being able to head into the cosy, inspiring space of Kemptown Bookshop and be surrounded by other writers once a month while the world outside is still asleep is invaluable.” Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

213,STV journalists strike for second time,"Journalists at STV are taking strike action for a second time after the latest pay offer put forward by the broadcaster was rejected by staff. The strike on Wednesday will see programmes such as the News at Six bulletin and Scotland Tonight debate show pulled off air. Staff at the company previously went on strike in March, with the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) saying they were seeking a ""fair"" 6% pay rise, but a second strike planned for April was cancelled as talks continued. The channel said it was ""disappointed"" at the decision but alternative programming would air in place of news programmes. The strike will coincide with the broadcaster’s annual general meeting, where NUJ representatives, STUC representatives and individual staff will attend as shareholders. Nick McGowan-Lowe, the NUJ's national organiser for Scotland, said that STV had shown ""willingness"" to end the dispute, but that it was ""disappointing that once again our journalists are having to head out of the newsrooms and into the shareholder AGM to find out answers"". He added that they had been told by STV that a 6% pay increase - which the union says would keep pace with inflation - was ""unaffordable"". The union has argued that salaries for journalists at the company have fallen behind equivalent roles at the BBC and ITV, which runs the rest of the channel three network. The broadcaster's pay offer has been accepted by other staff at the company. However, the union said that the pay rise could easily be paid for via money that has been paid to chief executive Simon Pitts. Mr McGowan-Lowe said: “A tiny fraction of chief executive Simon Pitt’s bonus would be enough to resolve this dispute for all 90 of the newsroom’s staff – and still leave him paid vastly more than the director general of the BBC – an organisation that is over 45 times larger than STV.” An STV spokeswoman said the company had offered ""enhanced"" terms. She said:  ""We understand that almost half of NUJ members voted to accept the enhanced offer, which included a bonus payment for all STV staff. ""We remain open to further dialogue but the NUJ's claim for an above inflation pay increase of 6% - nearly twice the current level of inflation - is unrealistic and unaffordable."" The spokeswoman added that the company considered their offer ""fair and financially responsible"". The first one-day strike in the dispute saw newsroom staff form picket lines in Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow, while a separate demonstration at the Scottish Parliament attracted cross-party support. At the time, First Minister Humza Yousaf called on STV to return to talks with the union to reach a fair settlement. The second scheduled strike day, scheduled for Wednesday 16 April, was postponed after talks between the NUJ and management. Following further talks, a package of proposals was put to NUJ members. Unions once had huge power in commercial broadcasting. Until the 1980s, industrial action could leave screens blank and meant the broadcaster would lose advertising revenue. The strike by journalists at STV is not costing the company a single penny directly. Network programmes and advertising went out normally during the first strike in March - the same is likely to happen on Wednesday. Rules on the volume of advertising which only cover Channels 3, 4 and 5 mean that there are few commercials around the main news programme. So if the programme shown instead of the STV News at Six gets a relatively small audience it makes no difference to advertising revenue. But the union believes it has other powerful weapons. News is STV’s main legal obligation - it may lose money but it earns the company the right to broadcast on Channel 3. It also wins the company influence and respect. The union has chosen the day of the company’s annual general meeting for action purposefully. It hopes to highlight its members' concerns to shareholders and put pressure on management to make a further improvement to its pay offer.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmj6v1rg6g8o,entertainment

215,Inside the exquisite Tibetan monasteries salvaged from climate change,"Extreme weather is threatening these intricate 14th Century Tibetan monasteries, but local people are rising to the challenge to preserve them. Tashi Kunga stands before the Kag Choede monastery, built into the Dhaulagiri mountain range on the Tibet-Nepal border. The monk's carmine robes glint in the rain, as he recounts the ancient legend of Guru Rinpoche's battle with a demon. The legend goes that centuries ago, a demon wreaked havoc on a monastery in Tibet. Guru Rinpoche chased it south to Upper Mustang in Nepal and defeated the demon following a ferocious battle, burying the demon's remains across the mountain range. The people of Mustang honoured the sacred grounds by building monasteries atop the demon's body parts.  ""And right on the demon's heart, the capital of Lo Manthang [was built] in 1380,"" says Kunga, pointing towards the narrow alleys, ancient monasteries, and flat roofs adorned with prayer flags of one of the last medieval walled cities in the world. For centuries, Lobas, the indigenous people residing here, have thrived in this remote region situated on top of the Tibetan Plateau. One thing that has remained constant is the monasteries, locally known as ""Gonpas"", the most treasured heritage of the region. But almost two decades ago, many of these monasteries, which date back to the 14th Century, started crumbling. Experts sounded the alarm , attributing the collapse to the severe impacts of climate change. Data indicates a significant increase in the intensity of storms and rainfall across the region. Increased rainfall saturates the rammed-earth buildings, as moisture in the soil is drawn upward into the walls, leading to issues such as leaking roofs and rising damp. ""For us, Buddhists, the paintings and the artifacts in the monasteries are embodiments of the gods themselves, and we can't worship a half-damaged idol,"" says Kanga. ""There was no one to repair it. Our heritage was slowly decaying away. We thought the deities were angry."" Buddhist monasteries have long been revered as the foundation of Tibetan culture , serving as a vital hub for the creation and safeguarding of both tangible artifacts and profound intellectual traditions. But as unprecedented weather patterns pose a threat to their cultural heritage, local community members have stepped up to restore them. Local people have gained diverse skills, from reinforcing walls to crafting metal statues and restoring paintings. Over the past 20 years, a team of local Lobas trained by Western art conservationists have replaced the old, leaky roofs of the temples with round timbers, river stones, and local clay for waterproofing, and have restored the wall paintings, statues, sculpted pillars and the ceiling decorations, giving these centuries-old monuments a new life. Luigi Fiegni, the lead art conservator at Lo Manthang, has spearheaded the restoration project. Transforming a community of farmers into conservators has been challenging, he says. Most of the Lobas had never held a pen or a paint brush before, and undertook extensive training before they began restoring the 15th Century paintings. ""But it all worked out,"" says Fiegni. ""Tourists visiting Mustang were keenly interested in religion. So we felt these sacred artifacts needed preservation not only for their historical significance but also for sustaining livelihoods here."" The team, initially made up of 10 members, has grown to 45 conservators, mostly women, although there was initial reluctance to accept any women in the group. According to local tradition, women are prohibited from touching sacred objects. However, women did eventually take part in the Lo Manthang restoration project. ""It took years of discussion and negotiation with the local clergy and community, but we succeeded in including local women in the wall-painting conservation team,"" says Fiegni. Married Tibetan women are typically responsible for cooking, cleaning, milking the animals, churning the butter and collecting yak dung for fuel. Tashi Wangmo, 40, used to spend her time herding yak, collecting and selling herbs, and doing various odd jobs, but it never provided much income. When she received the opportunity to pursue new training and earn a daily wage in the restoration project, she jumped at it. ""It enabled many of us [women] to break free from the limits of our homes, expand our skillsets, and find new opportunities,"" she says. ""Otherwise, life remains stagnant for us, confined to the corners with little purpose or prospects."" Another female restorer Dolma Tsering, 42, wasn't there just to learn art or refine her painting skills. She believed that by participating in the monastery's restoration, she would earn spiritual merit and contribute to the promotion of Tibetan Buddhism through her work. ""Once you compare the faded, scraped-off outlines of deities and the vibrant expressions of revived figures, you will recognise the incredible scale of everyone's efforts. It has increased the cultural value of Lo Manthang,"" says Tsering. ""And as women, we were able to play [a role] in it."" But the community continues to face challenges amid the onslaught of climate change. The Himalayas are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and climate impacts. When rainfall comes, it pours in abundance, but prolonged drought is also common. In 2023, heavy rainfall flooded many small rivers and brooks in Mustang , leading to widespread flood damage in neighbouring villages. The roads facilitating easy transport in the region have also contributed to rapid population decline , with many Lobas moving to cities in search of economic opportunities, says Gurung. Tashi Gurung stands out as a prime example of a farmer-turned-restorer who chose to remain in the region. He wasn't exposed to Tibetan Buddhist art as a child, but today he owns an art gallery in Lo Manthang. His gallery showcases a remarkable array of thangkas, portraying the Buddha, his teachings, and various deities and other spiritual beings such as the bodhisattvas. His art sales not only sustain himself but also enable him to send his children to school. Reflecting on his decision to stay, Gurung acknowledges the profound impact of monasteries on his life. ""If it weren't for the monasteries, I might have followed my friends who left Mustang for better opportunities abroad,"" he says. The restoration efforts have sparked a cultural renaissance, according to Fiegni. Numerous women and young people have received training in traditional craftsmanship, long-forgotten festivals have been revived, magnificent wall paintings restored for religious purposes, and monasteries and nunneries are thriving once again, he says. ""Om mani padme hum,"" the students at the Lo Monastic School chant the mantra that Tibetans use to invoke the bodhisattva of compassion, who is also Tibet's patron saint. Today, Kunga says, the danger imperilling the walled city of Lo Manthang and its age-old monasteries doesn't stem from mythological demons, but rather from the impacts of climate change. ""If we want to save our culture, we all need to join hands and save the monasteries because everything here spins around religion,"" says Tsering. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

216,FKA Twigs uses AI to create deepfake of herself,"FKA Twigs has revealed she has used artificial intelligence to create a deepfake of herself that will interact with fans and journalists so she can focus on her music. The British singer, dancer and actress told a US Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday that celebrities and artists should have control over how their voices, looks and personalities are used by AI. ""In the past year, I have developed my own deepfake version of myself that is not only trained in my personality but that also can use my exact tone of voice to speak many languages,"" she said. ""These and similar technologies are highly valuable tools. This, however, is all under my control and I can grant or refuse consent in a way that is meaningful. ""What is not acceptable is when my art and my identity can simply be taken by a third party and exploited falsely for their own gain without my consent due to the absence of appropriate legislative control."" She added that her digital clone would be able to communicate in French, Korean and Japanese. ""It means that even with my upcoming album, I can really explain in depth what it's about creatively,"" she said. ""It also allows me to spend more time making art. Often being a music artist, or any artist in this day and age requires a lot of press and a lot of promo, a lot of one-liners. ""So it means if it's something simple that doesn't really require my heart, I can do a one-liner and give it to people to promote a piece of work and it's harmless, but ultimately I can spend more time making something that's really meaningful for my fans."" In further written evidence , she said her ""AI twigs"" would be deployed later this year ""to extend my reach and handle my online social media interactions, whilst I continue to focus on my art from the comfort and solace of my studio"". The star argued that other people shouldn't be allowed to use an artist's voice and other features without their consent, saying that creators' ""careers and livelihoods are in jeopardy"" if there is not legislation to regulate the use of AI. ""There are songs online - collaborations with myself and other artists - that I didn't make,"" she told the committee. ""It makes me feel vulnerable because, first of all, as an artist, the thing that I love about what I do is that I'm very precise. I take my time with things and I'm very proud of my work. ""So the fact that somebody could take my voice, change lyrics, change messaging, maybe work with an artist that I didn't want to work with, or maybe work with an artist that I wanted to work with and now the surprise is ruined - it really leaves me very raw and very vulnerable."" The use of AI to impersonate the voices and images of well-known singers and rappers has been growing. In early April, Jess Glynne, Mumford and Sons, Sam Smith and Zayn Malik were among the British artists who signed an international open letter calling for more protection against ""the predatory use of AI to steal artists' voices and likenesses"". On Wednesday, a group of UK MPs published a report suggesting that musicians and other celebrities should be protected by a law that would ban AI-generated deepfakes in the UK. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music said there should be legislation including ""a specific personality right to protect creators and artists from misappropriation and false endorsement"". Such a law should also include other measures to protect musicians from the risk of AI becoming ""a destroyer of creators' livelihoods"", the MPs said in a report published on Wednesday. Politicians must ""confront the danger that unfettered developments in AI could pose to the UK’s musicians and music businesses"", said the cross-party group's chair, Labour MP Kevin Brennan. But the power of AI can also be a force for good to ""help musicians to innovate and to inspire new human creativity"", he added. ""We ignore the necessity to sow policies, which will harvest the benefits of AI, and help stave off the threats it poses, at our peril,"" Mr Brennan said. ""Our central insight must always be that AI can be a great servant but would be a terrible master."" In response, a government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to helping artists and the creative industries work with the AI sector to harness the opportunities this technology provides, and ensure our music can continue to be enjoyed around the world. “Trust and transparency are vital to this shared approach. We are working closely with stakeholders and will provide a further update in due course.” The government has already pledged that the creation of sexually explicit deepfake images will be made a criminal offence in England and Wales.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6py33gxk74o,entertainment
217,"Kendrick Lamar escalates Drake feud on the scathing diss track, Euphoria","Kendrick Lamar has released a diss track attacking fellow rap star Drake, escalating their long-running feud. Called Euphoria, the song is a response to weeks of taunting by Drake, who has taken pot-shots at Lamar on a series of viral diss tracks. Over six minutes, Lamar calls Drake a ""manipulator and habitual liar"", and criticises his parenting skills. He also accuses the Canadian star of selling out, saying he only makes music to ""pacify"" fans. And he leaves listeners under no illusions about the strength of his feelings towards Drake. "" This ain't been 'bout critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest, "" he raps. "" It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater."" "" I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress. "" The rappers' feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. During a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had ""tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes"". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop. The feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year, when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the ""big three"" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter. The seemingly innocuous comment went unremarked for months. Then, in the middle of March, Lamar delivered a fiery verse on Like That, declaring that there was no ""big three - it's just big me"". In April, Drake released the first of two diss tracks, titled Push Ups, in which he mocked Lamar's height as well as his collaborations with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift. Later that month, Drake dropped another song, Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he taunted Lamar, calling him a coward for failing to respond. The track controversially used AI technology to imitate the voices of Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur - one of Lamar's heroes. After a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram . Lamar's Euphoria similarly criticises the use of AI, saying it would ""make [Tu]pac turn in his grave"". He also asks ""Am I battlin' ghost or AI?"" - a reference to the accusation that Drake has used ghostwriters in the past. Lamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: "" Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that. "" A former Pulitzer Prize winner for his fourth album, Damn, Lamar uses the song to display the dexterity of his voice, switching between flows and rhythmic meters throughout. He even appears to be mimicking Drake's Toronto accent in the closing bars. However, fans who were hoping for a slam-dunk conclusion to the rap beef were disappointed. Lamar conceded: ""I like Drake with with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough,"" and declined to respond to Drake naming his wife on a previous song. "" We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way, "" he rapped. The rift has drawn in several other rappers over the last few months, with stars such as Kanye West, The Weeknd and Rick Ross releasing songs that reference the fall-out. Drake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You , where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's ""bad boy"" character. It's presumably intended as a parody of Lamar's lyrics - but Drake seems to have forgotten how the scene ends. ""I hate the way I don't hate you,"" says Stiles, choking back tears. ""Not even close, not even a little bit.""",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68934613,entertainment
218,US author Paul Auster dies aged 77,"US author Paul Auster, who wrote the New York Trilogy mystery novels, has died at the age of 77. Auster wrote more than 30 books across his career and gained cult status in the 1980s and 90s. His novels were often existentialist stories about outsiders, and were particularly successful in Europe. The writer died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn due to complications from lung cancer, his friend and fellow author Jacki Lyden confirmed. In March 2023, Auster's wife, author Siri Hustvedt, announced he had been diagnosed with cancer. The son of Jewish Polish immigrants, Auster grew up in Newark, New Jersey, later moving to New York to attend Columbia University. After graduating, he spent four years in France, where he honed his craft as a writer. The sudden death of his father prompted Auster to write 1982's The Invention of Solitude, a haunting reflection on father-son relationships, which became a recurring theme. But his breakthrough came with The New York Trilogy, a philosophical twist on the detective genre centred on a shady quartet of private investigators named Blue, Brown, Black and White. His subsequent novels included Timbuktu and existential capers Moon Palace, The Music of Chance and Leviathan. Auster was praised for his sharp dialogue, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages. In addition, Auster wrote the screenplay for 1995's Smoke, a film about a Brooklyn tobacco shop, starring Harvey Keitel, which won the writer an Independent Spirit Award. He also co-directed the follow-up, Blue in the Face, which starred Keitel again. In 2017, Auster published 866-page novel 4321, which charted US society through the life of an everyman, Archie Ferguson. The author was said to have considered it his masterwork, although it received mixed reviews from critics. Last year, Auster published Bloodbath Nation along with his photographer son-in-law Spencer Ostrander, which focused on gun violence in America. Auster's text was accompanied by Ostrander's black-and-white pictures from the sites of 30 mass shootings. In recent years, Auster's own life was struck by tragedy, with his 10-month-old granddaughter Ruby dying after ingesting heroin and his son Daniel, the child's father, dying of an overdose 10 months later. Prior to his death, Daniel had been found guilty of negligent homicide. Auster never publicly discussed their deaths.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn3de800ykko,entertainment
219,"Aysgarth: Ex-youth hostel filled with 120,000 books put on sale","A former youth hostel filled with more than 120,000 books has been put up for sale. The 30-room property in Aysgarth, North Yorkshire, is home to bookseller Richard Axe, 73, who has spent 18 years amassing the mammoth collection. However, due to ""various health issues"" he said he was looking for a buyer to take on both the building and books. On the market for £1.5m, Mr Axe said it was ""regrettably too much"" for him to manage. He told BBC Look North: ""I would love to stay here, but it's just too much and I can't manage such an enormous stock and such an enormous building. ""When I bought this place and had it restored to a state such that it could accommodate these books, I then employed somebody for a year to do almost nothing but building shelves, and this is why there are over a mile of shelves."" Brian Lake, who founded Jarndyce Antiquarian Booksellers, described Mr Axe's collection as ""unique"". He said: ""I can't think of anywhere else in the country which has that quantity of books - it's something that couldn't be repeated."" The property includes the hostel, which dates back to 1878, and a two-bedroom cottage where Mr Axe has lived since 2006, and a large garden overlooking the historic St Andrew's Church. The famous Aysgarth Falls are also located nearby, along with the River Ure and the market town of Leyburn is seven miles to the east. Mr Axe said his library did not attract a lot of visits from members of the public but was visited by a number of specialist international booksellers, with one recent buyer leaving with a bag of historic letters that were then sold on to the British Library.

220,Actor Damian Lewis tunes up for 'biggest' gig,"The TV and stage actor Damian Lewis has revealed he had already booked tickets for camping at Latitude Festival when he was later asked to perform. The 53-year-old and his band have been announced for the Second Stage at the festival in Henham Park near Halesworth, Suffolk, on 25-28 July. He will join Duran Duran, Kasabian, London Grammar, Keane and Rick Astley in the line-up. Lewis said Latitude would be his ""biggest"" gig and he was ""really excited"". ""I was already booked to come and camp here with my kids and then I got asked to come and play,"" said Lewis, whose TV credits include the US series Billions and Band of Brothers. ""It's a huge privilege, I feel really grateful. ""We're on the Second Stage, which is a big stage. ""There are potentially going to be up to 8,000 people there, that's the biggest gig I will have played, so I'm really excited."" Lewis said music had ""always been in the background"". ""I used to hop on my motorbike and go around Europe and busk in the summers when I was starting out as an actor,"" he said. ""We've been putting bands together for wrap parties and things at the end of films, TV shows, that sort of thing. ""I was approached... I was singing on the radio, something a few years back, and got approached - 'would you be interested in doing something?'""

In an interview with The Guardian in 2022, Lewis described his band's debut album , Mission Creep, as a ""rootsy, jazzy, rock’n’rolly, singer-songwritery-type"" record. Latitude director Melvin Benn said he almost felt like he was watching Bruce Springsteen when he saw Lewis the musician on stage. ""It was like can he actually play?"" Mr Benn told BBC Radio Suffolk.

221,Crooked House owners win right to postpone inquiry,"A public inquiry to decide whether the owners of the Crooked House should rebuild  ""Britain's wonkiest inn"" has been postponed after a request by the owners. The pub, in Himley, near Dudley, was destroyed last year in a suspected arson attack. South Staffordshire Council served an enforcement order on the owners in February, ordering them to rebuild the pub within three years. However, ATE Farms Limited launched an appeal against the order in March and the council has now said the inquiry was likely to take place in spring 2025 instead of August 2024. The notice was served to ATE Farms Limited as well as its director George Adam Taylor, and former director Carly Taylor, who stepped down in December. According to the council, the planning inspectorate accepted ATE Farms's request to postpone the inquiry and said it would be preferable to deal with the appeal following any potential separate court action relating to the fire. However, the inspector noted that the inquiry should not be delayed indefinitely and indicated that it would be arranged for some time in spring 2025. Meanwhile, an architect, Steve Anderson, said drone footage from 2016 was a ""gift"" and ""it's an amazing opportunity to do a really good job of recreating The Crooked House"". Jim Morris, from Drone Surveying, stated he set up the business in that year, was testing out a new drone and ""scanned the pub with the landlord's permission at the time"". Director Mr Anderson, from Buttress Architects, said: ""It means that we can produce really good information to help a builder to put that building back together very accurately, very faithfully."" He also stated: ""This kind of data is incredibly accurate and it's down to the millimetre, so we can take that data, convert it into a set of really detailed drawings that would help a builder."" The Crooked House was well-known in the Black Country for its sloping walls and floor, caused by mining subsidence in the area. The pub caught fire on 5 August and was demolished two days later, prompting anger from residents, former customers, and the region's politicians. ATE Farms Limited bought the 18th Century pub from Marstons in July 2023, nine days before the fire. Five men and one woman have been arrested in connection with the fire, which the force is treating as arson, Staffordshire Police have said previously. A woman, 34, and two men, aged 23 and 44, all from Leicestershire, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent or being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Three other men, aged 66, 51 and 33, had been held on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. All have been released on conditional bail.

222,Co-op Live to meet trust behind ticket tax idea,"Bosses of the UK's largest indoor arena are to meet the charity behind calls for a £1 ticket tax on major shows to support grassroots venues. Mark Davyd of the Music Venue Trust said the meeting with Co-op Live would happen once the delay-hit arena was up and running. Fans recently spotted a £1 donation had been factored into the ticket price for Billie Eilish's show next year. The money will go to a US-based project and and was not levied by Co-op Live. Mr Davyd said the irony of the added £1 donation ""was not lost"" on the trust given Co-Op Live's now-departed general manager previously dismissed the idea . Mr Davyd said Eilish's ""excellent initiative"" showed there is ""leeway"" in the price of tickets for major shows to include a donation to ""go back into the live music ecosystem"". ""This is an important piece of work, but we need to see it on every show the Co-op Live doing and every ticket they sell,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester . The charity he founded has argued a compulsory £1 per ticket levy for gigs with a capacity above 5,000 people would help support the next generation of musicians by boosting struggling local venues . Mr Davyd said the trust would ""very strongly"" push the proposal at a meeting promised by Co-op Live once the 23,500-seater venue is operational. Writer and former DJ at the Hacienda Dave Haslam said smaller venues were an ""important part of the fabric of towns and cities"". ""There will be more closures if action isn't taken"", he added. ""A major arena could be anywhere, whereas smaller venues are very much part of what makes a city, they are part of excitement, part of the psyche of the city and we need ways to support them financially."" The writer said the £1 donation in Eilish's tickets shows a ""levy is possible"". ""If they can do that for an artist, why not the local music infrastructure."" Co-op Live representatives have previously said the venue was working on local initiatives to support grassroots music and would donate £1m to the Co-op Foundation charity to support a range of causes.

223,Five 'incredible' British museums nominated for arts prize,"Museums in Skipton, Dundee, Manchester and London will compete for the 2024 Museum of the Year award. Three of this year's five shortlisted museums have undergone major renovations, only reopening in the last 18 months. The shortlisted institutions cover museums spanning portraits, natural history, science, textiles, fine art and children's creativity spaces. The winner, announced on 10 July, will receive £120,000, while £15,000 will be given to each of the other four finalists. Described as the world's largest museum prize, the shortlist for Museum of the Year was announced by Art Fund, the UK's national charity for art. The prize recognises projects open to the public from autumn 2022 through to winter 2023. Organisers say they particularly focus on community engagement, sustainable ways of working and reinvention when selecting the shortlist. Speaking on behalf of the judges, Jenny Waldman, the director of Art Fund, described the shortlist as ""shining examples of the impact museums are making locally and nationally"". ""Each of our finalists truly has something for everyone and all have community at the very heart of their programming,"" she said. ""Their commitment to innovative partnerships whilst operating within an extremely challenging funding environment is incredible, and I'm so pleased to see the way they support and centre young people through their work."" The shortlisted museums are: The Craven Museum is embedded in Skipton Town Hall's cultural hub, and covers archaeology, textiles, fine art, literature and social history from pre-history to the present day. With two art galleries, a two-screen cinema, a print studio and learning programme, Dundee Contemporary Arts is one of Scotland's most prestigious arts organisations. The 130-year-old Manchester Museum reopened in February 2023 following an extensive renovation, and is home to around 4.5 million objects from natural sciences and human cultures. Six centuries of portraiture are encompassed at the National Portrait Gallery, which reopened in June 2023 following a major three-year transformation project. Formerly known as the V&A Museum of Childhood, the Young V&A was created with and for children and young people with the intention of encouraging creativity with spaces to imagine, play and design.

Modern Art Oxford wants to raise the final £25,000 of a £2m figure to revamp its ground and lower ground floors. The gallery said the building was ""stretched to its limits"" and the Victorian infrastructure could not meet demand. Director Paul Hobson said his team was ""so close"" to realising their ""transformational vision"" for the site. He said if the campaign through Art Happens was successful it could ""fully equip and furnish"" its public spaces ""to enable the best possible welcome and creative offer for our diverse communities"". The plans consist of a refurbished entrance, a social area with a digital display for housing interactive commissions and archive material, a new gallery for exhibitions celebrating Oxford’s creative community, a dedicated studio space, and a new cafe designed by artist Emma Hart. Rewards available to campaign donors include artist-designed merchandise by Ms Hart and Harold Offeh, an afternoon in the cafe, an invitation to the opening of the new spaces, a private art-making workshop in the studio space, and a London contemporary art tour with Mr Hobson. The gallery has been working on the new designs with David Kohn Architects. Modern Art Oxford first opened in 1965 and has hosted exhibitions by Agnes Martin, Robert Mapplethorpe, Yayoi Kusama, Marina Abramovic, Yoko Ono, Tracey Emin, and Jenny Saville.

225,Vinted makes first profit on used fashion,"Vinted has made a profit for the first time as the fashion for second-hand clothes remains on trend. It was a firm ""at the forefront of a market with huge potential"", its chief executive said. Digital platforms allowing customers to sell their ""pre-loved"" items direct to other people have taken off in recent years. But Vinted, which has expanded rapidly across Europe, is the first out of the red, turning a €20.4m (£17.4m) loss in 2022 into a €17.8m profit. Thomas Plantenga, Vinted's chief executive, said second-hand fashion remained a ""tiny"" proportion of the market but that the firm was in a strong position. As well as expanding into new markets, including Denmark, Finland and Romania, Vinted had also accelerated the development of its delivery service Vinted Go, he said. “We see many opportunities ahead, so we’ll continue to balance profitability against investment opportunities to accelerate towards our mission,” Mr Plantenga said. He added that enabling customers to sell to each other would help ""mitigate the harm of the fashion industry"". Vinted said revenues had jumped 61% to €596.3m (£509m) in 2023 compared with the previous year. The marketplace acquired a second-hand designer clothes specialist platform, Rebelle in 2022 and has launched a service which verifies the authenticity of valuable items. Vinted and a similar UK-based platform Depop have both caught on with British shoppers in recent years, eating into eBay's original dominance of the second-hand clothing market, and appealing particularly to younger shoppers. The cost-of-living crisis, combined with increased awareness of fashion's environmental impact, have helped bolster the trend. Social media influencers and celebrities have also helped to overhaul associations with musty, out-of-fashion, charity shop stock. A recent report from US-based second-hand retailer ThredUp suggests that the market for used fashion is now worth tens of billions of dollars a year in Asia, North America and Europe. However the size of the new clothes market, and the trend towards lower quality ""fast fashion"" products, mean it is hard for second-hand platforms to make a profit. ""In recent years, the likes of Vinted and Depop have ploughed millions into growing their headcount and expanding their audience, as they looked to capitalise on the second-hand trend,"" said retail analyst Natalie Berg. ""It’s a gamble that seems to have paid off for Vinted. With low prices and no seller fees, its model needs scale which, in turn, will open up alternative revenue streams like advertising."" Vinted, a privately owned firm, said it had expanded its staff by a third. It now has 2,000 employees, most of them in Lithuania.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxwvp2z7djyo,entertainment
226,Love Island: Sanam Harrinanan and Kai Fagan announce engagement,"Two Love Island winners have announced that they've got engaged. Sanam Harrinanan and Kai Fagan, both 25, were voted best couple on the ITV reality dating show in March 2023. They first coupled up at Casa Amor - the notorious section of the show where boys and girls are split between two villas and tempted away from their current partner. But they won't be recoupling now and, in true Love Islander fashion, the pair announced the news on Instagram. Kai posted photos of the couple on a riverboat in Cambridge, taken on Saturday, that showed the happy moment. ""Introducing the next Mrs Fagan,"" he wrote. ""Beautiful, caring, loving and smart are just some of the words that describe you. ""I love loving you, I love you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you."" Fellow islanders including Tasha Ghouri, Indiyah Polak and Toby Aromolaran were quick to offer their congratulations. Sanam and Kai appeared on the winter version of Love Island, filmed in South Africa, and won the £50,000 cash prize last year with 44% of the public's votes. They beat fellow couples Lana Jenkins and Ron Hall, and Samie Elishi and Tom Clare. They were among the first Love Islanders to appear on the show after a new social media ban introduced by ITV as part of its duty of care policy. The series has faced falling viewing figures in recent years - just over a million people watched the All Stars reboot finale in February, down from a peak of 6 million in 2019. Sanam posted on TikTok after the announcement saying she ""honestly had no idea"" Kai was planning to propose on Saturday. ""I am so chuffed and happy,"" she said. ""I feel like the luckiest girl alive."" Marking their one-year anniversary as a couple last month, Kai said it had been the best year of his life. ""Can't wait to see what the next 12 months is going to be like,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Hopefully Sanam proposes and we have 6 kids... but time will tell..."" Sanam and Kai aren't the first Love Islanders to go the distance. In 2018, series two runners up Olivia Buckland and Alex Bowen tied the knot and series five favourites Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury announced their engagement last summer. Both couples also have children together, as do Jamie Jewitt and Camilla Thurlow, who met on the show in 2017 and married four years later.

227,Sadler's Wells: Shortlist announced for new dance prize,"Sadler's Wells theatre has launched a global dance award which organisers hope will raise the industry's profile. The first shortlist of entries includes acts from Brazil, France and the US, and features several different genres. In early 2025, the nominated works will be performed across venues around London over a two-week period. Sadler's Wells CEO Sir Alistair Spalding hopes the award will ""do for dance what the Turner Prize has done for visual arts"". While the film, art, literary and theatre industries have several awards ceremonies, the dance industry does not have as many which cut through with the general public. Organisers hope that will change with the introduction of the inaugural Sadler's Wells prize, which is split into two categories. The Rose will recognise established choreographers presenting a full-length performance of 50 minutes, while the Bloom is for emerging choreographers with a maximum of 10 years' experience - and will be awarded every two years. The prize money for the Rose is £40,000, while the winners of the Bloom will receive £15,000. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One on Monday, also International Dance Day, Sir Alistair explained a donor had approached him asking to fund the prize. He continued: ""We are bringing all these artists to London, that's one of the main things, that people can actually see the work. They will all come to London in January 2025... it's a very generous gift."" Choreographer Akram Khan said Sadler's Wells decision to launch the prize was ""extremely important"". He told presenter Sarah Montague: ""It's going to be such a varied audience, and that's what's really exciting."" ""Usually when dance is celebrated, usually it's because of the dancer or he production, but what's interesting here is it's celebrating the choreographers."" The shortlist was decided by a panel or 14 nominators, made up of presenters, artists, producers and writers from North America, South America, Africa, Europe, East Asia, South East Asia and Australasia. When the prize was first announced, Sir Alistair said: ""Prizes like the Booker, Oliviers, and Turner have all managed to attract media and public attention, which raise the profile of the art forms they feature. He said the intention was to create a ""similar prize"" for dance, ""which does not currently exist at a scale or stature of these industry-defining prizes"".

228,Billie Eilish tour dates announced for new album Hit Me Hard and Soft,"Billie Eilish has announced an 81-date world tour starting later this year. The What Was I Made For singer confirmed dates in North America, Australia and Europe from September. Billie previously told music website Billboard her latest tour would be her most sustainable yet and she's partnered with an environmental group to organise it. Tickets for the tour - named after upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft - go on sale on 3 May. Billie will start in Canada on 29 September before taking her show to the US in October. She'll then head to Australia in February, arriving in Europe next April. The Oscar-winning singer has 12 UK dates, including two shows in Glasgow, six in London and four in Manchester. Billie is a long-standing climate campaigner and she committed to making her last tour in 2022 ""climate positive"", meaning it would eliminate more emissions than it produced. She partnered with Reverb, a non-profit organisation that works to promote sustainability in the music industry, and will be working with them again on this tour. Initiatives include reducing single-use plastics, offering plant-based food options and donating a portion of profits to funding climate projects. In an interview earlier this month, Billie told Billboard she and her team were doing everything they could ""to minimise waste in every aspect of my music"". ""My parents have always kept me well informed and hyper-aware that every choice we make and every action we take has an impact somewhere or on someone, good or bad, and that has always stuck with me,"" she said. ""I can't just ignore what I know and go about my business and career and not do something. That's just not how I was raised, or how I want to live my life."" For Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is set to be released on 17 May, Billie's also announced plans to limit the impact of physical copies. This includes making vinyl copies out of recycled vinyl with the packaging and album sleeves also made from recycled materials. The singer has announced she would not be releasing any singles in advance, saying she wants fans to hear the album ""in one go"". The tour announcement came days after Billie revealed she'd followed in Lady Gaga's footsteps and been added to the line-up of Fortnite Festival - the rhythm-based game within the popular online shooter.

229,Blue Ivy Carter joins mum Beyoncé in Lion King prequel,"Beyoncé and Jay-Z's daughter Blue Ivy Carter has joined the voice cast of The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King. Blue Ivy, 12, voices Kiara, daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala, played by her mother. Beyoncé is reprising the role from Jon Favreau's 2019 photorealistic remake of the animated 1994 original. The new film, directed by Moonlight filmmaker Barry Jenkins, will explore Mufasa's origin story and his childhood with brother Scar. Like the 2019 movie, it will also combine live-action filmmaking techniques with photoreal computer-generated imagery. Jenkins told US breakfast show Good Morning America that Blue Ivy was ""professional"", while Beyoncé was a ""mum first"" on set. ""They just approached it that they both wanted to perform and do the best they could. And yet, they didn't have to pretend very much because they really are mother and daughter."" The first teaser trailer for the film also aired on the programme. A voiceover says Mufasa was born ""without a drop of nobility in his blood"" but ""would change our lives forever"". Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr will voice the younger versions of Mufasa and Scar, respectively in the new movie. The 2019 Lion King film, featured the voices of Donald Glover as Simba, Beyoncé as Nala and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. Glover will reprise his role in Jenkins's prequel. The cast also includes Mads Mikkelsen and Thandiwe Newton, with Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner also returning. The movie will feature original songs by Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who has also penned songs for films including Mary Poppins Returns and Encanto. While this is Blue Ivy's debut film role, she has performed previously as a dancer on her mum's live tour. Blue Ivy is the eldest daughter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z. The couple also share twins Rumi and Sir, six. Her casting will no doubt relight the debate about so-called nepo babies. The term refers to suggestions of nepotism when a young person follows in their famous parents' footsteps. Mufasa: The Lion King is due to be released in the UK in December this year.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6py92nellqo,entertainment
230,Does The Jinx: Part Two mark the end of an era for true crime?,"With the jaw-dropping climax of its first series in 2015, The Jinx kickstarted a spate of high-profile true crime shows that included Making a Murderer. Following a backlash against the way these shows glamorise crime and show a lack of respect for victims, could Part Two mark a turning point for the genre? As TV endings go, they don't come much more jaw-dropping than the finale to the first series of HBO true-crime documentary series The Jinx. After six episodes that interrogated US real-estate heir Robert Durst's connection to the mysterious disappearance of his first wife, along with two brutal murders, the season ended with Durst – not realising his mic was still on – heading to the bathroom and uttering to himself the now infamous line ""Killed them all, of course"" – seemingly confessing to the murders of his first wife, his best friend and a former neighbour. You couldn't have scripted it any better. The day before the bombshell episode aired in March 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans while on the run (having watched the penultimate episode, in which his handwriting is revealed to match that on a vital piece of evidence – the famous cadaver note – he sensed he was in trouble). He was charged with the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman and in 2021 was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Soon afterwards Durst was also charged with the murder of his wife Kathie, who disappeared in 1982 without trace, but Durst – worth a reported $100 million – died from cardiac arrest in January 2022 before the case could go to trial. Durst's death appeared to mark the end of a four-decade saga that had baffled and frustrated detectives, fascinated reporters and – thanks to The Jinx – gripped the public. Andrew Jarecki's Emmy-winning doc series, rather than merely covering the story, became an integral part of it, thanks to Durst's shock confession – which the producers didn't even realise they had on tape for two years . The show – along with the success of the podcast Serial, which aired in late 2014 – helped usher in a new era of glossy true-crime shows including Making a Murderer and Tiger King , with TV networks rushing to satisfy demand, turning real-life tragedy into entertainment and raising some ethical questions in the process. Nothing could ever quite hope to top that ending of The Jinx, which remains an unparalleled moment in documentary television. Unlike Making a Murderer and Tiger King, which rushed out second seasons after the success of their first, The Jinx seemed happy to remain a one-off true-crime phenomenon. Until now. Nine years later, it's back with a six-part follow-up. The Jinx Part Two looks at what happened after that hot-mic-drop moment: the reaction to the show, a new investigation, the trial, and how Durst was finally brought to justice. The first episode – which shows the moment some of the victims' friends and family, and others involved in the case, saw that famous episode for the first time – feels a little like the show giving itself a congratulatory pat on the back. Can you really blame it, though? Director Andrew Jarecki's connection to Durst goes back nearly 20 years. His 2010 movie, All Good Things, starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst, was a fictionalised version of Durst's life, specifically dealing with the unsolved disappearance of his wife Kathie. Amazingly, Durst liked the film and contacted Jarecki offering to be interviewed. As documentary subjects go, Jarecki describes Durst as ""kind of a unicorn … he's such a powerful personality and also reckless and also willing to be honest about things that most people aren't honest about… There's so much to him, and he's a troublemaker and kind of a firestorm. That draws people in. It's very seductive."" Durst was the eldest son of New York City real estate magnate Seymour Durst. His mother died by suicide when he was a child – Durst said he watched her jump from a window, though his brother denies this happened . Estranged from his family, Durst was known for his eccentric personality, something he made no attempt to hide on camera. ""He's not a likeable guy. I mean, he murdered three people,"" says Lisa DePaulo, a journalist who began covering the story in 2000 after Susan Berman's murder, and appeared as a witness in Durst's trial . ""But his character is so unusual. You can't stop watching him."" Uncomfortable viewing DePaulo captures an uncomfortable truth about Durst – that, for all his horrific crimes, he made for fantastic TV. ""He was so riveting because you never knew what was going to come out of his mouth,"" she tells the BBC. ""And Jarecki got Durst, he knew that he was entertaining."" Over the years Durst has been the subject of SNL sketches , the punchline on late-night talk shows and even a question on quiz show Jeopardy. John Lewin, LA deputy district attorney and the lead prosecutor in Durst's case, admits in The Jinx: Part Two: ""I'd be lying if I said I didn't find Bob funny. Just because you're a murderer, doesn't mean you can't be charming."" But, he adds, ""I made sure our case was not going to live or die on whether people found Bob appealing."" Aside from his personality, the series captures how Durst's privileged background impacted him. Reflecting on Durst's bizarre behaviour in the original series of The Jinx, New York Times crime reporter Charles Bagli said: ""The guy is crying out to be arrested, isn't he? On the other hand, he's also a guy who walks through life and thinks he can do whatever he wants to do. And most of the time he could."" DePaulo agrees that Bob had an undeniable sense of entitlement. ""I think he thought, 'I'm Bob Durst, I can do whatever I want.' And I think there was part of him that wanted to get caught… and when he did get caught, he thought he would beat the system. He did think he was on a different level."" Durst's apparent confidence that nothing or nobody could touch him was perhaps one of the reasons he contacted Andrew Jarecki in the first place. Jarecki has said he thinks Durst was carrying around a burden of guilt and had ""a compulsion to confess"" – though even he didn't expect that to happen in quite such a literal or dramatic fashion. Would Durst ever have faced justice if The Jinx hadn't been made? DePaolo doesn't think so. ""I do believe that The Jinx is why he had to face the music,"" she says. ""After the trial, I said to [lead prosecutor] Lewin: 'You did a marvellous job. Everybody's families are so grateful.' And he said: 'Well, the person they should be grateful to is Andrew Jarecki, because he's the reason we got him convicted."" (Lewin is being modest – his skilful cross-examinations are one of the most compelling parts of the new episodes.) Yet for all it achieved, The Jinx wasn't without its controversies. There was confusion over the timeline of events (three years passed between Durst sitting down for that fateful interview and when the final episode aired) and questions over when Jarecki and his team handed over vital evidence to the police. Court documents suggested that the infamous confession was edited and played out of sequence . More like this:  The Jinx returns at a time when true crime is facing something of a reckoning. In the nine years since the show first aired, the genre's popularity has grown enormously – but so has scrutiny over our relationship to it. Whether it's the ethical issues of treating crimes as entertainment, the rise of amateur TikTok detectives (including, recently, people trying to uncover the real-life identities of characters in Netflix drama Baby Reindeer), issues of racial bias (most true crime shows focus on white, often female, victims) and even alleged use of AI imagery , there's been a growing sense of unease over our seemingly insatiable thirst for true-crime stories. One frequent criticism is that the victims are often sidelined to focus on the perpetrator. ""There's a reason why the victims are often ignored in true crime, and that's often because the victim's families really don't want to be involved, which is understandable,"" says Dr George Larke-Walsh , senior lecturer at the University of Sunderland and author of True Crime in American Media. ""But it does mean that there's this bias towards the perpetrator and that is what makes the ethics of true crime debatable."" DePaulo – who knows some of the friends and family of Durst's victims – believes they were largely on board with The Jinx. ""Everybody was glad [Jarecki] was doing it. They thought, maybe he'll come up with something we don't know, and he sure did."" The Jinx was focusing on exposing a suspect, though – while many of the other big true-crime shows of recent years, including Making A Murderer (which the family of victim Teresa Halbach called "" one-sided ""), have focused on potential miscarriages of justice or flawed cases, following in the footsteps of Errol Morris's 1998 film The Thin Blue Line. The gory details of cold cases are dredged up and pored over by millions of strangers, who all have an opinion on what happened. The Staircase – which later became a TV drama starring Colin Firth – was criticised for focusing on Michael Peterson as the victim instead of his dead wife, Kathleen. As true crime has continued to grow in popularity, streaming networks have raced to keep up with demand, churning out bingeable series of wildly varying quality where the focus can sometimes be more on entertainment than truth. Larke-Walsh says that, when done carefully, true crime can educate people on important issues. ""I'm a big defender of true crime and think that it can have a social purpose,"" she says. ""I do think it's important for people to be able to see the justice system at work. However, filmmakers have an ethical responsibility to approach these topics with the seriousness and respect that they deserve. When you make a documentary, there's a tacit agreement between filmmaker and audiences that what you're making represents the truth or a truth, even if you can't get to a definitive truth,"" says Larke-Walsh. Portraying events as honestly as possibly, while still making shows that satisfy viewers – and TV networks – is the line that documentary makers have to tread. ""The desire to make true-crime shows gripping is totally understandable,"" says Larke-Walsh. ""What people need to remember is that a documentary is still a narrative. They're still creating a story and they're still creating characters. You can't knock documentary filmmakers for doing that because you need to create audience engagement. But it's finding that balance."" There are certainly plenty of characters in the new season of The Jinx – even if Jarecki is now reliant on audio and video recordings of Durst from jail, rather than his own interviews. New faces include two law clerk brothers who work for the prosecution (""the wonder twins"") and, most notably, Durst's friend Nick Chavin, who would later testify against him but who, when interviewed for the show, seems remarkably blasé about his friend's misdemeanours. ""I don't have that same moral hatred of murder and murderers,"" he shrugs. Indeed, much of this new season is focused on the people who helped Durst get away with his crimes for so long. Jarecki told Vanity Fair he was intrigued by ""the idea that there's this constellation of people who all see themselves as good, decent people… and yet here they are helping a murderer."" There are a few crass moments in the new season – a reenactment of Bob fleeing for Cuba on a boat in a latex mask (his plan if he hadn't had been caught), and some unnecessarily on-the-nose music cues. They feel like attempts to try and gee up the drama – not that this story needs it. Anyone hoping for a bombshell revelation like last season is likely to be disappointed though. Only four episodes of The Jinx Part Two were made available to journalists to watch in advance, with the final two being held back, but it's hard to imagine there will be anything even nearly as explosive as last time to reveal. No-one, not even Jarecki himself, could top that, surely? Instead, this season of The Jinx feels more like a fable on what happens when the legal system comes up against someone with huge amounts of money, power and privilege – and plenty of hangers on prepared to stick by them, motivated by either money or fear. It's a scenario that feels ever relevant in our world – even if Durst himself is no longer in it. ""I'm not sure we're going to find another Bob Durst,"" Jarecki has said . No matter how compelling a character he might have been, considering the horrors he carried out, we should be grateful for that. -- The Jinx: Part Two is streaming in the US on HBO on Sundays, and in the UK on Sky on Mondays.

231,Real life Baby Reindeer victims urged to speak out,"This article includes plot details of the Netflix series Baby Reindeer Male stalking victims are being urged to report offences following the success of the television show Baby Reindeer. The hit Netflix dark comedy, which has topped the streaming services charts in the UK and US, depicts the true story of a stalker who harasses comedian Donny, played by series writer Richard Gadd. Kent Police said there was 346 reports of stalking in the county in the past month, of which 75 were made by men. Det Ch Supt Emma Banks said: “Men don’t expect to be stalked and it’s not so widely reported on, which is why Baby Reindeer was such a good programme to shine a light on that very important area.” Baby Reindeer started life as a one-man stage show written by Mr Gadd, which he performed at the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The television series depicts Mr Gadd's own experience of having a stalker in real life. Ms Banks, head of Kent Police’s protecting vulnerable people command, said men are less likely to report being stalked over fears of not being taken seriously. “Stalking can have a devastating impact. I think anyone who has watched Baby Reindeer can see that,” she told BBC Radio Kent . “The victim in the programme didn’t get a brilliant response from the police, but I can assure people out there that you will get a much more positive response.” She added that men often take longer to report stalking, which can mean evidential opportunities may be lost. Mr Gadd recently asked fans to stop speculating about the real-life identities of its characters. Fans began to speculate about the identity of the stalker, as well as that of a male TV writer who is depicted in the series as raping Mr Gadd's character. Steps were taken to prevent identification, including by using pseudonyms for the names of the characters, but some real-life figures have notified police after viewers linked them with the programme.

232,"Labour must rebuild trust with Muslim voters, says senior MP","Labour's deputy campaign coordinator says her party needs to rebuild trust with Muslim voters, amid an apparent backlash over its stance on Gaza. The party's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections. Labour's Ellie Reeves admitted it had ""a lot of work to do"" to rebuild support before the general election. She added this included ensuring voters ""understand our position"". In 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one-in-five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested. It was a downside to an otherwise positive performance for Labour, which saw it gain more than 170 councillors to take control of eight councils. The potential impact on a general election is unclear, however, with some evidence the biggest drops in support are largely confined to areas where the party's support was already very strong. And there are signs that any adverse reaction was less prominent in London, where incumbent Labour mayor Sadiq Khan called for a ceasefire before the party leadership did. Labour's vote is up by three points on average in parts of London where more than 15% identify as Muslim, compared with 4.5% where the proportion is less than this. Labour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position. Its initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year. The decline in its vote share in areas with a big Muslim population appears to have been largely to the benefit of independent candidates standing in those areas. Ali Milani, chair of Labour Muslim Network, said Labour's positioning on Gaza ""is going to have a serious electoral consequence"". ""If I was a Labour MP in Bradford or Birmingham or Leicester or parts of London or Manchester I would be seriously concerned,"" he added. The Greens, who called for an ""immediate ceasefire"" just over a week after the war began , have also increased their share of the vote from 2021. Co-leader Carla Denyer said Labour's stance on the conflict had been the ""final straw"" for some Labour supporters who were already disappointed by policy U-turns in other areas. ""I have met many voters on doorsteps who brought it up proactively as an issue,"" she added. She also said ""part of the Muslim community switching their votes"" was also a factor in Newcastle, where the Greens gained their first-ever seats on the city council. On Sunday, recently re-elected Worthing Councillor and Momentum co-chair Hilary Schan resigned from Labour in order to support pro-Palestinian candidates from other parties - and she has joined journalist Owen Jones's We Deserve Better campaign. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Saturday, Ellie Reeves said: ""We know that we've got a great deal of work to do to rebuild trust with Muslim communities. ""I understand people's concerns about what's happening in Gaza. The loss of life there has been intolerable - that's why we have called an immediate ceasefire"". She added that ""a lot of listening needs to be done,"" and the party also needed to make sure voters ""understand our position"". Labour's national election co-ordinator Pat McFadden echoed her, telling the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the situation in the Middle East was a ""high foreign policy priority"" for Labour, if it was elected. ""The better lives that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares,"" he said. He acknowledged that in some parts of the country, the conflict was proving a problem for Labour and said: ""There will be some people who maybe voted Labour in the past who haven't in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we'll work to get people's support back."" In the West Midlands mayoral race, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on Gaza, won over 69,000 votes. In Blackburn with Darwen, Labour lost council seats to independent candidates who quit the party over the leadership's Gaza stance. It also faced a surge from pro-Palestinian independents in Bradford, where the Labour council leader said Gaza had been a ""big issue"". The local party leader in Oldham said the conflict was a factor there, where Labour lost overall control of the council , but also blamed a wider unhappiness with ""mainstream parties"". George Galloway's strongly pro-Palestinian Workers Party of Britain won four seats - two in Rochdale, one in Calderdale and one in Manchester, where they ousted the Labour deputy leader of the council Luthfur Rahman. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-05-05,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68956784,politics
233,Israel-Gaza war: 'My children cling to me as dogs raid Rafah graves near our shelter',"The children hear the dogs snarling outside, just beyond the flimsy plastic of the tent. The seven children of Rehab Abu Daqqa crowd around their mother. She is the last safe harbour in their lives. They have shared things, these children and their mother, which cannot be communicated to those who have not seen the things they have seen. Is there a word to express what a child feels knowing that just a few yards away, animals are dragging a body from a grave? The vocabulary of childhood is inadequate amid the horrors of this emergency cemetery in Rafah. Scared is the word Rehab Abu Daqqa uses. WARNING: This report contains descriptions some readers may find disturbing That is accurate. But there is more to it, she knows. The children have seen dogs eating the bodies. A human leg lying by a fence. So yes they are scared. But revolted too, and uncomprehending. The children who once had a home, went to school, lived according to the established rhythms of their family and community, are now refugees in a place that reeks of death. ""This morning the dogs took out a body from one of the graves and were eating it,"" Rehab Abu Daqqa says. ""From night until dawn the dogs do not let us sleep… our children keep holding on to me because of how scared they are."" The dogs come in packs of dozens. Domestic pets whose owners are dead or displaced, mixed with Rafah's existing population of strays, all of them now feral and scavenging for whatever they can eat. The cemetery has numerous shallow graves where people place their dead until a time comes when they can be taken to their home area. On some graves relatives have placed bricks to try to keep the dogs away from the dead. Rehab Abu Daqqa is gaunt and exhausted. Her mouth and nose are covered by cloth to fend off the stench of the graves. She praises the young men who came earlier to reinter a body dragged out that morning. ""I don't accept that me or my children should live next to a cemetery. My child is in the 3rd grade and today instead of playing a game he was drawing a grave and in the middle he drew a dead body. These are the children of Palestine… What can I tell you? Miserable, the word miserable doesn't even explain it."" The cemetery is one of several in Gaza that has become a refuge for people whose homes have been destroyed in the fighting. There are more than 1.4 million people crowded into Rafah - five times its pre-war population. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council that works out at 22,000 people for every square kilometre. Already disease is spreading, with outbreaks of diarrhoea, hepatitis A, and meningitis - as well as a continuing hunger crisis. Rafah is where the refugees of Gaza reach the final wall, the border with Egypt which is closed to the overwhelming majority of the displaced. They arrive after being pushed from one place to another by the advance of the Israeli forces. Rehab Abu Daqqa has fled three times already and may soon have to uproot her family again if the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) offensive on Rafah goes ahead. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said a military operation in Rafah will go ahead ""with or without"" a ceasefire to destroy what he says are four Hamas battalions in the city. Hamas insists there can be no deal without a commitment to permanently end the war. Far right members of the Israeli coalition cabinet are warning Mr Netanyahu against compromise. The Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a standard bearer for the settler movement, has called for ""absolute destruction"" in Rafah, saying there can be no ""half work"". ""Where do they [refugees] move to? "" asks Dr Rik Peeperkorn, regional director of the World Health Organization (WHO), who recently returned from Rafah. ""We already have a crisis in health. We have a water and sanitation crisis, a food crisis. There's a humanitarian disaster. So, there'll be just another humanitarian disaster on top of this… What we expect will be substantial additional mortality and sickness when a military incursion happens. So, a lot more people dying… a lot more death and a lot more diseases."" Dr Peeperkorn worked for seven years in Afghanistan with the UN and is not a man who is easily daunted. But when we met in Jerusalem he looked tired. The tiredness of a man who wakes every morning to the certainty of a crisis that seems to threaten ever worse consequences. The WHO is already preparing for additional field hospitals to help if people are forced to move. But what happens to the seriously ill and the elderly, the 700 kidney dialysis patients who are currently being treated in a facility which once used to cater to 50? ""If you look at our health sector, it is crippled already and an incursion will actually mean that we lose another three hospitals… like they cannot be reached, they might be damaged, they might be partially destroyed. We are preparing for it with a contingency plan which is like a band aid."" My BBC colleagues have provided graphic evidence of the conditions inside hospitals, filming day after day throughout the war. At the European Hospital in Rafah families are camped in any space they can find, in the grounds and inside. They prepare meals in wards. Their children roam along the darkened corridors, past the wounded being wheeled on trollies, an old woman sitting on her own staring into the distance. In the emergency care ward, 11-year-old Yassin al Ghalban is crying on his bed. His legs are gone, amputated below the knee after an air strike. A relative standing by the bed says, ""he is surviving on painkillers"". At the cemetery, Rehab Abu Daqqa watches her children play a few yards from the graves. The dogs are gone but the children keep close to their mother. Soon she will be on the move again because she cannot bear for her children to stay in this place. There is no talk of hope here. Hope in Gaza departs at different speeds according to your circumstances. It can vanish in a second with the killing of a loved one. Or it can depart incrementally, hour after hour, as you are pushed from one squalid camp to another, and words fail as the questions from the children pile up.

234,Richard Parker vows to rebuild trust with Muslim voters,"Newly elected West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker has said he is committed to rebuilding the Labour Party's trust with Muslim communities. Mr Parker defeated Tory incumbent Andy Street, who had held the office for seven years and was seeking a third term, by just 1,508 votes, in a shock loss for the Conservatives. However, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket, won 69,621 votes, diminishing Labour's lead in some of its typical stronghold areas. BBC analysis has shown Labour's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections this week. In 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than 1 in 5 residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested. Speaking on BBC Politics Midlands after his electoral win, Richard Parker addressed voters' concerns about Gaza. ""It's a very important point and it matters to this region,"" he said. ""I've been out speaking and listening to many of our inner city communities, including the Muslim community. ""I understand their concerns, I understand how important this issue is to them and I'm committed to working with our council leaders, our councillors, our MPs in the region and with the Labour Party nationally to start to rebuild the trust we've lost with the Muslim community. ""I'm hoping if we do that and we demonstrate to them we do care and we understand their concerns, we can rebuild that trust and we can win them back to Labour."" Labour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position. Its initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year. Speaking in Birmingham after Mr Parker's win, Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed Labour voters who turned away from the party over its stance on Gaza. ""I say directly to those who may have voted Labour in the past, but felt on this occasion they couldn't, that across the West Midlands we are a proud and diverse community,""  Mr Starmer said. ""I have heard you, I have listened, and I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future."" Labour's campaign chief and Wolverhampton MP Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: ""I understand why people have got strong feelings about this issue, thousands of people have been killed. ""There’s a great impulse to help people that are in a terrible situation, that’s something that we share. ""The better life that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares. If we’re fortunate enough to be elected at the general election, its a very high foreign policy priority for the Labour Party. ""Two things have guided us since 7 October last year, the first was defending Israel’s right to defend itself after that atrocity and that remains part of our position and the second is working to get a better future for the Palestinian people, both of those things will guide our position going forward."" When asked whether the party’s stance on the issue will have an impact in a general election, he replied: ""I do acknowledge that in some parts of the country that was the case and there will be some people who may have voted Labour in the past that haven’t in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we’ll work to get people’s support back. ""Overall I do have to stress, these were tremendous local election results, a tremendous by-election and a set of Mayoral elections that went beyond the expectations that we had."" On BBC Politics Midlands, Mr Parker also discussed the mayoral results and what it meant for Labour in the next general election. ""It was an emotional rollercoaster. I'd actually only written a losing speech,"" the new mayor said. ""I had a great platform for my campaign and that was provided by the great work the Labour Party have done under Keir Starmer's leadership. ""What I think my victory demonstrated is that if we continue to work hard, campaign on issues that are important to working people, the Labour Party is in a great place to win the next election.""

235,Inside a 'peaceful and proud' Gaza protest camp at a UK university,"On a quiet morning outside Newcastle University, a small group of students listen to a lecturer talk about the opening song from Aladdin. Specifically, this line: “It’s barbaric, but hey! It’s home.” She’s telling the group about Edward Said, and how his work looking at the way Middle Eastern cultures had been depicted in the West could be applied even to Disney films. The talk then turns to how Said's theories could be applied to the portrayal of Palestinians in Western media. While this scene doesn't sound out of the ordinary, this isn’t your usual university seminar. This lecturer was giving her talk in the middle of an encampment, which university students set up on Wednesday to protest against the war in Gaza. Here in Newcastle, about 40 students have set up camp on the university’s quadrangle, with tents for sleeping, a makeshift first-aid centre, and tables for all the snacks donated by supporters - including crisps, water, and a Colin the Caterpillar cake. Students themselves do coursework or exam revision on the grass, or slip off for seminars and lectures, as they would if it were student halls. Several staff members come in to show their support and drop off donations of snacks. All of those I speak to tell me they feel “proud” to see their students taking part. Running along the perimeter are hand-painted signs. Naomi, who’s asked that we don’t use her full name, shows me a sign that she’d painted the night before. “It says ‘Tzedek, Tzedek, Tirdof’,” she tells me. “It means ‘justice, justice, shall you seek’.” Naomi says the sign - written in Hebrew - reflects how her Jewish faith has shaped her view of the conflict in Gaza. “I was always raised with a very strong sense of justice, because of my Jewish community,” she explains, adding that the sign “encompasses so much of what my Judaism means to me”. “In many ways, if I hadn’t been Jewish, I wouldn’t feel so firmly in solidarity with Palestine, because of the sense of social justice that my faith gives me.” Newcastle students are just one of many student bodies across the country to set up similar occupied protests this week . Similar outdoor camps have been erected on campuses including at Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield, while a camp outside Warwick University has been in place for 10 days. At Goldsmiths, University of London, students have occupied the library, inside the university building. Earlier this week the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) released a statement saying campus protests in support of Gaza were creating a “hostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students”. Guy Dabby-Joory, from the UJS, told me they knew there were Jewish supporters of the movement, but that they’d heard a lot of concerns from members. These UK protests have sprung up amid the backdrop of much larger demonstrations and occupations on campuses across the US - most prominently at Columbia University, New York, and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Those protests have seen more than 2,000 people detained over the past fortnight. While the calmness of the Newcastle camp feels a million miles away from those scenes, those who are taking part tell me that their counterparts in the US have seen what they’re doing, and have been in touch. “We’ve had some people from Columbia message us,” Frank, another student protester, tells me. Frank’s pronouns are they/them, and they asked that we not use their real name. “They just wanted to send us their solidarity - and that is really warming to see.” They say the group behind the occupation - Newcastle Apartheid Off Campus - had been organising in support of Gaza for several months, and that the occupation was planned before the recent disorder kicked off in the US. But the occupation was partly organised now to say to US students: “You’re not alone.” Students in the UK share some common goals with their US counterparts - in particular, the call for their universities to sever financial and research ties with Israel, a process known as divestment. But as well as this, Frank tells me they feel an emotional connection to students in Gaza - who, in better times, are no different to them. “There are tens of thousands of students in Gaza, and their lives are completely upended. There's no way you can pursue an education when you've got bombs raining down on you,” Frank said. “We’re sat in a peaceful university, studying, and they don’t have that opportunity.” Although it’s quiet now, rallies that are held at 5pm daily attract hundreds of other students. Frank estimates there were around 200 people at the last one. I ask one of the staff members - Dr Jemima Repo, a reader in political and feminist theory - whether she worries at all about the camp becoming disruptive during exam season. “No, not at all,” she says. The camp itself, while on the campus and visible, is set apart from walkways and entrances. “As far as I understand the relationship between campus security and police has been very good,” Dr Repo says, adding that there haven’t been any tensions among staff, either. The university, meanwhile, says it “respects the right to peaceful protests and freedom of speech” and that they are “engaging with protesters”. “Our priority is always to ensure that our campus remains safe for everyone and protests should be within the law - we do not tolerate the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour that causes, or is likely to cause, distress,” it said in a statement this week. Risk assessors also come by the camp while I’m there to make sure things are still peaceful, and that there aren’t any health and safety issues. Lecturer Dr Mori Ram also comes to chat to students and show his support. He’s originally from Israel, and has family near the border with Lebanon. The 7 October attacks by Hamas, and the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the months since, have deeply affected him. “To be honest, for the first time, I feel shame. My family is there… everything that happens there, they are exposed,” Dr Ram says. “I do think that encampments like this, and what's happening right now in the US, may provide the necessary political pressure on the Israeli government to hopefully bring things to an end, in a good way.” But Dr Mori says he knows he’s “not a representative of the majority of Israelis” with his views on the conflict. Mr Dabby-Joory, from the UJS, said that ""Jewish students, like all student communities, are broad and diverse, and there are a range of views in the Jewish student community"". “But I think many Jewish students are feeling unwelcome, uncomfortable and on edge,"" he said. “That doesn’t mean that every student is feeling it, but we know from speaking to so many of our 9,000 students across the country that so many of them are feeling those things while on campus.” The tensions within the community, and between others from her faith and those from her political groups, have affected Naomi too. “It’s incredibly isolating,” she tells me. “One of the slogans that’s often used [by Jewish pro-Palestinian activists] is ‘not in my name’. And I think, well, why should it be in anyone's name. “It's also been an incredibly isolating experience to see the reaction to pro-Palestinian activism by other Jewish people, personally and in the wider world. “It's been quite difficult at times to feel that sense of community, which has been such a big part of my upbringing.”",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0v8d805ypo,politics
236,US campus protests: 'Student arrests will be my final college memory',"In January 2020, they were seniors in high school. Graduation was just around the corner. But so was a deadly pandemic. By mid-March, Covid had upended daily life and many students were forced to spend their final months of school at home. Proms were cancelled. Four years later, those same students are now in college about to graduate. And once again, they face a similar souring of what would normally be a festive occasion. Pro-Palestinian protests have erupted at over 130 college campuses across the US, as organisers demand their universities cut ties from companies linked to Israel. They've set up vast encampments in the middle of university grounds and defied multiple warnings to disperse, sparking police raids and over 2,000 arrests. Three seniors explain how they're dealing with this tumultuous ending of their academic careers - for the second time. Madison Morris, 22, University of Texas The day the state troopers came in, that was also the day I had my last final exam. When I got to campus, they were already there and were closing in on students. The tension was super high. I had never been that close to so many police before. It was scary. I didn't really study for my exam later that day - I couldn't focus. All I kept thinking about was what I had just seen. I doubt I did as well on the exam as I wanted. My last day of class was the day I saw protesters - my fellow students - who were peacefully gathered on the main lawn, getting dragged away by police and arrested. That's something that's going to be ingrained in my memory forever. Those are going to be the memories of my final moments in college. It's hard to even feel happy right now while seeing all the negative stuff that's happening. I feel like I can't even really celebrate my accomplishments, because I'm just so overwhelmed. Graduation is next week. I had been looking forward to it for the last four years, because I didn't get to have a real one in high school. Because of Covid, we had to wear masks and there was social distancing. It wasn't the same. I was really hoping for a traditional graduation this year. I have been trying to make the most of my senior year and really just take it all in, but it's hard when stuff like this is going on. Like Covid, honestly, it all feels super dystopian. Craig Birckhead-Morton, 21, Yale University I was one of the 48 students arrested on 22 April. I woke up in the encampment at 6:30 to warnings from our safety marshals that we're being surrounded by the police. They told us to get up and prepare for arrest. I went to class the same day. It's been a very difficult time - a whole new level of stress. I have two final papers due. I have an Arabic project due. And I'm still behind on it because of everything that's going on. Senior year is extremely important, considering my family in all of this. They want to see me graduate. It's been a major concern of mine. We still haven't heard how the university plans to respond. And in many ways that's scarier than our actual legal charges. We might not be allowed to walk at graduation. We might not receive our diplomas or final transcripts. For me, the transcript is critical. I need it to matriculate into the master's programme I was accepted into at Columbia. Personally, I feel that all this knowledge I'm acquiring at Yale needs to go to a just cause. That's why I felt it necessary to hold the line on this. The situation in Palestine is unacceptable. I remember the first week of March during my senior year of high school. We were sent home and things were made remote. We didn't know that would be the end, but it was. No prom, no graduation. The pandemic was a major disruptor, but so were the Black Lives Matter protests. That was also a crucial part of the end of my high school experience and something that led me into organising and where I am today. Melissa Manesh, 21, University of Southern California This is supposed to be a happy time, the last few days on campus we'll ever have as students. And now it's being taken over by protesters. There's so much chaos happening. It's frustrating. The protesters are ruining student life. Libraries aren't being open at a time when most people are trying to study for final exams. There are helicopters flying around. Only two entrances are open to campus, which forces some of us to walk extra-long distances. Protesters are also blocking a huge area on campus and making it feel unsafe to walk through. I know for the Jewish students, a lot of us are scared. They'll shout at you. They'll call you a genocide supporter. We don't want to see these protesters and their signs that are extremely offensive. It heightens the stress of having to study. It's hard not to think about this when it's all happening right in front of you. It's extremely distracting. If you had told me that graduation was going to be cancelled, I wouldn't have believed you. When we found out, we were all really distraught and upset. This was supposed to be one of the biggest moments of our academic careers - one that we've all been waiting for - and now it's gone. I was also the class of 2020 for high school, and we didn't have a graduation then because of Covid. This feels really similar, and it's so sad and so upsetting. But now it feels much deeper and much more personal. It's not every graduating senior in the world this time that's losing their ceremony. It's just every graduating senior at USC.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68946501,politics
237,Israel-Gaza war: Ceasefire talks intensify in Cairo,"Efforts have intensified to secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, with talks resuming in Cairo on Saturday. Hamas said its delegation was travelling in a ""positive spirit"" after studying the latest truce proposal. ""We are determined to secure an agreement in a way that fulfils Palestinians' demands,"" it said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""taking the ceasefire should be a no-brainer"" for the militant group. Hamas's negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks - brokered by Egypt and Qatar - that would temporarily pause Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. In a statement released last night, Hamas said it wanted to ""mature"" the agreement on the table, which suggests there are areas where the two sides still disagree. The main issue appears to involve whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. Hamas is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel is reluctant to agree while the group remains active in Gaza. It's thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted there will be a fresh military ground operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, even if a deal is agreed. Israeli media reported on Saturday that his position remained unchanged despite the latest round of talks. But the US - Israel's biggest diplomatic and military ally - is reluctant to back a new offensive that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip. Addressing the prospects of a truce on Saturday, minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said: ""An official response to the outline has not yet been received. When accepted - the war management cabinet will meet and discuss it. Until then, I suggest to the 'political sources' and all decision-makers to wait for official updates, to act calmly and not to get into hysteria for political reasons."" The Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Williams Burns, has travelled to Cairo to help broker the latest talks, according to two US officials who spoke to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News. Mr Blinken has also been a key figure in the negotiations, and visited Israel again this week to meet Mr Netanyahu. Speaking on Friday in Arizona, Mr Blinken said ""the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire was Hamas"". So far, ceasefire talks have continued for months without a breakthrough. There hasn't been a pause in fighting or a release of hostages since the end of November. There have been moments in that time where a new agreement has seemed imminent, but a deal has fallen apart before it could be signed. Even in this latest round of discussions, caution is needed. A source familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations remained complex, and any breakthrough could still take several days. A source told the Washington Post that the US had urged Qatar to expel Hamas's political leadership, if the group continued to reject a ceasefire. On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Democracy Square in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages. Relatives of the hostages also gathered at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv to urge the government to make a deal. Some accused Mr Netanyahu of trying to undermine a proposed truce, and others called for an end to the war. Ayala Metzger, daughter-in-law of 80-year-old hostage Yoram, said the government must agree to end the war if that is the price for the release of the hostages. The war began after Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups attacked villages and military bases in southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. During the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, 34,654 Palestinians have been killed and 77,908 wounded, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68956549,politics
238,Pro-Palestinian protests heap pressure on Biden from left and right,"An outburst of pro-Palestinian protests and clashes with law enforcement on US college campuses has dominated headlines, and started conversations among diplomats scrambling to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East. It puts US President Joe Biden in a new kind of domestic political bind. He is caught between a left flank that is demanding peace, and Americans concerned that the unrest is disrupting university education and posing a threat to civil order. A message scrawled on a tent at a refugee camp in Rafah, the beleaguered southern Gaza Strip city, captured exactly how far word of recent US campus protests has travelled. “Thank you students for Columbia,” it read. “Thank you. Thank You. Thank you.” Other tents had similar messages of gratitude and solidarity, captured in video and photographs by American journalists on the scene. Over the past several weeks, police have arrested more than 2,000 protesters on dozens of college campuses across the US. Late Tuesday night at the University of California Los Angeles, a masked pro-Israeli group assaulted a pro-Palestinian student protest camp , before officers were called to the campus. Classes were cancelled. On Thursday, California police cleared the pro-Palestinian encampment. A similar scene played out at Columbia University, as New York City police in riot gear forcibly removed protesters who had barricaded themselves into an academic building and cleared that college's pro-Palestinian camp. The unrest comes at a tense moment in the Gaza War. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) appear to be preparing for a massive military operation in Rafah, a refuge for more than a million civilians. The Israelis have said it is the last redoubt of Hamas forces. Meanwhile, the US is pushing the Israelis and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire that would last weeks and include the release of some Hamas-held Israeli hostages, an increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the return of Palestinians to the northern part of the territory, where the Israeli incursion began months ago. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently concluded his seventh trip to the region since the start of hostilities, meeting with Arab leaders and the Israelis in a last-ditch attempt to forestall a Rafah operation that observers say is likely to cause a humanitarian disaster. At a State Department briefing on Thursday, spokesman Matt Miller said that the Israelis had made significant concessions in recent negotiations – agreeing to conditions that Hamas had said were necessary to reach a deal. “Every day that goes by without a ceasefire right now is on Hamas,” he said. “They are the ones that are holding up an answer to this proposal, and they are the ones that are holding up an immediate ceasefire.” On Friday, a Hamas leader said the group was reviewing the latest proposal in a “positive spirit”, and a delegation was sent to Cairo for ceasefire talks on Saturday. Any sign of progress will be welcome news for a Biden administration that is coming under increasing pressure to stop – at least temporarily – the civilian bloodshed and suffering in Gaza. In his press briefing, Mr Miller was dismissive of the impact of American campus protests on US efforts, but he acknowledged that it was difficult to avoid US media coverage of the unrest even overseas, and that the topic came up in conversation during Mr Blinken’s Middle East trip. Official American dismissiveness aside, the political pressure on Biden because of these protests is growing. For months, the president has been resisting calls from factions within the Democratic left to back away from his vocal support for Israel. He’s done this despite clear political risk, as more liberal voters – particularly the young and people of colour, who make up a key part of his electoral coalition – have grown increasingly critical of what they view as a policy that is tolerant, if not supportive, of aggressive Israeli actions in Gaza. Polls show Mr Biden is in a tough fight for re-election in November, where even a slight softening of support in battleground states could be the difference between victory and another four years of Donald Trump in the White House. “Because of the razor-thin margins in some places like Wisconsin and Michigan that are going to be pivotal in the election, I think it creates more potential for the Gaza War to matter,” says Jessica Weeks, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, which has been the site of pro-Palestinian encampments and subsequent police arrests. At least so far, that seems to be a risk Mr Biden is willing to take. Vocal objections about the administration’s support of Israel from the president’s left flank have been a recurring theme in the months since Israel’s invasion began. What’s new – and potentially more complicating – is the pressure now coming from right and centre, as campus unrest has dominated the headlines. Republicans, sensing vulnerability, have gone on the attack, claiming Biden is unable to maintain law and order and is turning a blind eye to antisemitism. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called protesters “raging lunatics and Hamas sympathisers” at a Wisconsin rally on Wednesday night. “I say remove the encampments immediately, vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students who want a safe place from which to learn,” he said. The following morning, after several nights of police crackdown on demonstrators, Mr Biden made a hastily scheduled appearance at the White House to condemn what he said was the lawlessness of some protests  – including vandalism, trespassing and disruption of university activities. “We are a civil society, and order must prevail,” he said. US elections have not traditionally been decided on issues of foreign policy unless American soldiers are dying overseas, but issues of law and order and domestic tranquillity can be more salient – particularly to the kind of middle-class American voters who live in college towns or send their children to prestigious universities. It could explain why Mr Biden, in his Thursday remarks, defended American free speech rights but spent most of his time warning protesters of the consequences of their actions. When the president finished his prepared remarks and turned to leave the room, a reporter asked if the protests had made him reconsider any of his Mideast policies. The president’s one-word answer: No. It may not be that easy. “Certainly it would not be politically wise for the president to say that he is making decisions that affect US national security based on the opinions of 19-year-old students,” says Ms Weeks. There is no mistaking the political realities of Mr Biden’s situation, however – and the possibility of escalation if ceasefire talks crumble and a bloody Israeli campaign in Rafah begins. With college graduation season approaching, a new round of highly visible protests could be on the horizon. In two weeks, the president is scheduled to speak at Atlanta’s Morehouse College, a historically black university where administrators are already expressing concern about campus security. And in August, Democrats will gather in Chicago for their party convention to formally renominate Mr Biden for the presidency – which could become a national focal point of intense protests not seen since the 1968 Democrat convention in the same city during the height of the Vietnam War. A ceasefire may buy the Biden White House some breathing room. But it may take the kind of permanent peace that has proven so elusive to remove the Gaza War as a potent political threat to the president.",2024-05-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2le9yzd1p2o,politics
239,Sweden prepares for Eurovision with heightened security,"Security is being tightened for the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden's third city Malmo, with large demonstrations planned to coincide with the event and the country already on high alert. Police and organisers say they're well-prepared and hoping for a ""joyful"" event. The annual feel-good celebration of pop and showbiz is this year shrouded by complaints from some quarters over Israel's participation amid the war in Gaza. Sweden was already facing heightened security challenges, and Malmo is expecting one of the country's biggest ever policing efforts. As many as 100,000 visitors are set to descend on this city on Sweden's south-west coast for the world's largest live music contest. Colourful Eurovision banners decorate many of the city's streets, and it's the third time that Malmo is playing host, after Swedish artist Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, with her hit song Tattoo. A programme of festivities kicks off on Saturday, with semi-finals next Tuesday and Thursday, culminating in the grand final on 11 May. An estimated 200 million viewers worldwide are expected to tune in for the four-hour spectacle. Forces have been drafted in from across Sweden, with reinforcements from neighbouring Denmark and Norway. Swedish police are usually armed, but some officers will carry larger weapons as a precautionary measure. Malmo police chief Petra Stenkula said the whole country was already ""on a terror level of four out of five"". ""I think it's obvious that the world's insecurity has also affected Eurovision,"" she told the BBC. ""In Sweden, and Malmo in particular, there have been protests against Israel taking part in the competition."" The police chief said there were no specific threats to the event, but the alert level was raised last August, following a spate of Quran-burnings that angered the Muslim world. An internal police report, highlighted by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT , described Sweden as a ""priority target"" for violent jihadist groups. The 23-page threat assessment for Eurovision also cited unrest, cyber attacks and disruption of the broadcast as other potential risks. ""In Sweden, police are used to working with very complex issues, and we think we have good planning,"" said Petra Stenkula. Cameras have also been set up and drones are being used for surveillance. Guests will also have to pass through airport-style security controls including scanners and searches, when entering venues and no bags are allowed. ""It's a huge thing for the city of Malmo. So, of course, it's important that everything works smoothly,"" said Per-Erik Ebbestahl, Malmo's security director. ""We feel very well prepared."" Authorities have been planning for months and also working with their counterparts in Liverpool, which hosted last year's competition. ""It's been very, very, helpful for us,"" he told the BBC. Malmo has hosted the Pope and also a Holocaust Remembrance conference two years ago. But the city's security director says what is new is the general threat towards Sweden and large gatherings. ""It's not aimed at Eurovision per se,"" he said, pointing out that similar security had been in place for recent ice hockey playoffs, and was also planned for this month's Taylor Swift concerts in Stockholm. Fencing had been erected and additional cameras were being mounted when the BBC visited the Malmo Arena on Thursday. Inside the venue, rehearsals were already under way for a show featuring 37 acts. ""We have really exciting shows coming up,"" said Ebba Adielsson, SVT's executive Eurovision producer. ""We know the debate out there, we know about the demonstrations and we are well prepared. We hear it and we respect it,"" she said. ""But I sincerely hope that it doesn't overshadow it that much. Israeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, and her song Hurricane will undoubtedly be in the spotlight. Originally titled October Rain, the song had alluded to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel last 7 October. Israel's public broadcaster agreed to modify the lyrics, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is responsible for the contest, gave the song the green light. About 1,200 people were killed in Israel and 253 others taken hostage during the Hamas attacks. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then by Israeli's military offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Commentators have suggested that it is one of the most politically-charged Eurovisions ever. Earlier this year, 1,000 Swedish musicians signed an open letter urging Israel's exclusion. Artists have also been targeted by criticism, and in a statement last month the EBU said: ""We firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists."" Speaking to international reporters, this week Denmark's entrant SABA said she'd been under huge pressure: ""I've received a lot of messages and people can be very personal... even on the street."" Israel's National Security Council on Thursday issued an advisory warning against travelling to Malmo. With a population of 360,000, it is one of Sweden's most diverse cities. Some of Malmo's 1,200-strong Jewish community have said they feel nervous and apprehensive. Malmo also has a sizeable Palestinian community, and the contest has provoked strong feelings and weekly protests for months demanding that Eurovision boycott Israel. In the busy Triangeln area, Yomn Kadoura, one of the rally organisers and a Palestinian resident, told the BBC: ""Israel is not welcome to Malmo because they are bombing civilian people in Gaza."" Kadoura points out that Russia was banned after it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ""We cannot accept or normalise the genocide,"" she said: an accusation that Israel vehemently rejects. Police told the BBC that 10 separate applications had been lodged for demonstrations in the coming week. Two mass rallies in central Malmo, several kilometres away from the venue, will take place on Thursday and next Saturday, coinciding with the second semi-final and final. Other protests will be ""nearby"" but not in front of the arena. An alternative music performance is also being staged. Police expect the demonstration to be larger than the protests seen so far. ""Some weekends we have had up to 20,000 people,"" said police chief Petra Stenkula. ""We're hoping that even if we gave a large number of protesters, they're going to follow the rules,"" says Per-Erik Ebbestahl, adding that previous protests have been well-organised and issue-free. Among other demonstrations is a planned burning of a Quran, which police are yet to decide on. There is no law in Sweden that prohibits desecrating religious texts, but such acts have often provoked tension. ""It's something we work with all the time, but there have been some hard feelings before about these things in Malmo,"" said the city's police chief. But despite the tension offstage, Eurovision will always remain Eurovision, with a raft of events including a special ABBA exhibition celebrating 50 years since the Swedish quartet stole the show with Waterloo. ""I really hope it's going to be a fantastic, joyful week here in Malmo,"" said Ebba Adielsson of Swedish TV. ""Because there's so much love and passion for the Eurovision Song Contest.""",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68950907,politics
240,Universities brace for disruption at graduations by Gaza war protesters,"The next chapter of campus protests may soon begin, with universities across the US preparing for possible disruptions at graduation ceremonies. Four universities rocked by pro-Palestinian protests will hold graduations this weekend. Many others, including Columbia University, have scheduled ceremonies throughout the month and in June. Universities are working to enhance security while protesters contemplate walkouts and other possible actions. Protesters set up camps and staged campus demonstrations to call on their universities to cut ties with Israel over the war in Gaza. Many colleges responded by calling police, leading to thousands of arrests. There have been demonstrations at nearly 140 institutions across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University last month, according to a BBC tally. Student protesters have so far, for the most part, been quiet about plans for disruptions at graduations, which are known as commencements in the US. At Indiana University, however, IU Divest and the Palestine Solidarity Committee - whose camp at Indiana University was cleared by police twice in recent weeks - have called for a walk-out at graduation events. ""Make your pro-Palestine stance clear at the 'Liberated Zone' instead,"" reads a post on Instagram, referencing a protest area at the university's campus in Bloomington. ""Join us in wearing your keffiyeh along with your cap and gown."" The walk-out will be timed to happen when Pamela Whitten, the university president, begins to speak. Ms Whitten faced a no-confidence vote earlier in April from faculty members concerned about academic freedom after the cancellation of a Palestinian artist's exhibition and the suspension of a faculty member who served as a sponsor for a pro-Palestinian student group. Faculty members have also discussed holding ""a silent protest"" outside the commencement to make their displeasure known without interfering with the event, according to two sources who asked to remain anonymous. The University of Michigan, Ohio State University and the University of Connecticut - all of which have experienced demonstrations over the last two weeks - have graduations on 4 and 5 May. University of Michigan officials have announced plans for designated protest areas, where banners and flags will be prohibited and protesters will be subject to security screenings. The commencement will be watched over by volunteers who will ""respond to disruptions, beginning with warnings"", according to the university's website. Alifa Chowdhury, of the Tahrir Coalition protest group, declined to comment on whether any disruptions were planned.  She said the university had ""completely ignored"" offers to negotiate. ""It makes sense that they have been implementing strategies and training staff to make sure protests aren't happening,"" she said. Nearly 200 miles (320km) to the south, Ohio State University President Ted Carter has vowed to protect students' right to free speech while at the same time enforcing rules that bar ""intentional disruptions of university events, classes, exams or programming, including commencement"". Heba Latif, a Palestinian-American student and co-president of the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), would not say whether any protests were planned for the 5 May commencement ceremony. Graduation is scheduled for 15 May at Columbia. Police entered the campus earlier this week to clear a student occupation and are due to remain on campus throughout the commencement season. Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian international student at Columbia, told the BBC that the protest movement would continue regardless. ""Students have been protesting since October,"" said Mr Khalil. ""They've received disciplinary notices from the university, and suspensions, probation, and that has not stopped anyone. ""I don't see how bringing in the police will stop this movement."" Protesters at Columbia did not reply when asked repeatedly if any disruptions were planned.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68954382,politics
241,Palestinian doctor dies in Israeli prison,"A Palestinian doctor has died in an Israeli prison after more than four months in detention, Palestinian prisoner associations have said. Dr Adnan Al-Bursh, 50, was the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa Hospital. The Israeli prison service confirmed that a statement published on 19 April about a prisoner who was detained for national security reasons and had died in Ofer prison was Dr Al-Bursh. No details were given on the cause of death, and the prison service said the incident was being investigated. But the Palestinian prisoner advocacy groups said in a joint statement on Thursday that Dr Al-Bursh's death was an ""assassination"" and his body still remained in Israeli custody. Dr Al-Bursh was the head of orthopaedics at Gaza's largest medical facility, al-Shifa hospital, which has been raided several times by Israeli armed forces. He was temporarily working at Al-Awada hospital in north Gaza when he was detained by Israeli forces. Colleagues have paid tribute to the late surgeon, describing him as ""compassionate"" and ""heroic"". Al-Shifa's director, Dr Marwan Abu Saada, said the news of his death was difficult for the human soul to bear. Another colleague, Dr Suhail Matar, called Dr Al-Bursh “the safety valve” for every orthopaedic department in all of Gaza’s hospitals. ""It is rare that you meet a person like him in your life, because this doctor worked all his life with dedication and used to make tremendous efforts at the expense of himself,"" Dr Matar told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. He described his late colleague as someone who was never tired of working, and who was ""loved by everyone and his smile never went away"". Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza, said she was ""extremely alarmed"" by news of Dr Al-Bursh's death and called on the diplomatic community to take concrete measures to protect Palestinians. Meanwhile White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has discussed with Israel the importance of protecting humanitarian workers in Gaza. ""The president has said very clearly that when it comes to people who are... in Gaza providing that all-important care, humanitarian aid, humanitarian care, they need to be protected. They should be protected. And so certainly those conversations are going to continue,"" she said. ""We believe that certainly... the Israeli government has taken efforts to do just that and has taken into account our concerns and so we're going to continue to have those conversations but it is heartbreaking to hear."" Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that Dr Al-Bursh’s death meant that the total number of medical workers who had been killed by Israel since the 7 October attack now stands at 496. It added that 1,500 others had been wounded while 309 had been arrested. Medical facilities are protected under international law, but Israel says Hamas uses them as cover for military operations - something Hamas denies. The BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cer3740ddj3o,politics
242,NYPD officer fired gun while clearing Columbia protest,"A police officer accidentally fired his gun on the Columbia University campus while clearing pro-Palestinian protesters from a building on Tuesday, the New York Police Department said. No one was injured, and the bullet was found in a nearby wall. The matter is being investigated, city officials said. Police arrested 112 protesters this week after college leaders sought help clearing the Manhattan campus - a move that fractured the school community . The NYPD held a press conference on Friday to address the issue, following days of criticism for not announcing the incident when it happened three days prior. ""Accidental discharges happen every single year and we average about eight a year and we don't get request [for information] on it,"" NYPD spokesperson Sergeant Tarik Sheppard said. ""If you do ask about it, we'll talk about it like we're doing right now."" The NYPD said in a statement on Thursday night that an unnamed Emergency Service Unit officer was using a firearm's flashlight attachment to illuminate a barricade inside Hamilton Hall, which protesters occupied after being ordered to disperse. An officer fired a single shot into a wall a few feet away. The NYPD said it immediately investigated the incident and determined it was an accidental discharge. No student was near the area when the shot was fired, officials said. The police force did not publicly disclose the gunshot or its internal probe, however, until The City, a local news organisation, reported the matter. The officer's body camera captured the shooting, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office was given the footage for its Police Accountability Unit to review. Columbia University President Minouche Shafik called the NYPD to the campus Tuesday to clear Hamilton Hall, a school building that protesters occupied on Monday night. It was the second time Ms Shafik had police on campus in response to the pro-Palestinian encampment. Students and faculty will have very limited access to the campus for the remainder of the year, just weeks before the semester's end. The university announced that all final exams would be held online. Police released video of prying open doors, climbing through a second story window and clearing chairs and desks from stairwells in Hamilton. While the footage seemed to show that protesters had caused minor damage, it did not show a violent response from them. University students told the BBC earlier this week that the police acted ""rough and aggressive"" toward protesters, though the NYPD has denied this. The police said protesters detained on Tuesday were charged with a variety of offences: burglary, obstructing governmental administration, criminal mischief, resisting arrest, trespassing and disorderly conduct. NYPD data showed that about 29% of those arrested on campus were not affiliated with the university. The protests at Columbia University have helped to spark a greater US student movement to call attention to the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led health ministry says that more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict. The BBC has found that there were nearly 140 campus protests or encampments in response to the war in Israel, which followed Hamas's 7 October attack that killed 1,200 people. The students are demanding that their schools divest from arms manufacturers as well as institutions and businesses affiliated with Israel. They also want schools to publicly disclose their institutional investments. US lawmakers and officials have grown concerned that the demonstrations and encampments have led to a rise of antisemitic incidents and made campuses unsafe for Jewish students. That has led to increased pressure on university leaders to address the protests. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona was scheduled to meet with a group of Jewish leaders on Friday, and he reportedly sent a letter to university officials that condemned ""abhorrent"" acts of antisemitism on campus. ""As the 2023-24 school year comes to a close, I remain incredibly concerned by the reports of anti-Semitic hate directed at students on some campuses,"" he wrote in the letter that was obtained by CNN. Some universities have been able to end the pro-Palestinian protests peacefully. The University of Minnesota and Rutgers University announced on Thursday that they struck agreements with protesters to clear encampments. In exchange, school administrations agreed to consider the students' divestment demands and make their investments publicly accessible. But most protests have not ended as harmoniously, particularly in recent days. Police cleared demonstrators from an encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, on Wednesday arresting about 200 people. At Portland State University in Oregon on Thursday, authorities removed protesters from a library building and detained dozens of students. Early on Friday morning, student organisers said that the NYPD put 50 protesters at New York University and the New School on prison busses, removing them from encampments in downtown Manhattan. US President Joe Biden urged pro-Palestinian protesters on university campuses to uphold the rule of law. ""We are a civil society, and order must prevail,"" Mr Biden said Thursday at the White House, in his first direct remarks about the student demonstrations. Protests also surfaced beyond US borders, in countries including Canada, Australia and France. Police have said they are monitoring a growing encampment at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, after Quebec's premier called for it to be dismantled. Pro-Palestinian protesters camped out at the University of Toronto were allowed to remain, as long as ""activities remain peaceful"", the university said.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68947267,politics
243,What do pro-Palestinian student protesters at US universities want?,"Thousands of students, at more than 130 colleges and universities across the US, have demonstrated in opposition to the ongoing war in Gaza with protests and encampments. More than 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested, but the protests continue as universities prepare for graduation ceremonies in coming days. Since the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war. They are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment, for many of the protesters, means cutting those endowments' ties to Israeli companies or ones that do business with Israel. Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions. Student activists say that companies doing business in Israel, or with Israeli organisations, are complicit in its ongoing war in Gaza - as are colleges investing in those companies. University endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments. The encampments began last month, with dozens of students at Columbia University pitching tents on a campus lawn while the president of the New York City university testified before Congress about antisemitism. The police moved in a day later and detained the protesters, sparking a wave of action at other colleges across the US. Activists quickly set up camp again at Columbia and eventually moved into an academic building. The police were called in again due to vandalism and risks to public safety, the university said. More than 100 arrests were made as both the building and encampment were cleared. The escalating crisis at Columbia inspired similar protests and encampments across the country, including: The BBC has counted more than 130 colleges and universities in the US where protests or encampments have arisen in the past few weeks. Protests have occurred in 45 states and Washington D.C. Pro-Palestinian protesters have also gathered over the past week on university campuses in Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK. Some are negotiating with student activists while others are issuing ultimatums that have led to police being called in. An agreement was reached between Northwestern University near Chicago and protesters that limits the size of the encampment. Another deal was reached at Brown University where school officials agreed to hold a vote on divestment in October in exchange for students removing the encampment. National politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting antisemitic incidents at some protests. Jewish students at several campuses have told the BBC about incidents that made them feel uncomfortable or fearful. These ranged from chants and signs supporting Hamas, a proscribed terror group, to physical altercations and perceived threats. More than 2,000 people have been arrested at the demonstrations across the US, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press. In just the first two days of May alone, hundreds of arrests were made at campuses around the country, including Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas. At UCLA, 210 people were taken into custody after police moved in on a pro-Palestinian encampment. In New York, 282 were arrested earlier this week after police cleared Columbia's Hamilton Hall - which had been occupied by protesters - as well as the encampment on campus. The figure includes detentions made at the nearby City College of New York. Pro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel. No US university has ever committed to the BDS framework, although some have cut specific financial ties in the past. While divestment would have a negligible impact, if any, on the war in Gaza, protesters say it would shed light on those who profit from war and help build awareness of their issue. In response, Israel has banned some BDS groups from entering the country. Activists at Columbia and elsewhere have highlighted the protests at the end of the 1960s against US involvement in the Vietnam War. Thousands were arrested and there were violent clashes with police. Four students in Ohio were killed in 1970 when the National Guard opened fire. The National Guard is not being deployed to the Gaza campus protests. Their deaths triggered a nationwide student strike and hundreds of universities closed. Graduation ceremonies across the US are kicking off this weekend and some protests are expected including at Indiana University and the University of Michigan. It remains to be seen exactly what demonstrations at commencements will look like. At the University of Southern California, the commencement ceremony was cancelled altogether because of the potential impact of protests. On Friday, the school announced it would host an event celebrating graduating students at the LA Memorial Coliseum.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68908885,politics
244,French police remove pro-Gaza student protesters,"Riot police have forcibly removed pro-Palestinian protesters taking part in a sit-in at France's prestigious Sciences Po University in Paris. Protesters had occupied some buildings to demand that the university cut ties with Israel over the way it is conducting its war in the Gaza Strip. After their removal, groups headed to the Panthéon to continue their action. Pro-Palestinian protests have been taking part in university campuses in several countries, most notably the US, over the past few days. In Paris, dozens of riot police went into the buildings on Friday morning. They came out with defiant protesters. One of them said officials had given them an ultimatum to leave within 20 minutes, but that students had defied the order. Paris police said  ""91 people were removed without incident"". Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's office was equally determined, saying the authorities would deal with such protests firmly. Sciences Po closed its main buildings on Friday in response to the sit-in. A spokesperson said some of the Sciences Po campuses in Reims, Le Havre and Poitiers were also affected by protests. Similar protests were held in Lyons and Lille. But the protests in France have been more contained than in the US, a point emphasised by Mr Attal on Thursday. ""In contrast to what we see abroad, namely across the Atlantic, no permanent protest camp... has been established in France,"" the prime minister said. He was referring to the days-long camps set up in several American universities, which police have had to dismantle with the arrest of hundreds of people . Israel has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza. The UN's most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, has told the BBC that there is a ""plausible"" case that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Israel denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. More than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that ""the time is now"" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. He said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it. Mediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. It reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn406mdp413o,politics
245,Elyakim Libman: Remains of man thought to be Hamas hostage found in Israel,"One of the hostages thought to have been abducted by Hamas on 7 October has been declared dead after his body was found in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces have confirmed. The IDF said Elyakim Libman's remains were identified through a ""thorough and complex investigation"". Libman was working as a security guard at the Nova festival at the time of the attack. His family said he stayed behind for hours treating other wounded people. In its statement, the IDF said that on Friday, the National Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Ministry of Health had notified Libman's family that he was ""murdered in the October 7th massacre"" led by Hamas. It goes on to say that the remains were identified through ""a thorough and complex investigation conducted by the IDF, Israel Police, and the National Institute of Forensic Medicine"". Israeli media reports said his remains had been buried alongside another festival victim in error. In a Facebook post around the time of the attack, Libman's father Eliyahu said another guard told him his son had helped rescue others before trying to escape. He was last seen trying to help two badly-injured women. About 1,200 people were killed during the 7 October attack. More than 360 of those killed were attending the festival. About 130 hostages from more than 250 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued. More than 34,600 people have been killed in the subsequent Israeli offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68953413,politics
246,"Governments not protecting press freedom, report says","Political attacks on journalists are increasing across the globe, according to the annual World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. These attacks include the detention of journalists, the spreading of misinformation and suppression of independent voices. With more than half of the world’s population going to the polls in 2024, governments are failing to protect journalism, the organisation says. The report comes as the BBC warned that over 300 of its journalists were now working in exile from their home countries, amid increasing attacks on their reporting. ""Some political groups fuel hatred and distrust of journalists by insulting them, discrediting them, and threatening them,"" the organisation - known by its French acronym RSF - said. RSF’s index ranks 180 countries on the ability for journalists to work without interference or threats. Norway retained its spot at the top and “information desert” Eritrea came bottom, taking over from last year’s lowest-ranked nation, North Korea. The bottom 10 also includes China, Iran, Afghanistan , and Syria. Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland and Germany rounded out the top 10. The UK rose three places to 23, with RSF criticising the dominant role held by News UK, Reach Plc and Daily Mail and General Trust in the market. Authoritarian regimes across the Middle East have been tightening their grip on news and information with “increasing vigour”, according to the report. Four of the world’s biggest jailers of journalists, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iran, are in the region and continue to detain newsgatherers, according to the RSF report. At least 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 1 May 2024, according to the RSF. The United States (55) has fallen 10 places ahead of elections due to increasing attacks on journalists from political players. The report also criticised the ""highly concentrated"" model of US media ownership, adding that ""many of the companies buying American media outlets appear to prioritize profits over public interest journalism"". In Russia (ranked 162), RSF says the state continues a “crusade” against journalism with more than 1,500 journalists fleeing abroad since the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The reports comes as the number of BBC World Service journalists forced to work in exile has doubled since 2020 , reflecting press crackdowns in Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. Many face jail, death threats and harassment. The RSF also warned about the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes , calling its use in spreading misinformation “disturbing”.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy73gq39219o,politics
247,"What is Eurovision, and where and when is the 2024 final taking place?","The semi-finals and grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest will soon take place in Sweden. The UK automatically qualifies for the final, but singer Olly Alexander will showcase Britain's entry Dizzy at the first semi-final, on Tuesday. The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual televised competition organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The theme of the 2024 contest is ""united by music"", and it features 37 performers chosen to represent their country . Songs must be original and no more than three minutes long. Lead vocals must be live, and a maximum of six singers and dancers are allowed. Most Eurovision countries are European, but Australia takes part every year, after being invited to join Eurovision's 60th anniversary celebrations in 2015. However, Australia cannot host if it ever wins. Other non-European countries including Israel participate because they are members of the EBU. The 2024 contest is being held in Sweden, after Loreen won in 2023 with her song Tattoo. She became the first woman to win the contest twice, after triumphing in 2012 with Euphoria. This is the seventh time the contest has been held in Sweden, and the third time in Malmo. The contest will be hosted by actor Malin Åkerman and presenter and comedian Petra Mede, who was also at the helm in 2013 and 2016. As 2024 is the 50th anniversary of Swedish group Abba's first Eurovision win with Waterloo, there had been speculation about the band's potential involvement. But Abba members told the BBC they would not perform. The grand final will be at the Malmo Arena on Saturday 11 May. Sweden will be the first country to perform, after a random draw. The semi-finals are on Tuesday 7 and Thursday 9 May. Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK are guaranteed places in the final, so do not compete in either semi-final. However, the host country and ""big five"" will perform their songs during the semi-finals. Fifteen countries will compete in the first semi-final on Tuesday 7 May, including Croatia, Ireland, Ukraine and Australia. Sixteen countries will feature in the second semi-final on Thursday 9 May, including Austria, Denmark, Greece and Israel. Both semi-finals and the grand final will be broadcast live on BBC One, BBC Radio 2, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds. The semi-finals will be hosted by commentators Scott Mills, Richie Anderson and Rylan, while Graham Norton will do the honours for the grand final. Pop star Olly Alexander is representing the UK at the 2024 contest , with his song Dizzy. The former Years and Years frontman is hoping to improve on the UK's disappointing performance in 2023, when Mae Muller came second to last. Alexander is well-known around Europe for hits including Desire, King and If You're Over Me. He is also a Bafta-nominated actor, having played the lead role in Channel 4's hard-hitting Aids drama It's A Sin. Israel's representative, Eden Golan, will sing a song called Hurricane - a rewritten version of the country's original entry, October Rain, which was thought to reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. The lyrics now tell the story of a woman experiencing a personal crisis, according to Israel's public broadcaster, Kan. Kan initially said it would withdraw from the contest rather than change the lyrics. But after the organisers barred the song for its political content, the country's president, Isaac Herzog, called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure Israel could compete. Separately, musicians and organisations from a number of countries have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza. Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists said Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"". Similar objections have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with many pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Alexander rejected calls to pull out of the contest in protest against Israel's inclusion. Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different. The EBU has also said that abuse and harassment of artists over Israel's participation is ""unacceptable"". The semi-finals are decided entirely by a public vote from competing countries and people in the rest of the world. Audiences in the UK, Germany, Sweden and the other countries which are not competing in either semi-final can vote. For the final, every country which qualifies awards two sets of scores: one from a jury of experts and one by fans. Each of their 10 favourite songs is given points - but they cannot vote for their own country's song. Their favourite act receives 12 points, their second-favourite 10 points, their third choice eight points, and then seven points, and so on, down to one point for their 10th favourite. Eurovision was one of the first televised competitions to let viewers vote. Fans in Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK began voting by phone in 1997. The rest of the world was allowed to vote in 2023, with points given to the 10 most popular songs worldwide. Each participating broadcaster pays an entrance fee to the EBU. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK pay the most, although the BBC does not make its contribution public. It is thought staging the 2023 event in Liverpool cost the BBC between £8m and £17m. The UK government pledged £10m, while local authorities in Liverpool committed £4m.",2024-05-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68425861,politics
248,Turkey halts trade with Israel over 'humanitarian tragedy' in Gaza,"Turkey has suspended all trade with Israel over its offensive in Gaza, citing the ""worsening humanitarian tragedy"" in the strip. The Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an ""uninterrupted and sufficient flow"" of aid into Gaza. Trade between the two countries was worth almost $7bn (£5.6bn) last year. Israel's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator"". Israel Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was ""disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements"". He added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries. The ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's ""uncompromising attitude"" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: ""Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption."" In 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. But relations have worsened in recent decades. In 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. Relations were restored in 2016, but both countries expelled each other's top diplomats two years later in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border. Mr Erdogan has become increasingly strident in his criticism of Israel since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October last year. He has repeatedly criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, comparing him to Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Joseph Stalin and dubbing him ""the butcher of Gaza"". Mr Netanyahu has said Turkey's leader is the last person who can preach morality to Israel. In March he said President Erdogan ""supports the mass murderers and rapists of Hamas, denies the Armenian genocide [and] massacres Kurds in his own country"". The Turkish leader has for months come under domestic political pressure to announce measures against Israel, from both opponents and allies. His ruling AK party suffered its worst defeat in two decades in local elections at the end of March, and many religious voters supported the Islamist New Welfare party, which had called for hardline measures against Israel. Not long after the vote, Turkey imposed restrictions on 54 products being exported to Israel, from iron and steel to jet fuel, pesticides and construction equipment. The trade ministry in Ankara said on Thursday that the action was now being extended to all exports and imports. Israel was Turkey's 13th biggest export market in 2023, receiving 2.1% of Turkish exports last year. Turkey was Israel's fifth biggest source of imports last year. Israel has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May. On Thursday, the White House said a pier built by the US military to facilitate the flow of aid into the territory would be open within days. The US has published photos showing logistics vessels and personnel assembling the floating pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship. However, the UN says a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and that land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed. Earlier this week, Israel reopened the Erez Crossing into the northern Gaza strip for aid convoys, under pressure from its Western allies and following repeated appeals from international aid organisations. However, Jordan said some of its aid lorries were attacked by Israeli settlers before reaching the crossing. A recent UN-backed report offered hard statistical evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine. The UN's most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, told the BBC that there was a ""plausible"" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Israel denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that ""the time is now"" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there.

249,Biden says 'order must prevail' after UCLA Gaza protest camp cleared,"US President Joe Biden has urged pro-Palestinian protesters on university campuses to uphold the rule of law. ""We are a civil society, and order must prevail,"" Mr Biden said from the White House, in his first direct remarks about a wave of student unrest. Police have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps. That includes 209 arrests early on Thursday at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Hundreds of officers in riot gear moved on to UCLA's main campus before dawn and cleared its pro-Palestinian camp. They set off flash bangs and flares, loaded demonstrators on to police buses, and tore down the makeshift barriers and tents that had been erected on campus a week ago. In a statement, UCLA called the camp ""both unlawful and a breach of policy. It led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission."" ""Demonstrators directly interfered with instruction by blocking students' pathways to classrooms,"" it added, while their clashes with pro-Israeli counter-demonstrators ""put too many [students] in harm's way"". Addressing the nationwide protests hours later, Mr Biden said: ""We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent. But neither are we a lawless country. ""There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos. People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked."" The Uncommitted National Movement, a group of Arab-American voters opposed to Mr Biden's re-election campaign this year, accused him of ""smearing"" anti-war protesters. ""It's clear Biden isn't listening to young people nationwide, or to the over half a million uncommitted voters asking him to change course. We hope he hears us before it's too late,"" leader Abbas Alawieh said. The campus protests in support of Gaza have now spread to nearly 140 colleges in at least 45 states, according to a BBC tally, and at least six other countries. Demonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict. But many colleges have called in the police, with violence erupting on some campuses, as well as rising reports of antisemitic harassment against Jewish students. The tensions at UCLA's main Westwood campus erupted on Tuesday night when a masked pro-Israeli group breached the tent camp on Dickson Plaza and attacked campers with bats, tear gas and other items. Police appeared to move slowly and were criticised by students, observers and some political leaders for their response. After regaining control of the area on Wednesday, law enforcement created a tight security cordon. Administrators had already declared ""an unlawful assembly"" and, early on Thursday morning, officers moved in. As police breached the perimeter, some demonstrators could be seen locking arms and using their plywood barriers as makeshift shields, while others donned hard hats and seemed to arm themselves with umbrellas. Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, said she had been at an ""incident command post"" alongside law enforcement leaders at the campus throughout the operation. ""Harassment, vandalism and violence have no place at UCLA or anywhere in our city,"" she wrote in a statement. Kenza, a UCLA student involved with the protests (she did not provide her last name), told the BBC the encampment had been ""completely peaceful"". ""It's absolutely ridiculous that we would be deemed as a threat to civil society when the reality is we have been harassed for the past week,"" she said. Campus operations will be limited on Thursday and Friday, with all classes moving to remote instruction, UCLA said. A handful of institutions - including Northwestern, Brown, the University of Minnesota and the University of Vermont - have reached agreements with protesters over divestment matters. But arrests have been made in the past 24 hours at Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68945049,politics
250,"More UK students occupy campuses, in Gaza protest","More students are occupying their university campuses in the UK in protest against the war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds have set up tents outside university buildings. Students at Goldsmiths, University of London, have occupied the library. The student protests in the UK come after more than 1,000 people were arrested after pro-Palestinian protests on campuses across the US. While the number of students protesting in the UK is smaller than in the US, the number of universities seeing protests is growing. One camp, at Warwick University, has been set up in the campus's piazza for a week. But others, including at Sheffield and Bristol, started on Wednesday. Protest organisers told BBC News they wanted their universities to divest from Israel in response to its deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. Divestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties. The prime minister's spokesman said police would ""have our full support"" if students in the UK tried to replicate protests at US universities. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said: ""We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest - but clearly, people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption."" Palestine Solidarity Campaign youth and student campaigns officer Stella Swain said: ""All the protests so far have been completely peaceful. ""There is nothing to indicate that they wouldn't be."" And she hoped no politician, regardless of their views on the issue, would want to see police in the UK respond to protesters in the same way as officers in the US. On Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a ""hostile and toxic atmosphere"" on campuses. ""It is time that universities take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously,"" it added. Student protesters rejected this characterisation of the demonstrations, telling BBC News Jewish students were camping with them. Samira, who asked for her surname to be withheld, said Jewish students were ""very much a part of"" the occupation at her university, Goldsmiths. ""I'm proud that there are Jewish students in the occupation with me and on the marches in central London with me,"" she said, adding the pro-Palestinian movement supported ""peace and justice"". Manchester student Sam, who also asked for his surname to be withheld, said their occupation had been co-organised with Jewish students. Students set up camp in Brunswick Park, near the university's campus, on Wednesday. And Sam said: ""This encampment has been co-organised by Jewish students. ""And there are several Jewish students who are here every day and staying every night,"" he said. UK universities have in general supported the students' right to free speech and to protest. Goldsmiths said: ""We recognise that people hold strong views over the war, and uphold their right to freely express themselves while being clear about the need to be respectful and within the law."" It was ""in dialogue with students over these issues"" and was funding scholarships for Palestinian students. The University of Manchester, meanwhile, said while it ""fully recognises"" the right to protest, ""setting up camp in a city campus raises potential health and safety concerns, risks disruption to staff, students and our wider community, and ultimately is an unauthorised and unlawful use of the university's campus"". ""We will do everything possible to maintain business as usual,"" it added.",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68944591,politics
251,Alarm in Israel at reports of possible ICC legal action over Gaza,"Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes. Reports suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be among them. The ICC, based in The Hague, has been investigating Israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of Hamas as well. It has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law. It has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony. Mr Netanyahu has called the prospect of senior Israel figures joining the wanted list ""an outrage of historic proportions"", accusing the ICC of attempting to paralyse Israel's ability to defend itself. But the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that, behind the scenes, such a scenario is being actively discussed. While the ICC has not confirmed the Israeli claims, when Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited Israel and the occupied West Bank last December his message was a clear one. The British barrister toured the sites of Hamas' attacks in Israeli villages close to the Gaza fence, which Hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 October. He also met political leaders, and travelled to Ramallah to speak to the families of Palestinian victims about their experiences in Gaza and the West Bank. He condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides, and promised to investigate. ""All actors must comply with international humanitarian law,"" he clarified in a statement at the time. ""If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act."" Mr Khan said the 7 October attacks - in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies - represented ""some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address"". In Israel's case, his concerns were twofold. He stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in Gaza according to ""clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict"". Israel has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment, although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties. The Hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began, and that many of that number are children. Mr Khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, with access to food, water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians ""without further delay, and at pace and at scale"". He also urged Hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive, after accusations by Israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid, stopping it from reaching the wider population. Israel isn't a member of the ICC and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it. But the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza after the Palestinians ratified its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, as the State of Palestine. No Western-style democracy has had an ICC arrest warrant issued for its leader before. If it happens to Mr Netanyahu, he'll be the first. Israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it. Michael Oren was Israel's ambassador to the United States between 2009 and 2013. He points to the recent case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza - an accusation Israel vehemently rejects. In January, the court issued an interim ruling that ordered Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive. ""Israel emerged from those proceedings relatively unscathed, but the fact that the proceedings were held at all meant that Israel had lost the battle,"" he told the BBC. ""They should not have been held at all, and certainly it's a blow to our international standing and our security. Because a country whose leaders are accused of presiding over war crimes, that country is more vulnerable than a country that isn't."" Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, another British barrister, led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). He points out that the actions of both sides in this conflict are within the ICC's focus. ""Any investigation will not just be the Israeli Defense Forces and political and military leadership but also Hamas,"" he told the BBC. ""It's to be hoped that alleged Hamas fighters and leaders are not all shot on sight, that they are detained and made available for trial by an international tribunal."" He also addressed suggestions that the ICC could come under political pressure to reconsider its decision-making. ""Governments around the world, particularly large and powerful governments, are there to protect their country's interests. ""So if they see a trial coming along, or an investigation... that would cause them as a country great reputational damage, and if they reckon they can interfere with the trial or the investigative or trial processes to save them from that reputational damage, then they'll do that, because they are acting in the interests of their country."" The timeframe for issuing warrants can vary, with weeks and even months sometimes elapsing between the point at which the ICC prosecutor requests it, and judges grant it. Sometimes the details can be kept confidential if it's deemed that making them public would lessen the prospect of an arrest. Such a move against Mr Netanyahu, his political colleagues or Israeli military commanders would have practical implications too. It would affect their ability to travel widely, as Rome Statute nations are obligated to hand over visiting individuals with outstanding warrants against them. However, some of those nations have ignored ICC warrants in recent years. Former Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren believes the eventual impact would be far wider, changing the narrative of Israeli society ""Generally, it responds to love. It doesn't respond to aggression. If you want to get concessions out of Israelis do not hit them over the head, embrace them,"" he said. ""All of these measures tend to move the political needle in this country rightward and not the other way. It would have a boomerang effect, and rather than opening pathways to possible diplomatic process it will likely constrict it.""",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68938022,politics
252,UCLA clashes: Police criticised for 'delayed' response to violence,"The office of California's governor has criticised the police response to violence on campus at the University of California, Los Angeles. A masked pro-Israeli group assaulted a pro-Palestinian student camp, before officers were called to the campus. Governor Gavin Newsom's spokesperson said the ""limited and delayed"" police intervention was ""unacceptable"". Hundreds of police swarmed the campus early on Wednesday morning after more than two hours of fighting. State officials and university leaders have said they immediately deployed security personnel to the tent camp on Dickson Plaza when clashes erupted just before midnight on Tuesday. But several people on site said law enforcement did not act quickly enough. ""Law enforcement simply stood at the edge of the lawn and refused to budge as we screamed for their help,"" UC Divest at LA, a group involved in the encampment, said in a statement. The BBC has contacted UCLA and LAPD for a response. The university declared the pro-Palestinian encampment, in the shadow of its Royce Hall, an illegal gathering on Tuesday. Footage online shows that, as midnight approached on Tuesday, a large pro-Israeli group donning black outfits and white masks arrived on campus and attempted to dismantle barriers. Campers, some wearing goggles and helmets, and others carrying placards and umbrellas, rallied to defend their makeshift space. Dylan Winward, a reporter with the Daily Bruin student newspaper, said the counter-demonstrators had thrown objects including ""fireworks, a scooter, water bottles and tear gas"". The Bruin also said on social media that four of its reporters had been assaulted and sprayed with an irritant early on Wednesday morning by attackers who recorded the incident on their mobile phones. ""Tonight they escalated to a whole new level, they started inciting violence,"" one pro-Palestinian student activist told the BBC. Protesters started leaving the site roughly two hours after the attack began and police had established control as day broke on Wednesday morning. It is unclear whether police made any arrests. Governor Newsom condemned the violence in a post on X, formerly Twitter, separate to his office's statement. ""The law is clear,"" he said. ""The right to free speech does not extend to inciting violence, vandalism or lawlessness."" He said those responsible ""must be held accountable... including through criminal prosecution, suspension, or expulsion"". Citing law enforcement sources, the Los Angeles Times reports there were only a few UCLA police officers on hand and they retreated because they were outnumbered by the crowd. According to the newspaper, reinforcements were called from California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles and it took three hours to bring the situation under control. The overnight clash at one of America's top public colleges took place only hours after police in New York City raided and cleared a Columbia University building taken over by students. Protests at Columbia against the war in Gaza have inspired similar actions at universities - small and large, public and private - in more than two dozen states, with activists demanding that institutions cut financial ties with Israel and companies profiting from the war. On Wednesday, state troopers arrested 17 anti-war protesters at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the BBC's Tom Bateman on campus, while the NYPD arrested at least 15 people at Fordham University in the Bronx. UCLA cancelled classes on Wednesday, as it sought to ease tensions on the central quad of its Westwood campus. Mary Osako, a UCLA vice-chancellor, said police and other first responders were called to the scene of its encampment over ""horrific acts of violence"" early on Wednesday morning. ""We are sickened by this senseless violence and it must end,"" she said. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass slammed the clashes as ""absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable"". Speaking later on Wednesday, she called for an investigation into the violence. ""Those involved in launching fireworks at other people, spraying chemicals and physically assaulting others will be found, arrested and prosecuted, as well as anyone involved in any form of violence or lawlessness,"" she said. By morning, a tight security cordon was in place as a handful of protesters fortified their encampment. It remains unclear how many of the people involved in the night-time chaos, particularly on the pro-Israeli side, are students at the university. The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations blamed the violence on a ""mob of pro-Israel extremists"". Meanwhile, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles sought to distance itself from the violence, but blamed the university's chancellor for allowing ""an environment to be created over many months that has made students feel unsafe"". ""The abhorrent actions of a few counterprotesters last night do not represent the Jewish community or our values,"" the group wrote. ""We believe in peaceful, civic discourse."" Earlier on Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said several out of some 300 arrests at two New York campuses had been ""outside agitators"". Pressure has been mounting on college leaders to rein in pro-Palestinian protests as they spread across the country. But University of California leaders had sought to pursue a more light-touch approach to the demonstrations that colleagues across the country. College guidance to managing protests changed in 2011, after heavy handed policing during a demonstration on campus sparked outrage. Guidelines stated that the college should allow protests as long as they are peaceful, with police action used as a last resort. Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

253,Columbia University community 'shattered' after police raid,"Police and private security throng every entrance but one. Steel barriers line the streets. Students pack up belongings in their cars and leave for home - classes are cancelled, and exam plans are up in the air. Everywhere there is gloom, and uncertainty about what happens next at Columbia University in New York City. Students told the BBC that the university's decision to call in police to clear a Gaza protest late on Tuesday, leading to a raid on the occupied Hamilton Hall and more than 100 arrests, has left the college community shattered. The university president, Minouche Shafik, said that it was with great regret that she had ordered the police raid against students and others she said had infiltrated the protest. It would ""take time to heal"", she added in a message in the operation's aftermath. For students of this prestigious school in Manhattan, how long is unclear. ""It definitely feels like things are scattered,"" said Anna Oakes, a graduate journalism student at Columbia University who covered the removal of protesters from Hamilton Hall on Tuesday evening. ""There's this feeling of scramble in the aftermath."" After a night of chaos and confrontation, the clearest reminder of the protests on Wednesday morning was water-logged flyers littering streets alongside the campus perimeter. One said that protest organisers ""will not stop. We will not rest"". Students who remained said they were in the dark about plans for their finals and even whether dining services would be brought back fully. While others speed off in cars packed with possessions, Will Parkinson, a 20-year-old environmental studies student, described his feeling: ""Weird limbo."" ""We're not sure what to do,"" he said, and recounted how he watched from a friend's dorm window as police stormed Hamilton Hall. He had been barred from leaving the building during the raid, which meant he was unable to get home and finish a term paper. Mr Parkinson said Columbia had given students money to spend at nearby restaurants because they had to limit staff who would normally operate the university's cafeterias. He had left campus to eat, and was not sure when he would eventually write that paper. Others continued to peacefully protest, walking near the new steel barriers, holding slogans including ""Cops off campus"" and ""Student power v Israel power"". Members of the faculty, whose access to campus and offices is now largely denied, said they did not know how they were expected to conclude the semester. ""I have students who can't get to their work study to pay for school, I have faculty members with papers they need to grade locked in their offices, I have 16 instructors looking to me for guidance on how to support students through finals and the end of the semester,"" said Joseph Howley, a classics professor who has worked with the student protesters. ""So it has completely upended everything we do."" Unable to address those academic obligations, Prof Howley led dozens of students and faculty members in a protest outside the one campus entrance left unobstructed on Wednesday afternoon. He and others said that the university administration had lost their trust by bringing police on to campus, and that they shouted ""shame"" in unison when Dr Shafik's name was mentioned. One unidentified speaker at the protest said she was at Hamilton Hall when police ""ambushed us. We were tackled and beaten, and my hands were handcuffed so tightly that even lifting my pinky caused extreme harm and excruciating pain"". The NYPD denied that it was unnecessarily aggressive, and the administration has defended its decision to bring in police - who will remain on campus until 17 May. Meghnad Bose, a 31-year-old journalism graduate student at Columbia University, witnessed the NYPD raid on Tuesday night and said police acted ""rough and aggressive"" with the protesters. While 109 people at Columbia University were arrested when police stormed the school to quash the pro-Palestinian protest, police said at a Wednesday press conference that they arrested another 173 people at a similar sit-in at the City College of New York later in the evening. Police Commissioner Edward Caban said officers intervened because ""public safety was a real concern... the NYPD was called in to do their job"". A 19-year-old physics student named Kevin - he declined to give his last name - said it was ""difficult to be proud of being a Columbia student"" after the police raid, which had left him deeply frustrated. He spoke while piling bags full of clothes into his parents' car just outside the campus gates, and said he was unsure when he would return. ""It depends on what the university does in the coming months,"" he said. ""We'll see what they [the administration] say about it. The ball is in their court.""

254,Blinken says 'time is now' for Israel-Hamas deal in Gaza,"US secretary of state Antony Blinken has told Israel and Hamas that ""the time is now"" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. Mr Blinken said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it. Mediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. It reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners. ""We are determined to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home and to get it now, and the only reason that that wouldn't be achieved is because of Hamas,"" Mr Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv. ""There is a proposal on the table, and as we've said, no delays, no excuses. The time is now."" A senior Hamas official has denied the group is to blame for delays on reaching a new deal. Families of the hostages were demonstrating outside and Mr Blinken greeted them, saying setting their loved ones free was ""at the heart of everything we're trying to do"". About 130 hostages from among 253 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued. The top US diplomat later visited the Israeli port of Ashdod, about 30km (20 miles) north of Gaza, where he insisted that Israel had made meaningful concessions to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal. Mr Blinken said Israel had made progress on getting more aid into Gaza but this needed to be accelerated given the immense scale of need. Ashdod was recently opened to aid shipments destined for Gaza, where the UN has warned of severe food shortages and looming famine. On Wednesday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 30 trucks of humanitarian supplies from Jordan had for the first time entered northern Gaza via the Erez crossing. Mr Blinken also repeated the US position that Israel should not launch a military incursion into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah without a clear plan to protect more than a million Palestinians who have been sheltering from the war there in dire humanitarian conditions. ""On Rafah itself - our position is clear, it has not changed, it won't change. We cannot, will not support a major military operation in Rafah absent an effective plan making sure that civilians are not harmed. We have not seen such a plan,"" he said. Rafah is the only major city in Gaza that IDF ground forces have not taken control of during half a year of war. However the city has been repeatedly hit by deadly Israeli air strikes. On Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who also met Mr Blinken on Wednesday - said Israel would launch an invasion of Rafah regardless of truce talks with Hamas. ""We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory,"" he said. Members of Mr Netanyahu's governing coalition are divided on the issue. Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli TV a Rafah operation would be suspended if there was a deal. But far-right ministers have said if that happens they will bring down the government. The UN, Western allies of Israel and humanitarian agencies have all warned that an assault on Rafah risks a humanitarian disaster. West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it would be the ""biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history"" because, he said, it would trigger large-scale displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza entirely. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68939445,politics
255,Students occupy UK university campuses in protest over Gaza,"Pro-Palestinian students have occupied some university campuses in the UK, to protest against the war in Gaza. Students in Leeds, Newcastle and Bristol set up tents outside university buildings, on Wednesday, and called for supporters to donate food, drinks and hygiene products. Elsewhere, student activists held marches and one-off protests. One camp, at Warwick University, has been set up in the town's piazza for a week. The UK protests follow much larger demonstrations on campuses across the US, most prominently at Columbia University, in New York. More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested in the US - dozens on Tuesday night, after police raided a Columbia building occupied by students for almost two weeks. Organisers of the Warwick protest said they had begun the occupation because the university had ""ignored"" previous demonstrations. ""After countless demonstrations, sit-ins, open letters and even a motion through our students union, the university hasn't even engaged with us, let alone met our demands,"" they said on a fundraising page. Warwick University said it was ""working to begin discussions"" with the protesters about their demands. ""We recognise our students and staff have a right to voice their opinions, as freedom of speech is a vital component of university life,"" it said. ""We are continuing to urge everyone to respect the views of others even when they are different to their own."" Protesters want their universities to divest from Israel in response to its deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. Divestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties. Lewi, who asked for his surname be withheld, told BBC News he had been at the Newcastle encampment since it had begun, at about 08:00 on Wednesday, and students across the country had coordinated their protests for roughly the same time. About 60 students and staff members were there, with more expected to join for a rally later in the day, he said. ""We've tried to be democratic since 10 October, when activism on campus began,"" Lewi said. ""And since then, we've had no luck. ""So now, we've resorted to an indefinite encampment until the university will enter negotiations with us."" Northumbria Police told BBC News there was ""a proportionate policing presence"" at the protest. Lewi said the UK protests, while influenced by the Columbia occupation, were distinct. ""What's happened at Columbia has obviously inspired us to a degree but we have been thinking about this for a while,"" he said, adding the police response to student protests in the UK was ""less heavy-handed generally than the US"". ""Thankfully we're able to have our free speech on campus to a degree. ""And we're able to have freedom of assembly. ""So while the thing in Columbia has inspired us, I think there is a slight difference in what we're both wanting."" Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

256,Arrests at Columbia of Gaza protesters after NYPD raid,"Over 300 pro-Palestinian protesters at New York City university campuses were arrested Tuesday night after hundreds of police officers raided a building the students had taken over. Dramatic footage showed police climbing a ladder to enter Hamilton Hall, which had been occupied at Columbia University, and later removing people handcuffed with zip ties. The university had earlier told any students involved to leave or face expulsion. Officials have said the building was cleared and no injuries were reported. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said on Wednesday that nearly 300 people in total were arrested - including 119 at Columbia University and 173 from the nearby City College of New York - on charges of trespassing, criminal mischief and burglary. The NYPD is still working to decipher who was affiliated with the university out of those who were arrested. At Wednesday's news conference, New York Mayor Eric Adams said students had a ""right to protest"". But he added: ""There's nothing peaceful about barricading buildings, destroying property or dismantling security cameras."" The demonstrators want the university to divest from Israel over its continuing deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. The Columbia protest is one of dozens across the country, including at campuses in Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, New Mexico, California, New Jersey, Connecticut and Louisiana, where police have arrested more than 1,000 protesters. The Columbia arrests came just before violence erupted over the war in Gaza at another campus hundreds of miles away on the West Coast. Lengthy clashes broke out early Wednesday morning between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California in Los Angeles, after school administrators moved to shut down an encampment it called ""unlawful"". Counter-demonstrators clad in black arrived at the campus around midnight local time, before trying to tear down barricades around the encampment, the LA Times reported. Video footage showed flares and fireworks being set off, while other clips showed scuffles between the groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the scenes ""abhorrent and inexcusable"" and said police officers had arrived at the campus. In New York, meanwhile, school officials authorised police officers to enter Hamilton Hall at Columbia University after student demonstrators inside defied a deadline to disperse. One student told the BBC that around 80-100 police stormed the building. Columbia said that after the hall was ""occupied, vandalised and blockaded, we were left with no choice"". In a letter to the New York Police Department (NYPD), President Minouche Shafik wrote that she requested police aid ""with the utmost regret"". Officers said they used flashbang grenades to ""disorient protesters"" as the raid commenced, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. Some students could be heard shouting ""Shame on you!"" at the officers as they entered the building around 21:30 EST. NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said those in the building tried to lock the police out, but officials were still able to gain access. Some students alleged that police clad in riot gear manhandled demonstrators as they stormed the building, with one telling the BBC that three people had been pushed down the stairs by NYPD officers. The interview was cut short moments later after an officer interrupted and slammed shut a window through which the conversation had been happening. NYPD assistant commissioner of public information, Carlos Nieves, defended the officers. He said that students had ""barricaded"" the doors to Hamilton Hall with ""conference tables, chairs or soda machines"". He alleged they had also blocked windows with newspaper so officers ""couldn't see"". Huge cheers of support by anti-war crowds were heard as the arrested students were marched off with their hands in zip ties. People also chanted: ""Let them go!"" The activists have been occupying a tent camp at the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan for nearly two weeks. All was relatively quiet on Columbia's campus on Wednesday as non-essential visitors are not allowed to enter. Some Columbia students could be seen packing up their possessions with the help of their parents. The school has gone fully remote, and it will retain NYPD officers on campus until 17 May. National politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting reports of antisemitism at some of the demonstrations. President Joe Biden earlier said demonstrations should be peaceful, but ""forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful - it is wrong"". His Democratic colleague, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, condemned the police response at Columbia and urged Mayor Eric Adams to find a ""de-escalatory path"". ""This is the opposite of leadership and endangers public safety,"" she wrote. ""A nightmare in the making. I urge the mayor to reverse course."" Another New York Democrat, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, attacked what he called ""the militarisation of college campuses"" by police.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68933066,politics
257,Gaza: Pro-Palestinian protesters block weapons plant,"About 50 pro-Palestinian protesters have blocked staff from entering a site run by Britain's biggest defence firm. They waved Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans outside two gates at BAE Systems munitions plant in Glascoed, Monmouthshire. One banner read, ""BAE stop armed genocide"" while others said ""Welsh weapons cause genocide"" and ""UK weapons kill"". It is one of four blockades at sites across the UK. Many of the protesters covered their faces and said they were demonstrating against the production of weapons, and the war in Gaza. ""Hopefully we can see these places shut down for good,"" said one, Neezo Dahan, who described himself as a human rights activist. ""We are here to demonstrate using our democratic and fundamental right to oppose the ongoing genocide,"" he said, explaining that the protest included various groups, including members of the Wales Peace Coalition. Gwent Police said: ""We're aware of an ongoing protest in Glascoed... our officers are in attendance to facilitate a peaceful and safe gathering."" BAE Systems said: ""The protesters blocked the entrance and that has prevented staff from accessing the site this morning.""",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-68936813,politics
258,Hersh Goldberg-Polin: Gaza hostage's mother pleads for ceasefire deal,"The mother of an Israeli-American man being held in Gaza has told the BBC that Israel and Hamas must urgently agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. Rachel Goldberg-Polin's son Hersh, who turned 23 four days before he was kidnapped from the Nova festival on 7 October, was seen in captivity in a new video released last week . She described how she felt when she first watched it. ""As soon as I heard his voice I started to cry, because I haven't heard his voice in half a year. ""To see him moving, and to see that he is clearly medically compromised, and that he's fragile. His father Jon and I were both just crying, and I was holding my heart."" ""I don't even know what I was saying. I was just making noises and crying, and Jon was crying"". Hersh Goldberg-Polin was at the Nova music festival in a forested area close to the Gaza Strip when Hamas-led gunmen stormed Israel's border fence, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 360 of those killed were attending the festival event. Hersh managed to get several kilometres away from the festival site in a car, before seeking refuge in a roadside bomb shelter with several dozen others. But outside, Hamas gunmen gathered and began throwing in grenades. Before Wednesday, the last time he had been seen alive was in a Hamas video that showed him being loaded on to a pick-up truck, with part of his left arm missing. In the new video, posted to Hamas's Telegram account, Hersh lifts his arm to the camera to show a healed stump where his hand should be. He criticises Israel's military campaign in Gaza before speaking directly to his parents and two sisters, urging them to keep campaigning for his release. ""We're clearly very concerned about the injury,"" Mrs Goldberg-Polin told me. ""We've had several surgeons who have seen the video that say he needs another surgery immediately. If he was treated, it was an emergency treatment. He needs a second surgery at least."" ""He is considered in a fragile and compromised medical state, and so we're concerned about that."" As a 23-year-old man, Hersh would not be expected to be included in the next batch of hostages whose release is being discussed, which includes woman and the elderly. But those with medical conditions also fall into the category to be freed, and so the family hope that he will be included - although they have not had any confirmation. Mrs Goldberg-Polin says she is scheduled to meet the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, on his latest visit to Israel, which it is hoped will give further impetus to the negotiations. She had a clear message for all of the parties involved. ""I think that everyone here has leverage. Everyone is using their leverage. But are they using it to the maximum? The answer is clearly no. Because we still have 133 people there in Gaza. ""I am hopeful and optimistic. I'm really praying that all the parties, everyone decides that they're going to be courageous, be daring, and put an end to all the suffering in this region"". It is expected that Hamas will respond to the latest Israeli proposal in the next 24 hours. The hope is that it can provide a foundation to negotiate a concrete deal, and not be rejected outright. The details are yet to be officially confirmed but are believed to involve the release of 33 hostages during a five to six week ceasefire. An as-yet-unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. There is also believed to be a commitment to discuss a future end point for the war. But even as those discussions continue, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is planning a ground offensive in Rafah regardless of the outcome . Around 1.4 million displaced Palestinians are sheltering there after fleeing their homes during the heavy fighting in northern and central parts of Gaza. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has been conducting a military campaign to destroy Hamas and free the hostages. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages - most of them women and children - in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68934254,politics
259,Crackdown or compromise? A tale of two US campus protests,"The police arrived in force at dawn on Saturday, with orders to clear ""infiltrators"" from the Gaza war protest camp at Northeastern University in Boston. Within an hour, more than 100 people were under arrest, students and non-students alike, and many of their tents flattened or removed. A large counter-protest then formed, as officers from the state police in tactical gear hauled off their suspects. The scene was one of confrontation, and chaos. Northeastern campus administrators said they were compelled to call police as infiltration by outsiders ""led to a clear escalation in tensions"" and that an antisemitic slur had been heard - something the protesters deny. As the campus protests stretch into a second week across the US, Northeastern is among many colleges that have now taken the decision to crack down hard and refused calls to divest from companies involved in Israel's military. Columbia in New York squashed the very first camp on 18 April, citing ""a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students"". Since then they have blanked protester demands and announced suspensions for some students. The student response has been escalation, and on Tuesday dozens occupied and damaged a university building, leading to officials threatening expulsions. On Tuesday night, police moved onto campus in force at the university's request to end the occupation. Other colleges, however, have shown that confrontation, chaos and escalation can be avoided. The story at Northwestern University, just outside of Chicago, is entirely different to that of Northeastern. Its protest camp appeared on Thursday morning. University administrators responded by banning tents and calling in campus police. They stopped short of calling in state police and no arrests were made, and the campus officers eventually left. On Monday, administrators announced a deal: protesters were to be allowed to stay until the end of classes on 1 June if they remove tents and limit those taking part to students and others affiliated with the university. They stopped short of agreeing to stop investments in Israeli companies and arms manufacturers, but agreed to restart an investment committee and increase transparency over its approximately $13.7bn (£11bn) endowment. Northwestern also promised to fund places for two Palestinian faculty members and five Palestinian students. A truce appears to be holding - at least for now. Northwestern and Northeasten are both private colleges, and both in left-leaning, liberal states. So why were their responses to essentially the same situation and demands so different? Lauren Lassabe Shepherd, a historian at the University of New Orleans, said the pro-Palestine protests have not reached the fever pitch or level of violence seen during anti-war demonstrations in the 1960s and 70s - where some students were calling for the overthrow of the US government. She said that in some cases, however, calling in outside police forces had dramatically raised the stakes. ""Nearly all American universities have campus police, who are full-time, uniformed and can make arrests,"" she said. ""Calling in municipal police or National Guard troops is a high-risk strategy."" Scenes of police clashing with protesters have been splashed across social media, and outsiders and observers can also get caught up in the camp shutdowns. At Emory University in Atlanta, professors were among those arrested by city and state police last week, including Noelle McAfee, chair of the university's philosophy department. Ms McAfee told the BBC that she was observing what she described as a peaceful protest when police started to move in and the protesters began to move. She began filming police hitting a protester, she said, and noticed chemical irritants in the air. ""It was really disturbing. I started yelling 'stop it', and I was trying to take a video. One of the cops stood up and told me I need to step away… I froze in place."" She was then arrested. Hundreds of other arrests have been reported at universities all around the country, even as other disputes have been resolved without law enforcement. On Tuesday, protesters and administrators reached an agreement at Brown University, similar to Northwestern's, which promised to hold a vote on divestment from weapons manufacturers in the autumn. And a camp at University of California, Berkeley - the epicentre of the 1960s protest movement - has been both largely peaceful and left alone. Ken Paulson, director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University, said that political pressure, including from high-ranking members of Congress, had forced some administrators into potentially risky moves that in some cases have backfired. ""Increasingly, college presidents are trying to show Congress and the world that they're tough enough to be college presidents,"" he said. ""And that is so reminiscent of the late 60s, with lawmakers threatening college presidents and insisting that they cannot coddle anti-war student protesters."" The pressure can be more acute on leaders at private universities, he said, because publicly funded universities are obliged to provide students First Amendment protections. ""At private schools, they don't necessarily have to offer free speech rights,"" Mr Paulson said. ""So they can't tell legislators that their hands are tied and they can't do anything. They have to navigate these protests strictly with their own policies."" Time may be on the side of campus administrators. Mr Paulson said that most students are no part of the protests and are simply trying to get through the year, although graduation ceremonies could provide another protest target. Some universities have already cancelled commencement ceremonies or are considering doing so. If history is any guide, said Lauren Lassabe Shepherd, ""we are going to have an intense next week or two until the spring semester ends"".",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68909953,politics
260,Gaza: Israeli PM Netanyahu says Rafah attack will happen regardless of deal,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will launch an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah regardless of truce talks with Hamas. It comes amid ongoing attempts to try to reach an agreement for a ceasefire and hostage releases. But at a meeting of hostages' relatives, Mr Netanyahu said he would invade ""with or without"" a deal. His comments follow renewed warnings by the US against a Rafah invasion unless civilians were properly protected. In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Sunday, US President Joe Biden ""reiterated his clear position"" on Rafah, a White House statement said. Mr Biden has previously described an invasion of Rafah as a ""red line"". On Tuesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said an assault on Rafah would be an ""unbearable escalation"", appealing for ""all those with influence over Israel to do everything in their power to prevent it"". More than half of Gaza's 2.5m population is in Rafah, having fled there to escape fighting in other parts of the territory. Conditions in the overcrowded city are dire, and displaced people there have spoken of a lack of food, water and medication. The West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Monday that an invasion of Rafah would be the ""biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history"". Israeli sources told the Reuters news agency on Monday that plans to attack Rafah would be shelved in favour of a ""sustained period of calm"" if a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israeli was reached. Days earlier, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Channel 12 television that ""if there will be a deal, we will suspend the [Rafah] operation"". But on Tuesday Mr Netanyahu insisted that the war would continue until Israel had achieved all of its objectives in Rafah. ""The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question,"" he said. ""We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory,"" according to a statement issued by Mr Netanyahu's office. It said the families urged the prime minister and his national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, to continue the war and ignore mounting international pressure. Many hostage families however have publicly demonstrated for the government to agree to a deal to return their loved ones at any cost. About 130 hostages from among 253 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued. Indirect talks have been at an impasse for weeks, although the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said on Monday that he hoped Hamas would accept what he has called Israel's ""extraordinarily generous offer"" for a truce. Meanwhile the head of the UN's refugee organisation has warned that the looming invasion was causing people in Rafah to live in a state of ""constant traumatic stress disorder"". ""People have not yet been asked to evacuate from Rafah, but there is a sense that if there is no deal this week that could happen,"" Philippe Lazzarini told reporters. ""My colleagues on the ground are describing constant state of trauma among the people."" Mr Netanyahu also denounced as ""a scandal on a historical scale"" recent reports, citing Israeli officials, that the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague could be preparing to issue arrest warrants for Israeli government leaders and military commanders on charges related to the war. ""I want to make one thing clear: no decision, neither in The Hague nor anywhere else, will harm our determination to achieve all the goals of the war,"" the prime minister said. ""Israel expects the leaders of the free world to come out strongly against this scandalous step, a step that will harm the self-defence capacity not only of the State of Israel, but of all democracies in the world."" There has been no announcement from ICC Prosecutor Karim Kahn KC. However, his office has been formally investigating alleged war crimes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip since June 2014, and Mr Khan has confirmed that the investigation will cover the 7 October attack and the ensuing war. Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding treaty, and Mr Netanyahu insisted that the ICC had ""no authority"" over the country. However, the ICC ruled in 2015 that it had jurisdiction because the Palestinians had ratified the treaty. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that the US - which has also not ratified the Rome Statute - did not believe the court has jurisdiction and did not support the investigation.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68928996,politics
261,ICJ rules it will not halt German arms to Israel,"The International Court of Justice has ruled against issuing emergency orders to stop Germany's arms sales to Israel. Nicaragua brought the case, arguing that Germany had breached the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel. The German government said the lawsuit was unjustified. Berlin is a staunch ally of Israel and the second largest supplier of arms to the country after the US. A final ruling could take years. Today's decision was over emergency measures to be implemented swiftly. In 2023 some 30% of Israel's military equipment purchases came from Germany, totalling $326.5m (£257m) last year - a tenfold increase on 2022. Nicaragua said Germany's arms sales to Israel made it complicit in Israel's alleged war crimes. Israel has rejected accusations of genocide and says its actions in Gaza are focussed on destroying Hamas. The Central American country had brought the case to the Hague in early March to ask judges to issue emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance. It also said Germany had breached the UN genocide convention by ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency, UNRWA. Germany was one of 15 Western nations which suspended funding for UNRWA over allegations that some of the agency's staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel. Writing on X following the court's verdict, the German ministry of foreign affairs welcomed the decision and said Germany was ""not a party to the conflict in the Middle East"". It added that Germany was the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians and that it was working ""urgently"" to ensure that aid reaches the people of Gaza. Presiding Judge Nawaf Salam said the ICJ - which ruled 15-1 - remains ""deeply concerned about the catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip"". The court will now have to decide whether it has jurisdiction over the case. If so, it will then proceed to judge the case itself - which could take years. Nicaragua - a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause - likely decided to take Germany to court as Germany is the second-largest arms exporter to Israel. The US, which provides Israel with a much higher volume of weapons, does not recognise the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction. Critics of Nicaragua's case have highlighted the country's chequered human rights record. The government of President Daniel Ortega has jailed opponents and banned protests. In March, the UK's mission to the UN accused the government of a ""relentless"" crackdown on human rights.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68929873,politics
262,Images show US military building floating pier for Gaza aid,"The US military has published photos showing a floating pier being built in the Mediterranean Sea to help increase humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. Logistics vessels and personnel can be seen assembling the pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship. Costing about $320m (£255m), the pier and a causeway attached to the shore should be operational in a week. The goal is to deliver aid equivalent to as many as two million meals a day to Gaza to help avert a famine there. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May. ""Right now, you're seeing construction of that floating, temporary pier, and then, you'll start to see construction of the causeway,"" US defence department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters in Washington on Monday. ""Eventually, that causeway will be... pushed into the coastline and secured by the [Israel Defense Forces],"" she added. The pier will be ready a week from now, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. The UN has said a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed. Satellite images published by Planet Labs meanwhile appeared to show the pier was being built next to the USNS Benavidez, a Military Sealift Command roll-on/roll-off ship, 11km (7 miles) north-west of the coast of northern Gaza. A senior US military official said last week that the Israeli military's security role meant ""no US boots will be on the ground"" as part of the mission to construct and operate what is known officially as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS. An unnamed ""third party"" would also be driving aid lorries down the causeway, the official added. Hundreds of sailors and soldiers involved in the operation will live and sleep aboard a British Navy logistical support ship, RFA Cardigan Bay, which has been deployed to the area. On Saturday, the IDF confirmed that the Israeli Navy would ""secure the forces"" operating the pier and said it was ""committed to increasing the amount of humanitarian aid transferred daily into Gaza"". A senior Hamas official told the Associated Press last week that the group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the US - rejected ""any non-Palestinian presence in Gaza, whether at sea or on land"" and would ""deal with any military force present in these places… as an occupying power"". He spoke a day after Israel said ""terrorists"" had fired mortars at the site during a visit by UN personnel. No injuries were reported. The IDF also released photos and videos of what it described as the ""extensive preparations"" being carried out by its forces at a 67 acre (0.27 sq km) holding area where aid from the floating pier will be brought. The site is just inland from the makeshift jetty built by the US charity World Central Kitchen in March for a maritime corridor that was suspended after seven of its aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike. The US military official said the floating pier should be able to handle about 90 lorry loads of aid per day initially, and then quickly scale up to about 150 lorry loads. A lorry can typically carry about 20 tonnes of supplies. The UN has blamed the severe food shortage on Israeli restrictions on deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order. On Friday, the UN said a daily average of 192 aid lorries entered Gaza during April via the Egyptian-controlled Rafah and Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossings, which are in southern Gaza. The figure did not cover two recently-opened Israeli-controlled entry points in central and northern Gaza. Israeli defence ministry body Cogat said an average of 350 lorries entered Gaza daily through all crossings in the week beginning 7 April. It has insisted that Israel is not limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68927001,politics
263,Somerset Council says paint-protest clean-up will cost it £20k,"A local authority says it expects to spend about £20,000 cleaning red paint from the front of its head office. The Grade II-listed A-block of County Hall in Taunton has had paint thrown at it three times in the past two months. Protesters want Somerset Council to evict a defence firm with connections to Israel from one of its commercial buildings in Bristol. The company supplies the British military but said nothing is sent to Israel from its Bristol site. The cost of cleaning up the first two paint protests, which the council said required specialist attention as it was a Grade II-listed building, was £13,300 excluding VAT and any internal staffing costs. Paint from the most recent protest has not been cleaned off yet, but the council said it estimated it would spend £20,000 in total on cleaning and restoring the building. Somerset Council has faced repeated pressure from protesters over its links with Elbit Systems UK, which is a tenant of a building the council owns in Bristol. The Aztec West 600 building makes up part of the council's commercial portfolio, which it is in the process of selling off. Elbit Systems UK is a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd that is based in Israel. Last week a motion was passed by councillors to explore legal routes to remove Elbit Systems UK as a tenant. The council was later forced to apologise to the arms firm for incorrectly suggesting in a motion that it provided weapons to Israel's military. The council said: ""Elbit Systems UK Limited have contacted us to say this is factually incorrect and they do not supply weapons or military equipment to the Israeli Defence Forces or the Israeli Ministry of Defence. ""The council would like to apologise and withdraw the statement that Elbit Systems UK Limited supplies military equipment to the Israeli Defence Forces or the Israeli Ministry of Defence."" Following the vote last week, Elbit Systems UK issued a statement saying it provided equipment to the British army and that ""nothing from the Aztec site goes to the IDF"", branding any direct links with Israel as ""grossly misleading"". A spokesman said: ""We continue to invest and expand our range of services in the United Kingdom, providing critical support and advanced technology to the British Armed Forces from Aztec West 600 and other sites across the country.""",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-68922397,politics
264,Columbia protesters take over building after defying deadline,"Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University have escalated their protest over the war in Gaza by occupying an academic building. Activists at the university in New York City seized Hamilton Hall early on Tuesday, barricading themselves inside. One student said the campus was ""lawless"", as officials grapple with the long-running demo which has prompted a wave of rallies elsewhere. Columbia has urged students and staff to stay away from campus on Tuesday. It earlier began suspending students who defied Monday's deadline of 14:00 EST (18:00 GMT) to leave their two-week encampment nearby. But as the deadline passed, dozens of students rallied at the site. Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), one of the main protest groups, vowed to defy the order in a post on X, and called on activists to ""protect the encampment"". The group later announced the takeover of Hamilton Hall, highlighting that the venue was also the focus of student protests in 1968. Another group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), said it had ""reclaimed"" the building in honour of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old girl found dead in Gaza earlier this year. One student described the campus as ""lawless, utter anarchy"", with demonstrators breaking the building's windows to enter, before blocking the doors with furniture. Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Jessica Schwalb said the group had entered with ""bags full of stuff"", adding: ""I'm guessing they're going to be living in there indefinitely."" Demonstrations have rocked campuses across the US in recent weeks, sparked by New York police clearing an earlier encampment at Columbia. Hundreds of people have been arrested across the country - among them dozens of protesters at the University of Texas at Austin on Monday. Officials there said protesters had ignored directions to take down their tents and that ""baseball-size rocks"" had been found in the encampment. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has voiced his concern that some law enforcement actions witnessed on American campuses have been ""disproportionate in their impacts"". ""Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society,"" he added in a statement. At Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, students said police used tear gas and pepper spray against their gathering on Monday. The university said the group had been ""repeatedly"" asked to leave, and echoed other institutions by saying many of those involved in the demonstration were not students. Elsewhere, there has been a rare agreement reached in Evanston, Illinois, between Northwestern University and protesters who have camped out for days in solidarity with the Palestinians. Under the deal, the university said it would permit ""peaceful demonstrations"", provided the encampment was limited to a single tent. Activists across the US are demanding that their universities, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties. Pressure has been building on the leadership of Columbia - an elite Ivy League university in Upper Manhattan - to act, or step aside. Posting on X before the occupation of Hamilton Hall, US House Speaker Mike Johnson labelled the scenes at Columbia an ""utter disgrace"" and called on the university's president to step down. Columbia's campus has become the focal point of the country's debate over the war in Gaza and US support for Israel, as well as fears that antisemitism is putting Jewish students in danger. Earlier on Monday, a group of House Democrats urged its board of trustees to resign if it could not ""act decisively, disband the encampment, and ensure the safety and security of all of its students"". Annual tuition and fees for Columbia add up to around $90,000 (£72,000) for undergraduates, making it one of the most expensive universities in the US. More than 100 people were arrested when police raided the earlier encampment on 18 April. But activists redoubled their efforts, regrouping in another encampment and prompting university leadership to move to hybrid learning. A statement on Monday from Columbia's president, Dr Minouche Shafik, reiterated that the university ""will not divest from Israel"", and that talks between academic leaders and student organisers had failed to result in an agreement. Several hours after the deadline passed for students to take down their camp - and before the break-in at Hamilton Hall was reported - another official said the university had started to suspend students. This makes them ineligible to graduate. Officials say they want to avoid any disruption to graduation ceremonies on 15 May. Another of the protesters' demands is amnesty for activists who face disciplinary action from the university. For now, the cluster of tents remains in place. Mahmoud Khalil, one of the students who has been negotiating with Columbia officials, told the BBC that protesters believed it was ""highly probable"" that police would again be called in again. ""The students are here,"" added Mr Khalil, who said he was a Palestinian refugee who grew up in Syria. ""They are holding their ground."" Many wore face coverings, telling the BBC they were worried about being recognised and facing recrimination. But the university wrote in its letter on Monday that it had already identified several participants. The BBC is tracking protests or encampments on campuses in at least 22 other states and Washington DC. They have also been reported in Canada, France and Australia. Jewish students on numerous campuses have voiced concern about their safety, amid alleged incidents of harassment and threats of violence by some protests participants, The White House is walking an increasingly fine line over the campus protests, seeking to balance the right to peaceful protest with condemnation of hate speech. ""It is a painful moment, we get that,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Declining to say how university leadership should act, she added: ""Free expression has to be done within the law."" Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have also highlighted antisemitic chants and incidents at the protests.",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68923528,politics
265,US says Israeli army units violated human rights,"The US state department has found five units of the Israeli military responsible for gross violations of human rights in individual incidents, but says they will continue to receive US military backing. All the incidents involved took place outside of Gaza before the current war. Israel took corrective action in four units, giving ""additional information"" on the fifth, the department says. This means all the units remain eligible for US military assistance. Washington is Israel's major military backer, supplying it with $3.8bn (£3bn) worth of weapons and defence systems per year. The announcement is the first determination of its kind for any Israeli unit by the US government. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said five security forces units committed gross violations of human rights. ""Four of these units have effectively remediated these violations, which is what we expect partners to do,"" he said. ""For a remaining unit, we continue to be in consultations and engagements with the government of Israel; they have submitted additional information as it pertains to that unit,"" he added. The department denies claims it backed down under political pressure by continuing military assistance to the unit despite being unable to say whether or not there had been any accountability in the case. ""We are engaging with them in a process, and we will make an ultimate decision when it comes to that unit when that process is complete,"" said Mr Patel. All the incidents are believed to have taken place in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem in recent years. Under America's ""Leahy Law"", sponsored in 1997 by then-Senator Patrick Leahy, a finding that a foreign military unit committed gross violations of human rights means it can be cut from receiving US military assistance. The US government says it considers torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance and rape as such types of violations when implementing the Leahy law. Even when there is such a finding, there is an exception to cutting military assistance if the state department is satisfied the cases have been dealt with and justice pursued by the government involved. It says Israel did do this - so-called remediation - in four of the five units. However, the department declined to give any details of the incidents, the remediation, the units involved or evidence to support whether the remediation was effective. The US was reportedly on the brink of announcing it would cut military aid to the fifth unit, but says new information from Israel means it will make a decision later. The unit involved is widely reported to be the Netzah Yehuda battalion, a special men-only unit set up in 1999 where ultra-Orthodox Jews serve. Israel investigated the battalion over the death of 80-year-old Palestinian-American Omar Assad who died after being bound and gagged by soldiers during a West Bank village search in 2022. At the time the US called for a ""thorough criminal investigation and full accountability"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later said they regretted Mr Assad's death, and a commander would be ""reprimanded"" and two soldiers barred from senior positions for two years - but would not be prosecuted. Asked about reports an IDF unit would be the first ever to face the US government designation under the Leahy Law, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on 19 April: ""I made determinations. You can expect to see them in the days ahead."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to reject any sanctions on the country's military , saying he would ""fight it with all my strength"", while Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and war cabinet minister Benny Gantz spoke on the phone to Mr Blinken. Pressed by the BBC on Monday over whether the state department had delayed or softened its position on withdrawing military assistance to the fifth unit, Mr Patel said officials would make a decision when their consultations with the Israeli government were complete.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68925495,politics
266,Gaza war: US 'hopeful' Hamas will accept Israel's new ceasefire offer,"The US secretary of state hopes Hamas will accept what he has called Israel's ""extraordinarily generous"" offer for a Gaza truce and hostage release deal. Antony Blinken was speaking as a Hamas delegation discussed the new proposal with mediators from Egypt and Qatar. A source close to the talks told the BBC they were cautiously optimistic. The proposal includes a 40-day truce in return for the release of hostages and the prospect of displaced families being allowed back to northern Gaza. It reportedly also involves new wording on restoring calm meant to satisfy Hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire. The Hamas delegation has now left Cairo and will return with a written response to the proposal, Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera TV said. The Israeli government is coming under growing pressure from its global allies and the families of the hostages to agree a deal. Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,480 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US have been attempting for weeks to broker a new agreement that would secure another pause in the fighting and the release of the 133 hostages who Israel says are still being held, at least 30 of whom are presumed dead. Earlier this month, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week truce and the release of 40 women, children and elderly or sick hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas said it was sticking to its demands for a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes. The source close to the talks in Cairo told the BBC that the new proposal from Israel was significantly different from previous offers. On Saturday, the Axios news website cited Israeli officials as saying the proposal included a willingness for the return of people to northern Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the east-west corridor that divides the territory and prevents freedom of movement. It also included a willingness to ""discuss the establishment of a sustainable ceasefire as part of the implementation of the second phase of the deal"", the officials said. Israeli officials and a diplomat meanwhile told the New York Times and Financial Times on Monday that Israel was also prepared to reduce the number of hostages released during the first phase to 33, down from 40. Hamas has only said publicly that it is studying the new Israeli proposal, but an unnamed senior official told AFP news agency on Sunday that ""the atmosphere is positive unless there are new Israeli obstacles"". ""There are no major issues in the observations and inquiries submitted by Hamas regarding the contents [of the proposal],"" they added. Mr Blinken also expressed optimism at a meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Riyadh, which was attended by several of his European and Arab counterparts. ""Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous, on the part of Israel. And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas,"" he said. ""They have to decide, and they have to decide quickly... And I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."" Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, whose country is a mediator in the Israel-Hamas negotiations along with Qatar, also said he was ""hopeful"". ""The proposal has taken into account the positions of both sides and has tried to extract moderation,"" he said. ""There are factors that will have an impact on both sides' decisions, but I hope that all will rise to the occasion."" Sunday's phone call between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have focused on the negotiations. They also discussed the need to sustain a recent increase in aid reaching Gaza and continued US opposition to a full-scale offensive on the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering. Local medics and rescuers said at least 22 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on three homes in Rafah overnight. ""We demand the entire world calls for a lasting truce. This is enough,"" a man called Abu Taha told AFP at al-Najjar hospital, as a crowd of relatives mourned over the shrouded bodies. There was no immediate comment on the reports from the Israeli military. Meanwhile, children in Rafah told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today radio programme that rising temperatures were making life unbearable in the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters erected there. ""Being inside the tent does not protect me from the intense heat; it is as if I am standing directly under sun's rays,"" said Sarah Abu Amr, 11. ""There is no electricity to power fans or get cold water to ease the terrible effect of the heat, and there is no food, water, or anything at all to keep us hydrated."" Last week, when temperatures reached 40C (104F), a five-month-old girl reportedly died in a tent due to the extreme heat, according to the UN . Over the weekend, there were further indications from senior Israeli generals that plans were being finalised for a major operation in Rafah, where the military says Hamas's remaining battalions and leaders are based. But Mr Blinken - who is due to fly from Saudi Arabia to Jordan and Israel - noted that the US had ""not yet seen a plan that gives us confidence that civilians can be effectively protected"". Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas - a rival of Hamas who is based in the occupied West Bank - said on Sunday that the US was the only country capable of preventing an assault on Rafah, which he warned would cause ""the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people"". Israeli Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that Israel's military would ""suspend the operation"" in Rafah if a hostage release deal was agreed. But far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich warned Mr Netanyahu not to cancel the Rafah assault, saying that if he failed to destroy Hamas ""the government headed by you will have no right to exist"".",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68920131,politics
267,Minister warned against 'insane' UK troop deployment in Gaza,"The UK government has been urged not to deploy troops on the ground in Gaza to deliver aid, with one MP calling the idea ""completely insane"". The UK is understood to be considering tasking troops with driving trucks via an American-built floating pier onto a beach in Gaza. Ex-Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said such a move would be ""unwise"" and urged the government to rule it out. Defence Minister Leo Docherty said he would not comment on speculation. The US military is building a large floating causeway off the coast of Gaza to help deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the area. In a briefing to journalists, a senior US military official said American troops would not take the aid ashore and that this role would be carried out by a ""significant partner"". He confirmed the job would be carried out by another nation rather than a private military company. The official said a ""third party"" would be driving trucks down the pier but refused to name who that would be. The Ministry of Defence has declined to comment on suggestions the third party could be UK forces. One UK source told the BBC nothing had been decided but there was a debate going on about ""do we put wet boots on the beach, do we drive trucks onto the pier?"" On Monday, Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey used an urgent question in Parliament to ask the minister if he could confirm ""weekend reports that UK troops could be deployed to deliver aid on the ground in Gaza"". ""How will the defence secretary report to this house and ensure that Parliament has a say on any such deployment?"" Mr Docherty said the government was ""not going to comment on the speculation that there might be a ground role for UK forces"". Tory MP Sir Julian Lewis, chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it would be a ""completely insane idea"" and argued a better option would be for ""moderate Arab neighbouring states"" to distribute the aid. Defence Committee Chair Sir Jeremy Quin said he understood the minister could not comment but warned that ""some of the best laid, best intentioned of plans can run into problems"". He sought assurances that the UK would only contemplate ""UK boots on the pier"" if ""appropriate"" protection was in place. The Liberal Democrat's defence spokesperson Richard Foord said that if UK troops were deployed in Gaza, MPs should first be given a debate and vote on the subject. Former Labour leader - now an independent MP - Jeremy Corbyn asked the government to assure MPs the government will ""not be deploying British troops anywhere on the ground in Gaza or the West Bank or any other part of the region"". US defence officials say the pier into Gaza would be ""several hundred meters long"" and could ultimately enable up to 150 trucks of aid, or two million meals, to be deliver per day. More than 1,000 US troops are expected to be involved in building the infrastructure, expected to be completed by early May. During construction, the American soldiers and sailors will live and sleep aboard the British naval vessel, the RFA Cardigan Bay. The UN has warned famine is ""almost inevitable"" in Gaza without urgent action. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began on 7 October. The  Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched the offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 253 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68923811,politics
268,US campus protests: Rival Gaza protest groups clash at UCLA,"Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups have clashed at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as demonstrations over the war in Gaza continue across US campuses. Nationwide rallies - during which there have been hundreds of arrests - showed no sign of stopping over the weekend. At UCLA ""physical altercations broke out"" after a barrier separating the two sides was breached, an official said. The White House has insisted that demonstrations must remain peaceful. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told ABC that the US government respects the right of protesters demonstrating over the Israel-Gaza war. But he condemned antisemitic incidents that have been reported, as well as ""all the hate speech and the threats of violence out there"". At UCLA, a pro-Palestinian encampment has grown in size in recent days, as has a group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters. The Israeli American Council (IAC) organised the counter-protest. It recently said it had ""profound concern"" over the antisemitism reported elsewhere, including at Columbia University in New York City. Many pro-Palestinian protesters who spoke to the BBC there sought to distance themselves from antisemitic incidents. In some cases they have blamed outside agitators. A group of 21 Democratic members of Congress has called on Columbia to end what they call the ""unauthorized and impermissible encampment of anti-Israel, anti-Jewish activists on campus"", in a letter obtained by Axios. Similar calls for action had largely come from the Republican side of the political divide. In a fresh statement on Monday, Columbia head Dr Minouche Shafik said ""alternative internal options to end this crisis"" were under discussion, after talks between protest organisers and the university failed to result in a deal. At least some of the protesters involved in the disturbances at UCLA appeared to have come from outside the university, the Reuters news agency reported. The two groups remained peaceful until Sunday, when campus police with batons separated them as they pushed and shoved each other, and traded punches. It was not immediately clear which group broke through the barrier between them. ""We are heartbroken about the violence that broke out,"" the university said, adding that additional security measures had been introduced. Tensions flared at US universities after the 7 October Hamas attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed in Israel, and the retaliatory Israeli military assault that has killed more than 34,000 people in Gaza. In the last fortnight, a nationwide uprising has emerged which university officials and law enforcement have struggled to contain. They have blamed outside groups for infiltrating the demos. The movement seems to have been emboldened by the arrest of more than 100 protesters at Columbia after police were called to clear an encampment. Hundreds of people have since been arrested in locations across the US - many of whom had pitched their own tents on university grounds. The protests have also spread to Canada, with a pro-Palestinian camp of about 20 tents now installed in the grounds of Montreal's McGill University. Activists in both countries are demanding a ceasefire in the conflict, and that their universities - many with massive endowments - cut their financial ties, or divest, from Israel. They say that companies doing business in or with the nation of Israel are complicit in its ongoing war on Gaza - and so are institutions that invest in those companies. Officials in the US have also scrambled to tackle alleged incidents of antisemitism, with a number of Jewish students voicing fears for their safety. At several campuses, they have spoken of incidents ranging from chants and signs supporting Hamas - a proscribed terror group in the US - to physical altercations and perceived threats. Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, reported ""virulent antisemitic slurs"" in a statement on Saturday that accused ""professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern"" of infiltrating a student protest. More than 100 people were detained, it added. In other recent developments:",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68919182,politics
269,BBC Gaza correspondent: My struggle to keep family safe while covering the war,"For about three months, Adnan El-Bursh reported on the war in Gaza while living in a tent, eating one meal a day, and struggling to keep his wife and five children safe. The BBC Arabic correspondent shares the harrowing moments he faced covering a war that pushed him to his limits. Warning: This report contains descriptions and images some readers may find distressing One of the worst moments of the past six months was the night we all slept on the street. I looked at the faces of my wife and children, huddled in the bitter cold in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and felt helpless. My 19-year-old twins, Zakia and Batoul, lay on the pavement alongside my daughter, Yumna, who is 14, my son Mohamed, who is eight and my youngest girl, Razan, aged five, with their mother, Zaynab. As we tried to rest outside the Palestinian Red Crescent Society's headquarters, the sounds of shelling echoed through the night and drones buzzed overhead. We had managed to find an apartment to rent, but the landlord had called earlier that day, saying the Israeli military had warned him the building would be bombed. I was working at the time, but my family grabbed their bags and fled. We met up at the Red Crescent headquarters, which was already overflowing with displaced people. My brother and I sat on cardboard boxes all night, discussing what we should do. We had fled our homes in the town of Jabalia a few days earlier, on 13 October, leaving most of our possessions behind, after the Israeli military told everyone in northern Gaza to move south for safety. And now we had just escaped being bombed in the area we had been told to move to. It was hard to think straight. I felt angry, humiliated and terrible that I could not provide any protection for my family. Eventually, my family moved to an apartment in Nuseirat in central Gaza, while I stayed with the BBC team in a tent at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. I visited every few days. Communication was difficult, with internet and phone signals sometimes cut. Once I did not hear from my family for four or five days. In Khan Younis, the BBC team - about seven of us - lived on one meal a day. Even when there was food, sometimes we did not eat it because there was hardly anywhere to go to the toilet. During this time my friend, Al Jazeera bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, suffered a terrible loss. The house his family had been staying in was hit in an Israeli air strike. His wife, teenage son, seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed. The Israeli military says it takes ""feasible precautions"" to reduce civilian casualties, and in this case had ""targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area"". Reporting Gaza: My War In Gaza, Palestinian journalists document the war as they live it on a daily basis. In this BBC World Service film, we hear the story of BBC Arabic's Reporter in Gaza, Adnan El-Bursh who found himself reporting the news, as he was living through it. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK) I watched the footage of my friend, who I have known for 20 years, embracing his children's shroud-wrapped bodies in central Gaza. I wished I was there with him. The news came amid a string of reports about the deaths of other friends, relatives and neighbours. My heart ached. I have now lost about 200 people in the war. That day I wept live on air, as I was reporting. In the night, I woke up with tears covering my cheeks. Wael's image never left my mind. I have covered conflicts in Gaza for 15 years, but this war stands apart, from the unprecedented attack that triggered it, to the scale of the losses. At 06:15 on 7 October I was woken by loud explosions and my children screaming. I went up to the rooftop and saw rockets being launched towards Israel from Gaza. When we realised Hamas had breached the fence into Israel - in its assault that saw about 1,200 people killed and 250 taken hostage - we knew the response from Israel would be like nothing we had seen before. More than 34,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The risk of injury and death has been ever-present. Two days into the war, I hurried to our local market in Jabalia, to stock up with food. It was busy with others doing the same. But the area was bombed heavily just 10 minutes after I left. The entire place was destroyed, including the large grocery store where I had shopped moments earlier. I knew the faces of the shop owners. Many of them were among the dead. Amnesty International says at least 69 people were killed in the attack and that it should be investigated as a war crime. The Israeli military has not responded to the BBC's question about this incident. Throughout the war it has said its operation is targeting Hamas, which it says operates from civilian locations. It also says ""strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law"". Before the war, Jabalia was a beautiful, tranquil town. I was born there and had been living a simple, contented life with my family, filled with love and plans for the future. I had a farm east of the town, where I had planted olive, lemon, and orange trees with my own hands. It was peaceful and I loved to drink tea there after work. The day we decided to flee northern Gaza for Khan Younis - leaving our homes and the BBC office in Gaza City behind - was a pivotal moment in my life. With more than 10 people crammed into one car, my family and I crawled our way south, along a single road, with tens of thousands of other people, on foot and in vehicles, all loaded with belongings. The journey was punctuated by air strikes on nearby areas on both sides of the road. Confusion, grief and uncertainty marked the faces of my family and the crowds. The children kept asking me: ""Where are we going? Will we be back tomorrow?"" I really wish I had taken our photo album, full of pictures of me as a young child, my parents, and my wife and I when we got engaged. My dad was an Arabic teacher and I also wish I had taken some of his books that I kept after he died. Later, I learned from a neighbour that my house had been completely destroyed, and my farm burned. After that terrifying and surreal journey south, and our night outside the Red Crescent headquarters, I continued working from Khan Younis for several weeks. My family were still in Nuseirat and being separated from them took a toll emotionally. Then, in early December, Israel began telling Gazans to leave parts of Khan Younis and move to other areas, including Rafah, further south. The Israeli military also closed the main road leading north, which connected me and my family. I did not know how I would get to them or where we should go if I did. Rafah was already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of people, and there was barely anywhere to stay. For days, I grappled with swirling emotions. News circulated about Israeli forces advancing towards the main roads, apparently aiming to divide the south from the central and northern regions.  I was terrified that I - or my family - would be killed and we would never see each other again. For the first time I felt like I had lost it. I did not even know what day it was. I considered stopping work and returning to my family. If we died, we would die together. In the end, on 11 December, I drove with a colleague along a back road to Nuseirat. When I arrived, my youngest children rushed up to hug me, with Razan reaching round my neck and holding on tight. We managed to move the family to Rafah. The BBC team had also relocated there, continuing to report. There were some awful moments. In late December, I reported as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) handed about 80 bodies to the authorities in Gaza. The IDF said it had taken them from Gaza to Israel so they could be checked to see if there were any hostages among them. A large lorry drove into the cemetery in the Rafah area. The stench was overwhelming when the container was opened. Men in aprons and masks placed the remains, wrapped in blue plastic, in a mass grave dug by an excavator in the sandy ground. I had never seen a scene like that before. It is hard to describe how horrible it was. Then, in January, I was reporting from a hospital in Rafah when several bodies were brought in, including another of Wael Al-Dahdouh's sons, Hamza, his eldest, who was also a journalist working for Al Jazeera. Who would tell Wael? It just seemed impossible, after the tragedies he had already faced. I could not even listen as one of my colleagues called someone close to Wael to pass on the news. Hamza and his colleague, freelance videographer Mustafa Thuraya, were killed in an Israeli air strike on their car, after they had reported on the aftermath of another strike in the area. The Israeli military alleges they were ""members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations"". The families and Al Jazeera reject the claims as false. The IDF says the two were operating drones ""posing an imminent threat to IDF troops"", but a Washington Post investigation ""found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day"". More than 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to Reporters Without Borders - the vast majority are known to be Palestinian. The IDF says it ""has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists"". It says it ""takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists"", but ""remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks"". Eventually, the news came that the BBC team's families had permission to leave Gaza. Four weeks later, we too finally left through the Rafah crossing, facilitated by the Egyptian authorities. I am writing this in Qatar. But I know that in Jabalia, they have been pulling up grass and grinding animal feed to eat, while I'm here having meals in a clean hotel. I find it hard to eat - it's like eating poison. The future is a blur. Gaza is my life. I want to return one day, but for now, that seems impossible.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68906903,politics
270,Palestinian leader appeals to US to stop Israel's Rafah offensive,"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the US is the only country that can stop Israel from attacking Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than a million people are taking refuge. Mr Abbas, who runs parts of the occupied West Bank, said any attack could see Palestinians flee Gaza. Israel has consistently vowed to carry out an offensive in Rafah. US President Joe Biden ""reiterated his clear position"" on Rafah to Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a call on Sunday. The US has repeatedly said it cannot support a large-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah without seeing a credible plan to keep civilians out of harm's way. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Saudi capital Riyadh earlier, Mr Abbas - whose Palestinian Authority is not present in Gaza, which has been under Hamas rule since 2007 - urged the US to intervene. ""We appeal to the United States of America to ask Israel to stop the Rafah operation because America is the only country capable of preventing Israel from committing this crime,"" he said, adding that only a ""small strike"" on Rafah would force the Palestinian population to flee the Gaza strip. ""The biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history would then happen."" More than half of Gaza's population is in Rafah and conditions in the overcrowded southern city are already dire, with displaced people there telling the BBC there was a lack of food, water and medication. While the White House did not elaborate on what specifically Mr Biden's latest comments to Mr Netanyahu were regarding the planning offensive in Rafah, national security spokesman John Kirby told the ABC network that Israel had agreed to listen to US concerns and thoughts before going in. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Riyadh where he will hold talks with Mr Abbas at the start of a new Middle East tour. Meanwhile, the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a potential ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza, which have gained new momentum recently, have been further exposing divisions in Israel's governing coalition. War cabinet member and opposition figure Benny Gantz on Sunday said that the current government ""would not have the right to continue to exist"" if a reasonable deal to return the hostages was not accepted. ""Entering Rafah is important in the long struggle against Hamas. The return of our abductees, is urgent and of far greater importance,"" Mr Gantz wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, however, said the government should resign if it accepted a deal in which the planned offensive in Rafah was cancelled. Their comments come after Israel's foreign minister said that the country could suspend the incursion, which Mr Netanyahu has said is the next step in its battle against Hamas, if there was a hostage deal. The Israeli military said its chief Herzi Halevi had approved plans to continue the war, with Israeli media saying this referred to the Rafah operation. Long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar have largely stalled because of the gaps between the Israeli and Hamas positions, but on Sunday Hamas said it would send representatives to Cairo to give a response to the latest proposal. US media have quoted unnamed Egyptian officials as saying the latest ceasefire proposal given to Hamas involved a several-week period of calm intended to lead to the end of the war, in return for the release of 20 hostages. Hamas wants a permanent end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, while Israel insists Hamas must be destroyed in Gaza and all hostages freed. Egypt and other Arab states have previously said an influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war would be unacceptable because it would amount to the expulsion of Palestinians from their land. Satellite pictures have shown new tent encampments being built near the Gaza coast, to the west of Rafah and the city of Khan Younis slightly further north, which has been left largely in ruins. Media reports say the tents are to accommodate people displaced from Rafah. The current war began when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. Some 133 hostages are believed still to be in Gaza, of whom about 30 are thought to be dead, after a brief truce in November saw some hostages released. This week Hamas's armed wing released two videos showing the first proof of life of three hostages since they were abducted last October. Israel's campaign of aerial bombardment and ground operations in Gaza since 7 October has killed 34,454 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Over the six months of war, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have entered and taken control of all of northern Gaza including Gaza City and most of central and southern Gaza including Khan Younis. They have since withdrawn from almost all of those areas but troops remain stationed on a road Israel has built that separates northern and southern Gaza. However, Palestinians displaced to southern Gaza - where the Israeli military told them to go for their own safety earlier in the war - have been unable to return to homes further north, a key demand Hamas is making in ceasefire talks, and Israel has given no indication when they will be allowed to. Meanwhile, deadly Israeli bombardment has continued across Gaza, including in Rafah, with the Israeli military saying it has been striking launch sites for projectiles.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68916315,politics
271,Apology over Green candidate's anti-Semitic post,"A Green Party candidate who shared anti-Semitic material relating to the Gaza conflict on social media has apologised, the party has said. The party was contacted by the government's anti-Semitism adviser, Lord Mann, over posts by Bristol candidates Mohamed Makawi and Abdul Malik from October 2023. One of the posts showed part of a Hamas press conference, while the other made false claims about the killing of Israeli citizens. The Green Party said Mr Makawi had has since apologised and undertaken social media training, while Mr Malik was ""unwittingly"" implicated by being tagged in the post. The posts followed the Hamas attack on 7 October , when waves of gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Mr Malik told the BBC he did not put up the post showing Hamas spokesmen and said he completely condemns the attacks on Israel. Mr Makawi has also been approached for comment. Meanwhile Lord Mann, who wrote to the party's co-leaders about the allegations, has criticised the Green Party for taking so long to respond. He said he was ""disappointed"" the Greens only responded to his letter, which was sent on 5 April, three weeks later, after the BBC contacted the party. ""I'm a little puzzled,"" he said. ""The Green Party has created a bigger problem for itself by not responding immediately."" A Green Party spokesperson said it has responded to Lord Mann with ""evidence of the actions we have taken to remove these ill-judged and offensive communications"" and offered to meet him to continue discussions. ""In one case, it appears the candidate was unwittingly tagged into an offensive post that he assures us he did not himself publish,"" they said. ""He deleted this post from his timeline as soon as we made him aware of it. ""In the other case, the candidate gave credence to some egregious misinformation by sharing it online. He has since apologised and undertaken social media training. ""In our response to Lord Mann we also reiterated that the Green Party has repeatedly condemned the appalling Hamas attacks of 7th October, and called for the unconditional release of Israeli hostages, as well as calling for a bilateral ceasefire.""

272,World Central Kitchen to resume aid in Gaza following fatal airstrike,"World Central Kitchen is to resume distributing food in Gaza, nearly a month after seven of its aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike. The aid organisation said it has 276 trucks with eight million meals ready to enter through the Rafah crossing. ""Ultimately, we decided we must keep feeding,"" the charity said on Sunday. Earlier this month, the charity said a convoy leaving a warehouse was attacked by Israel killing seven and sparking an international outcry . The Israel Defense Forces admitted ""grave mistakes"" led to the fatal strike against the workers and dismissed two senior officers over the incident. In a statement on Sunday, WCK CEO Erin Gore said: ""The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. ""We are restarting our operation with the same energy, dignity, and focus on feeding as many people as possible."" The charity said it will also send trucks from Jordan and use the Ashdod Port, one of Israel's three main cargo ports, as well as build a third high production kitchen in Gaza. Speaking on the fatal airstrike, the charity said it was continuing to call for an impartial and international investigation into the deaths of the aid workers , which included three Britons, a Palestinian, Australian, Pole and US-Canadian citizen. ""While we have no concrete assurances, we continue to seek answers and advocate for change with the goal of better protecting WCK and all NGO workers serving selflessly in the worst humanitarian conditions,"" Ms Gore said. WCK is one of the main suppliers of desperately-needed aid into Gaza and says it has supplied more than 43 million meals in Gaza since the war started in October. Talking about the decision to resume operations, Ms Gore added: ""We decided that we must keep feeding, continuing our mission of showing up to provide food to people during the toughest of times."" In the space of four minutes on 1 April, the seven aid workers were killed when three missiles destroyed their cars one by one as they engaged in humanitarian work. The charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The IDF said a series of mistakes and miscommunications resulted in them being mistaken for Hamas operatives and targeted. Israel's military said a ""number of armed gunmen"" were in the vicinity of the convoy, but drone operators wrongly tracked cars carrying aid workers. The army apologised after admitting its soldiers did not follow protocols and were not given crucial information about the pre-approved aid mission. The WCK announcement comes as Israeli's military said the amount of aid going into Gaza will be ramped up in the coming days to help . Spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said in a statement: ""Food, water, medical supplies, shelter equipment and other aid - more of it is going into Gaza than ever before."" Israel is also working with US Central Command to construct a ""temporary maritime pier,"" which will allow ship-to-shore distribution, he added. The UN has warned that famine in the Gaza Strip is ""almost inevitable"" and children are starving to death. The current war began when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent campaign of aerial bombardment and ground operations in Gaza has killed 34,454 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68915931,politics

""The mom just told me with just a blank numb stare on her face that he had just died five minutes prior. The staff had been trying to cover up his body with blankets but she just refused to let them. She wanted to spend more time with him. She was grieving, she was sobbing, and stayed that way for about a good 20 minutes, she just didn't want to  leave his side."" Then there was the man in his 50s, forgotten in a room, having had both legs amputated. ""He had lost his kids, his grandkids, his home,"" Sam recalls, ""and he's alone in the corner of this dark hospital, maggots going out of his wounds and he was screaming: 'The worms are eating me alive please help me.' That was just one just one out of… I don't know, I just I stopped counting. But those are the people I still think of because they're still there."" Sam is a sensitive, thoughtful man in his 40s, the son of two doctors, who was born and raised in Chicago and who works as a surgeon at Northwestern hospital in the city. While in Gaza he kept video diaries and filmed his experiences. For two weeks in March and April - on behalf of the NGO Palestinian American Bridge - he worked in Gaza hospitals that were desperately short of everything except badly-wounded patients. On the day he entered Gaza this time around he was immediately confronted with the hunger crisis. ""We were just swarmed by people banging on the cars, some people trying to jump on the cars. The drivers… they just got it. They don't stop because if they stopped then people jump on the cars. They're not trying to harm us. They're just begging for food. They're starving."" Sam recounts his experiences calmly, as you might expect of a man trained to put patients at ease.  Every day there was the relentless pressure of carrying out triage, deciding who could be saved, who was beyond hope. Patients lying on hospital floors surrounded by blood and discarded bandages, the air filled with the cries of pain and of grieving relatives. There is no erasing such horrors. Even if you are a highly trained doctor with past experience of war zones like Ukraine, Syria and Iraq. ""I still think of all the patients I took care of,"" he says, ""all the doctors that are still there. There's a little bit of guilt and shame at leaving because there's so much that needs to be done. The needs are overwhelming. And you walk away from people that are still there and still suffering."" The last trip - his third into Gaza since the war began - saw him join the first team of international medics to be embedded in a hospital in northern Gaza where malnutrition is at its most acute. The mission was organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which has warned of looming famine. Some 30% of children below the age of two are reported to be acutely malnourished, and 70% of the population in northern Gaza is facing what the UN calls ""catastrophic hunger."" Last month the UN Human Rights chief, Volker Turk, accused Israel of a potential war crime because of the food crisis in Gaza . ""The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war,"" he said. Israel denies this and has blamed the UN and aid agencies for any slow or inadequate delivery of aid. The Israeli government said UN calculations on hunger were based on ""multiple factual and methodological flaws, some of them serious."" The government has said that it had tracked media reports that food markets in Gaza, including the north, had plentiful supplies. ""We outright reject any allegations according to which Israel is purposefully starving the civilian population in Gaza,"" said a statement from COGAT - Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. Sam Attar remembers the 32-year-old woman admitted suffering from severe malnutrition, with her son, and her mother and father in the room with her. She underwent CPR - attempts to resuscitate the heart - but could not be saved. ""I had to call it,"" Sam says. The young mother lay on a bench, her left arm dangling towards the floor, eyes gazing upward in the moment of death. Across the room a nurse comforted her crying mother. There was the little girl, Jenna Ayyad, aged seven, ""just skeleton and bone"" whose mother hoped to get to the south where better medical facilities were available. Jenna was traumatised by the war and looked to be extremely malnourished. She suffers from cystic fibrosis, which makes digestion more difficult. Her condition has been exacerbated by the conditions of the war and she is also suffering from trauma. In footage taken by a BBC cameraman Jenna seems lost and now only speaks to her mother. ""What can I do? She can't be treated,"" said Nisma Ayyad. ""Her mental state is very difficult. She doesn't talk at all whenever anyone talks to her. Her situation is bad, and as a mom, I can't do anything."" Dr Attar said that as his team packed up to return to southern Gaza, Jenna's mother approached him. ""Jenna's mom came to me and was saying, 'I thought we were coming with you… what's happening? Why are you going and we're staying?"" Sam had to explain that the convoy south was only approved for the delivery of fuel and food and not for carrying patients. But before leaving Sam and his colleagues filled in the necessary papers to have Jenna transferred. It would take days but they would make sure the paperwork reached the right offices.  When Sam went to speak with Jenna's mother, other mums noticed. ""The problem is it's open, shared rooms, [with] maybe 10 patients in one room. So when all the other moms saw me talking to her, they all swarmed me."" Jenna was transferred and is now being treated at the International Medical Corps hospital near Rafah. According to UN estimates last month the majority of those killed in the war have been women and children: 13,000 children, 9,000 women. The war is now in its seventh month. Negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of hostages are stalled. Every day and night the wounded and the malnourished arrive at the few functioning hospitals that are left. The WHO says that only 10 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still functioning. Traveling in Gaza can be very dangerous for aid workers. Witness the deaths of seven aid workers, including three Britons, when the Israeli military attacked their convoy with missile strikes on 1 April. Sam describes queuing for hours at Israeli checkpoints. ""We often wait one to four hours depending on how long it takes for the Israelis to approve the passage because they are conducting military operations."" The US doctor wants to see a concerted push to get more aid into the north. ""The north just needs more access, it needs more food, more fuel, more water, the roads need to be opened… And there are so many patients that need to be evacuated from the north to the south and the problem is the south is also busy. I mean, the hospitals here are exploding."" He will go back. Soon he hopes. There are bonds of friendship which call out to him. The paramedic Nabil who Sam saw every day, bringing in the wounded for treatment, until he himself became a victim who had to be pulled from the rubble by his colleagues. He is alive but will not be able to leave Gaza. The doctor whose daughter was killed but who found the generosity to comfort a mother whose toddler son was suffering from a brain injury caused by bomb shrapnel. And there are the patients and their families who see in the doctors, nurses and paramedics not just the possibility of practical help but the steady light of human decency in a place of terror and degradation. These are Sam Attar's people. All of them.

274,Campus protests: Hundreds arrested at universities across US as Gaza demonstrations continue,"Hundreds more people were arrested at college campuses across the US on Saturday as student protests against the war in Gaza continue. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein was among those detained by police. Protestors are demanding institutions boycott companies and individuals with ties to Israel. But some Jewish students have complained about alleged antisemitism from some demonstrators. A spokesperson for Ms Stein said she was one of around 80 people to have been arrested at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. The Green Party presidential candidate was not currently believed to be facing charges, the spokesperson added. California State Polytechnic became the latest to announce it would move to remote teaching. The protests have seen in-person teaching cancelled and graduation ceremonies postponed. Tents first appeared on the college green at Columbia on 17 April. The protests then spread across the country after police in riot gear were sent to clear the tents, arresting more than 100 students. Shortly after, students erected another protest camp at Yale University in Connecticut. At Northeastern University in Boston, over 100 protesters were arrested for trespassing on Saturday by the Massachusetts State Police after refusing to clear their tents from college grounds, according to a police statement. The camp was cleared by police. Northeastern University wrote on X that ""demonstrations had been infiltrated by professional organisers"" with no connection to the university. Antisemitic slurs had been heard, it added, saying: ""We cannot tolerate this kind of hate on campus."" Protest leaders strongly rejected the allegations. At the University of South California, pro-Palestinian demonstrators returned to campus days after police were called to clear a protest at the university's Alumni Park. The protest was reportedly mostly peaceful but the university administration reported ""vandalism"" to campus property after Saturday's protest. The university said the campus had been vandalised ""by individuals who are part of the group that has continued to illegally camp on our campus"", adding that a statue and fountain had been damaged. The campus would be temporarily closed to non-residents, the university said. Twenty-three people were arrested at Indiana University on Saturday. Other campuses, including Columbia and Emory University in Georgia, were reportedly quieter Saturday. The protests were sparked by anger at Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched the offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, mostly civilians, were killed and 253 others were taken to Gaza as hostages, when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza on 7 October last year.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68915021,politics
275,Israel-Gaza briefings: Have Iran-Israel missile strikes changed the Middle East?,"News in the Middle East moves fast. One moment it is all about unprecedented missile and drone attacks between Iran and Israel. The next the headlines return to the fighting and suffering in Gaza. But policymakers, analysts and military leaders are still absorbing the extraordinary exchange of fire just days ago between two old adversaries, one that arguably came a small technological failure away from triggering a devastating international conflict. It is worth considering how close they came to the edge and how deep the abyss that lay before them. This was the first time Iran and Israel had attacked each other directly. Some analysts say the Iranian attack was the largest combined missile and drone assault ever - bigger than anything Russia has levelled against Ukraine. It was certainly the first external bombardment of Israel since Saddam Hussein's Scud missiles in 1991. Most of the 300-plus Iranian drones and missiles were shot down or failed en route. But I watched from our office in Jerusalem as the night sky was lit up by Israeli air defences trying to bring down the ballistic missiles flying overhead. All it would have taken is for one GPS guidance system to fail for a missile to land in an urban area at huge civilian cost. ""I don't think people realise how close we were that weekend,"" one senior Western security official told me. ""It could have been a very different story."" Yet some in the West think positives can be drawn from the attack on 13 April and Israel's limited retaliation last week. They argue it was a huge intelligence success to predict the Iranian strike, that the defence of Israel was an outstanding example of allied military cooperation, and that both Iran and Israel learned how to climb down the escalatory ladder. Let's take the intelligence operation first. I am told the US learned about Iran's plans on the Wednesday morning before the attack on Saturday evening. And crucially, they discovered the scale of Iran's ambition. ""We got wind that Iran's response would be at the top end of expectations,"" said one high-level Western source. ""And that was a bit of a shock. But it helped galvanise the international response."" Crucially, it helped the US persuade some countries in the Gulf to join in Israel's defence, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Their fear - once they were aware of the scale of Iran's plans - was the risk of an escalatory regional war if Israel had no choice but to retaliate hard. So a mixture of good intelligence gathering and private Iranian signalling (which the US denies took place) gave Israel and its allies time to prepare. The roles played by Jordan and Saudi Arabia are still not fully clear. Jordan has admitted shooting down Iranian drones in self-defence to protect its sovereignty. It is understood Jordan also allowed Israeli warplanes some access to its airspace. The Saudis are thought to have provided information to the US and kept an eye on any threat from Iranian-backed armed groups in Yemen. The key point is it worked. The US, British, French, Jordanian and Saudi militaries showed they could operate together on collective air defence. ""It was an extraordinarily successful tactical operation,"" said the security source. ""The intelligence cued it up, we had sight of the whole area and we worked together. No other group of nations can do that in the world."" Some have also argued this could be the start of a new regional alliance against Iran. To others, though, that is a typical security and military perspective, one that celebrates technological success while missing the bigger political picture. The more pessimistic analysts argue that if Iran wanted to inflict significant damage on Israel, it could have refrained from giving advance warning, broadened its targets, launched a second wave of attacks - or even ordered Hezbollah to mount a large attack from Lebanon. Emile Hokayem from the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank said the operation revealed how much Israel had to rely on allies for its defence. He also wondered whether Israel would have enough air defence missiles needed for a higher intensity conflict. ""As we've seen in the war between Ukraine and Russia, it matters how much of the good stuff you have in stock,"" he said. Mr Hokayem also dismissed the idea this crisis marked the beginning of a new regional military alliance. ""We're not at the cusp of a new era,"" he said. ""Arab states have cooperated because primarily they want to avoid a regional confrontation. And they want to demonstrate they're good partners to their western allies. It's also simply a matter of national sovereignty. They don't want stuff flying and exploding in their skies."" The second claim by optimists is that Iran and Israel have learned from this experience. They say both countries - for once - communicated their intentions accurately; they realised they could de-escalate without losing face; and they both had a scare that will re-establish mutual deterrence. Iran may have attacked Israel but it warned allies of its intent and signalled early it was a one-off. Israel showed it could retaliate modestly, targeting air defences in central Iran and using a small attack to signal a bigger capability, namely that it could hit Iran where and when it wanted. I am told Iran may even have been tipped off about Israel's retaliation. Certainly Iran signalled from a very early stage it did not intend to respond to Israel's counter-attack. Both sides certainly will have learned military lessons. ""The attack probably helped Iran identify the relative strengths and the weaknesses of the Israeli air defence system,"" said the Institute for the Study of War. Israel and the US will also have a greater understanding of Iran's tactical strategies. The counter-argument is that both Iran and Israel broke a taboo, that direct attack is now an easier option. In an essay for Foreign Affairs, Afshon Ostovar from the Foreign Policy Research Institute says the scale of Iran's attack shows it is no longer convinced by a policy of restraint. ""The notion that Iran intentionally launched a weak attack does not stand up to scrutiny,"" he writes. ""Iran hoped to land an impressive blow against Israel."" Mr Hokayem challenges the idea Iran and Israel have learned to understand each other. He cites Israel's failure to realise the consequences of its decision to kill several elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commanders in Iran's consulate in Damascus. ""These two countries don't talk to each other. Instead, they just signal through military posturing and third parties. These things can go badly quite quickly. Wrongly reading the other side's intentions - or risk appetite - is a feature rather than a bug in the relationship."" There is also scepticism either side have re-established deterrence. Amos Harel, defence analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said: ""The two countries breached the previous rules of the game, with limited costs… the balance of deterrence between the two countries (is) unsettled."" Perhaps the key lesson learned by many in this crisis was just how close the region had come to full scale war. ""It was just a huge relief,"" one Western diplomat told me. ""It could have gone so differently.""",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68900571,politics
276,Gaza protests: Police raid on Columbia protest ignited campus movement,"At dawn on Wednesday 17 April, a small group of students pitched their tents at Columbia University, demonstrating against Israeli military action in Gaza and calling on their university to stop doing business with companies they see as supporting the war. They did so as Minouche Shafik, Columbia's president, made her way to Capitol Hill to face a Congressional grilling over antisemitism on campus and how she was tackling it. In nearly four hours of questioning that Wednesday, she defended actions she was already taking. Students, she said, were ""getting the message that violations of our policies will have consequences"". The next afternoon, the Columbia president made a decision that would ignite a wildfire of protest at colleges across the United States. The students at the protest camp were trespassing, had refused to leave and had created a ""harassing and intimidating environment"" for many of their peers, she said. She was sending in the NYPD. Soon after, officers from the largest police department in the US, wearing riot gear and wielding plastic handcuffs, arrested more than 100 students - the first time mass arrests had been made on Columbia's campus since Vietnam War protests more than five decades ago. ""It was a shock to us all,"" said Rashida Mustafa, a doctoral student at Columbia. ""I was in disbelief. But it felt like a call to action."" The outrage among students was immediate. By the next day, another protest camp was established at a different lawn just a few metres away. It was much bigger than before, having swelled from a small number of tents to a congested campsite, complete with buffet-style meals of donated food, live performances and a ""security team"" at the gate watching for infiltrators. A day later, another protest camp was set up just over 70 miles (112km) north-east of Columbia, at Yale University in Connecticut, another elite institution. By the middle of this week, demonstrations were taking place at dozens of campuses across the country, and they stretched into the weekend: US police said on Saturday they had ended another protest at Northeastern University in Boston, arresting about 100 people. The Columbia students have sparked a national movement. The students' anger over how Israel is fighting its war against Hamas has raised fraught questions for university leaders, who are already struggling with combustive campus debates around what is happening in the Middle East. How do they balance the right to protest and free speech with the need to protect other students from harm and abuse? When do they send in the police to enforce university policies, knowing heavy-handed responses will be filmed and appear instantly on millions of social media feeds? At Yale, police arrived at a protest encampment in the heart of the campus in the early hours of 22 April as many students were still asleep. Nearly 50 students were arrested after refusing to leave, with some locking arms around a flagpole. ""They came very quickly, and with no warning. Droves of police just poured into the plaza,"" Chisato Kimura, a law student, told the BBC from New Haven. ""Seeing a militarised force, invited by Yale to come onto campus, was very jarring,"" she added. ""We were peacefully protesting."" US college campuses have been a flashpoint for Gaza war protests since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages. Since then more than 34,000 people, most of them women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. But the past 10 days have seen the most intense and widespread US protests of the past six months. Simmering tensions boiled over after the first Columbia camp was cleared - clashes and arrests followed elsewhere. At the University of Texas at Austin, state troopers - some on horseback - stopped hundreds of students occupying a university lawn on Wednesday. At Emory University in Atlanta, a female professor was wrestled to the ground by a police officer, and a video of her being stopped and handcuffed went viral on Thursday. Police have also taken on protesters at Emerson College in Boston, George Washington University in Washington DC, New York University and the University of Southern California (USC). The protest encampments are calling on university administrators to ""divest"" school endowments from companies they perceive as linked to Israel's war in Gaza, cut ties with Israeli academic institutions and formally call for a ceasefire Some Jewish students and faculty have said they fear for their safety. And these concerns are part of what has prompted university officials, including Ms Shafik, to call in police. ""Students have a right to protest,"" said Page Fortna, a political science professor at Columbia. ""But they don't have a right to protest in a way that makes other students feel discriminated against or harassed."" In interviews this week, Jewish students at several campuses spoke of incidents that made them feel uncomfortable, ranging from chants and signs supporting Hamas, a proscribed terror group, to physical altercations and perceived threats. Eli Kia, a 22-year-old Jewish student at USC, said the protests had left him with a constant sense of unease and fear. He has begun hiding a Star of David he wears on a chain. ""It's challenging to feel safe coming to school every day,"" he told the BBC. ""There's that second thought when you walk on campus of 'what am I going to walk into?' and 'what am I facing?', and 'who's potentially coming after me?'"" Northeastern University authorities said some of the protesters had used antisemitic slogans, which is why they decided to take action on Saturday. The university said the demonstration started as a student protests but that outsiders had also joined it. Many protesters have sought to distance themselves from antisemitic incidents and in some cases they have blamed outside agitators. They say that many Jewish students have joined the protests and that the focus should be on the civilian death toll in Gaza. As negotiations between institutions and students grind on, many demonstrators - and their outside supporters - are convinced that what they see as heavy-handed police tactics will help keep the movement going. ""This is a movement that started with only 70 students,"" Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat fiercely critical of the Biden administration's Gaza policy, told the BBC while visiting the Columbia encampment this week. ""And because Columbia University decided to crack down on them and violate their first amendment, this has now spread nationally and internationally."" Her daughter was one of the Columbia protesters arrested. Omar Zegar, a protester at USC, said he believed Columbia was only the start of a wider movement. ""I think a lot of universities nationwide will begin doing these encampments,"" he said. ""The police escalated the situation."" For some observers, the protests hark back to the 1960s, and demonstrations against US involvement in the Vietnam War. Marianne Hirsch, a Columbia professor who participated in the 1960s protests, told reporters this week that - like with the Vietnam War - the situation in Gaza should make it ""impossible to continue business as usual"". The wave of protests also adds to a politically stressful time for President Joe Biden, who has been criticised by some for his country's backing of Israel, as he campaigns for re-election. Some Democrats fear thousands of protesters will swarm this summer's national convention in Chicago, where the party will formally make him its presidential nominee. The 1968 convention, also in Chicago, was overshadowed by Vietnam War demonstrations. Ahmad Hasan, a USC graduate who attended rallies this week, said he believed that the student protests would have a wider impact on US attitudes. ""It has always rested on students to tell people that this is not right,"" he said, ""that we won't stand for this.""",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68906215,politics
277,'I thought just kill me quickly': Gaza hostage's 54 days in captivity,"It was the third time they caught her. Crouching in a shallow dip in the field, Moran Stella Yanai knew this time was different. ""I heard 'Coo-coo!' and we raised our heads up - the terrorists were standing [there], smiling,"" she said. ""Everyone started to run, I jumped and broke my leg, and they caught me."" Warning: This article contains details some readers may find disturbing. Moran had been desperately trying to hide in the sparse cover of a potato field, as Hamas gunmen raided the site of the Nova music festival, a few miles from the Gaza border. Hours earlier on 7 October, the gunmen had burst through Gaza's perimeter fence, attacking Israeli communities. Moran had already been caught twice by groups of Hamas followers, she said, but had talked her way out by insisting she was Arab, and not Jewish. The third time, her captors were different. ""They didn't talk, they just grabbed me,"" she remembered. ""They started to throw me from one to the other, and put me in the car. Two terrorists in the front, four in the backseat, three more in the [boot], and only me on top of everybody."" As they crossed the Gaza border, Moran glimpsed the crowd on the other side of the fence, before quickly closing her eyes. ""It was like a bull being entered into a huge arena,"" she told the BBC. ""Everybody's happy - the children, the women, the men. It was tons of people."" She felt the car stop, and the car door open. ""I felt someone trying to pull my leg... All you can think of at that point is: please let it end fast. One hit to the head, and I will not feel anything. If it's happening, make it fast."" But the car door closed again, and the vehicle began to move off, carrying Moran with it. She says she later learned that the group holding her had sold her to Hamas. It was the beginning of 54 days in captivity for Moran. During that time, she was transferred between seven different locations, quickly learning strategies to survive. ""You really need to protect your story,"" she explained. ""What happens in the first house stays there, and doesn't come with you to the second house [or] the third house."" Each time, she said, it was important to pretend that everything in the previous location had been fine, and that her kidnappers had been her friends. To hint at anything sexual, she believes, would have led to the group killing both captor and captive. At one point, she was held with another woman, who was 18 years old and kidnapped while she was barefoot and still in her pyjamas. Moran, who understands a little Arabic, remembers overhearing their captors discuss who would take the women as their wives. She said they even found the younger woman's mother among the other hostages and brought her in, asking for permission to marry her daughter. ""When you move from house to house, you need to be 'examined' to see that you're not hiding something on you,"" Moran said, sarcasm tilting across her face. ""It's a 'really necessary test', as they explain it to you."" She looks away, the silence growing between us. ""I always try to explain to people that 'rape' is a really big word,"" she said. ""It's not only the act. Even when a guy stands in front of your door, and you're sitting down, and he's staring at you for 10 minutes straight, five to six times a day, every day, for 54 days. Trust me; that's a rape."" Asked whether she was the victim of sexual assault while held captive, Moran says she was not, but that she has heard from other women hostages that they were raped while in Gaza. She described being beaten up by her captors, and the mental terror of being powerless in a situation that could change in a second. One day, she said, they sat down to play cards with their captors. ""I was so hungry, I was trying to make them laugh so they would bring us something to eat,"" she remembered. ""[One of the captors] was mocking me. I got angry and said something as a joke. He runs to the other room, comes back, and points a gun to my head, yelling at me, screaming that he will kill me, will blow my head off."" After 54 days in captivity, Moran Yanai was released in a ceasefire deal last November, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel jails. Her Hamas captors filmed the handover, where she and other hostages were seen smiling and thanking their kidnappers before boarding the Red Cross bus out of Gaza. Many people remarked at the time that they seemed well and even happy. ""They made us smile, and say thank you,"" Moran said. ""Nobody heard the whispers that I'm saying to the boy next to me: hold on, five more minutes, don't start to cry now, stay smiling."" It's the first time in over an hour recounting her story that Moran's composure fractures. Her tears sudden, fast and silent. The moment she crossed the border to Egypt, she says, was the moment she had waited all those weeks in captivity to cry. ""We couldn't [cry] when they were dragging us into Gaza, we couldn't do it in the houses, and that's the first thing I promised myself - that the minute I step into my country, I'll scream as loud as I can, because nobody will take my voice anymore."" Israeli officials believe about 30 of the 133 hostages remaining in Gaza are dead. Hopes of another ceasefire deal to secure their release have dimmed. Stories of the conditions - and sexual assaults - in captivity have gradually emerged from some of those already released. Moran says she lost 12% of her bodyweight, and her hair, during 54 days in Gaza, and that her body was covered with scars. It is hard for her to imagine what it's like for the hostages still held there, five months on. ""If this isn't solved, then no-one is free,"" she said. ""I can't go back to a daily routine; I can't go back to anything.""",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68891217,politics
278,UK forces may be deployed on the ground in Gaza to help deliver aid,"British troops could be deployed on the ground in Gaza to help deliver aid via a new sea route, the BBC has learned. The US has said no American forces would go ashore and an unnamed ""third party"" would drive trucks along a floating causeway onto the beach. The UK is understood to be considering tasking British troops with this when the aid corridor opens next month. Whitehall sources said no decision had been made and the issue had not yet crossed the prime minister's desk. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Israeli army declined to comment. Britain has been closely involved in planning the sea-borne aid operation and Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK continued to take ""a leading role in the delivery of support in coordination with the US and other international allies"". The possible role for British forces - known as ""wet boots"" by military planners - would see them drive trucks off landing craft onto the temporary causeway and deliver aid to a secure distribution area ashore. Although a huge effort would be made to protect allied forces both off and onshore, British troops would potentially face a higher risk of attack from Hamas and other armed groups. On Wednesday, a United Nations team had to take cover when mortars landed near the planned distribution zone. US defence officials confirmed an American army ship had begun work in the eastern Mediterranean to build a large floating pier. Aid would be delivered there from Cyprus on large ships before being transferred into trucks and smaller landing craft. They said the floating causeway would be ""several hundred metres long"" and anchored firmly into the sand. They said they hoped the new maritime corridor - which they call the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) operation - would ultimately deliver up to 150 trucks per day. The aim is to add to - but not replace - aid deliveries by land that are still insufficient to meet the need. On average about 220 aid trucks per day are currently getting into Gaza by road. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it will provide ""security and logistics support for the JLOTS initiative… to enhance the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip"". Israel's military will be responsible for anchoring the floating causeway to the beach and has been practising how to do this with American forces further north on the Israeli coast. In a briefing with journalists, a senior US military official said because there would be no American boots on the ground, hundreds of US soldiers and sailors would live and sleep at sea on a UK naval vessel, RFA Cardigan Bay. He also made clear US forces would not take the aid ashore and instead that role would be carried out by a ""significant partner"". He confirmed this would be another nation, not a private military company. ""We have a third party who will be driving the trucks down the pier,"" the US military official said. ""Just a point of emphasis, there will be no US military boots on the ground. So, a third party is driving those trucks."" Despite questioning from journalists, he refused to name the third party. One UK source said nothing had been decided but there was a debate going on about ""do we put wet boots on the beach, do we drive trucks onto the pier?"". The MoD declined to comment about the suggestion UK forces might drive trucks ashore, but Mr Shapps said the crew of RFA Cardigan Bay were central to the UK's contribution, adding: ""It is critical we establish more routes for vital humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza."" He said specialist British military planning teams had been embedded within the US operational HQ in Tampa, Florida - as well as in Cyprus - for several weeks to help develop the safest and most effective maritime route. The UK Hydrographic Office has also shared analysis of the Gazan shore with US planners to develop the pier. More than six months into Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip, over half of its population of 2.2 million is crammed into the southern city of Rafah. The UN has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe and Israel has faced international criticism for limiting the amount of aid reaching civilians by land. Ziad Issa, the head of humanitarian policy at ActionAid, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Any way to deliver aid to Gaza is welcome and will help a bit, but the problem with this way of delivering aid is it's going to take time and there are lots of logistical uncertainties about it."" He said it would be more efficient to allow delivery trucks into Gaza via land crossings. Trucks ""loaded with tonnes of medical supplies, with food"" are currently waiting to enter Gaza but are not being allowed in by Israeli forces, Mr Issa said - and aid workers are calling for Israel to permanently open a land crossing at Erez. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began on 7 October. The IDF launched the offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 253 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68909511,politics
279,Pelosi urges Gaza campus protesters to target Hamas as well as Israel,"Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, has urged protesters on college campuses to protest against Hamas' behaviour as well as Israel's conduct of the Gaza war. Hundreds of people have been arrested on dozens of campuses across the US, where protests and encampments have sprung up in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Ms Pelosi, who is a close ally of US President Joe Biden, told the BBC there was ""complete justification"" for speaking out about the growing humanitarian crisis there and the impact on civilians of Israel's bombardment was almost ""unforgiveable"". She has also criticised the actions of the Israeli government while arguing it has a right to self-defence, and is no fan of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. However, she said she wanted the demonstrators to reflect on their tactics and also condemn Hamas's actions on 7 October. ""We would like to see some of that enthusiasm recognise Hamas as a terrorist organisation that did a barbaric thing in Israel,"" she said. Ms Pelosi had her speech at the Oxford Union in the UK interrupted by protesters on Thursday night. Demonstrators also dumped manure outside her own home in California. ""I've said to those [protesters]...do you care about what Hamas has done, do you care about what happened in Israel, would you not, if that happened here would we not have a response?"" The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages. Since then, at least 34,356 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. The UN has warned of an impending humanitarian catastrophe and Israel has faced accusations of limiting the amount of aid reaching civilians by land. Activists in the US have been calling for universities to ""divest from genocide"" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza. Israel is currently facing a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians, an accusation Israel has rejected as ""baseless"". She said such protests on college campuses were a ""way of life"" in the US and that there was ""complete justification"" for objecting to what has been happening. ""What's happening in Gaza challenges the consciousness of the world,"" she said. Some of the protesters on US campuses have been accused of antisemitism. A number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations. Ms Pelosi said protesters needed to think about their tactics, asking: ""What is their message, what is their purpose?"" She rejected the suggestion from the current leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, that the National Guard should be sent in to deal with the protests. Universities have brought in police to force students to leave but some are negotiating with the demonstrators and say these talks are showing progress. The full interview with Nancy Pelosi will be broadcast on the Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show, at 09:00 BST on BBC One.",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68909910,politics
280,Columbia campus protester apologises for 'kill Zionists' comments,"A leader of students protesting the war in Gaza at Columbia University has apologised after video emerged of him saying ""Zionists don't deserve to live"". Khymani James, 20, said he was ""unusually upset"" and ""misspoke in the heat of the moment"". On Friday, Columbia announced that he had been banned from campus. Protests which began at Columbia in New York City have since spread to campuses across the US. Mr James, who has acted as a spokesman for the protesters, posted the comments to Instagram in January. He also said: ""Be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists."" The comments were made both before and after Columbia administrators called him in for a disciplinary hearing. ""I don't fight to injure or for there to be a winner or a loser, I fight to kill,"" he said in a post. In recent days, those comments were circulated by pro-Israel activists. On Friday Mr James apologised, writing in a statement on X: ""I affirm the sanctity of all life and the movement for liberation."" ""All people deserve to be safe from physical harm."" ""Calls of violence and statements targeted at individuals based on their religious, ethnic, or national identity are unacceptable and violate university policy,"" the university said in a statement. A spokesman for the White House issued a statement condemning his remarks about Zionists. ""These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wakeup call,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""It is hideous to advocate for the murder of Jews."" Some of the campus protests on US campuses have been accused of antisemitism, and President Biden earlier this week condemned the ""antisemitic protests"". A number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations. On Friday, the Columbia University Senate, made up of faculty and students, voted to admonish the university administration for its handling of the protests. Calling city police in to clear the encampment ran ""contrary to the norms and traditions"" of the university, the senate said. Columbia President Nemat ""Minouche"" Shafik is facing pressure to step down over the response to the protests. The latest wave of campus protests began after Columbia officials called in police to clear a protest encampment on 18 April and more than 100 people were arrested. Activists have been calling for universities to ""divest from genocide"" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza. Israel is currently facing a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians, an accusation Israel has rejected as ""baseless"". Among the recent developments: The war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages. More than 34,180 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. Are you a student in the US?

281,Council apologises to arms manufacturer,"Somerset Council has been forced to apologise to an Israeli-linked arms firm, after it was accused of providing weapons to the country's military. Elbit Systems UK is a tenant at the council's Aztec West 600 building near Bristol, which it inherited when it became a unitary authority for the county. Protesters have targeted Somerset Council's building in Taunton a number of times over its links to Elbit Systems UK. The firm said it provided equipment to the British army and and that any direct links with Israel were ""grossly misleading"". The council is in the process of exploring legal routes to remove Elbit Systems UK from its premises. Writing on social media, the council said: ""On 23 April 2024, Somerset Council voted on a motion in respect of a commercial investment property it owns at 600 Aztec West. ""That motion included a statement that 'the tenant Elbit UK [is] a major UK based provider of weapons to the Israeli Defence Forces, used in the current Gaza catastrophe'. ""Elbit Systems UK Limited have contacted us to say this is factually incorrect and they do not supply weapons or military equipment to the Israeli Defence Forces or the Israeli Ministry of Defence. ""The Council would like to apologise and withdraw the statement that Elbit Systems UK Limited supplies military equipment to the Israeli Defence Forces or the Israeli Ministry of Defence."" Following the vote this week, Elbit Systems UK issued a statement saying it provided equipment to the British army and that ""nothing from the Aztec site goes to the IDF"", branding any direct links with Israel as ""grossly misleading"". A spokesman said: ""We continue to invest and expand our range of services in the United Kingdom, providing critical support and advanced technology to the British armed forces from Aztec West 600 and other sites across the country."" Somerset Council has faced repeated pressure from protesters over its links with Elbit Systems UK. Its council building in Taunton has been covered in paint several times in the last few weeks by Palestine Action, while meetings between councillors have been interrupted. The group has demanded the council evict Elbit Systems UK, and has claimed to have presented the council with a legal pathway to do so.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2len5jlzqpo,politics
282,Major Gaza protests at US universities,"Protests calling for universities to boycott companies and individuals with ties to Israel amid the ongoing war there have swept college campuses across the US. Tensions have been escalating at universities in the wake of the 7 October attack by Hamas that left around 1,200 people dead in Israel, and led to Israel's assault on Gaza that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians. Major encampments and protests were seen first at Columbia University in New York, but have since erupted elsewhere across the country. Students have been arrested at campuses in Los Angeles, California and in Atlanta, Georgia. In Austin, Texas, the governor ordered state troopers to arrest protesters. With protests now ongoing at over two dozen campuses, here are where some of the largest are taking place: Columbia was the first university to see a major pro-Palestinian encampment form on campus, and among the first to be accused of antisemitism. More than 100 protesters were arrested last week after the Ivy League university's president asked police to clear the protest site. Her request followed her testimony to Congress about the university's response to alleged antisemitism on campus. But the mass arrests appear to have galvanised the movement, according to demonstrators who remained onsite one week later. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose daughter was arrested at Columbia, told BBC News the movement started with just a few students but quickly spread due to the mass arrests. ""This is a movement that started with only 70 students,"" she told BBC News at Columbia on Thursday. ""And because Columbia University decided to crack down on them and violate their First Amendment, this has now spread nationally and internationally."" In Atlanta, several dozen protesters ""not affiliated"" with Emory University set up tents on campus early Thursday morning, the school said in a statement. Administrators said the group of trespassers was later joined by members of the university community. But when the protesters refused to disperse, the Emory Police Department ""took a couple dozen people into custody"". The statement did not clarify how many arrests were made and which charges the suspects could face. The decision by the University of Southern California to cancel the valedictorian's speech at commencement - followed by its cancellation of the main 10 May commencement - led to outrage on campus. The ceremony was expected to draw some 65,000 people to campus. The valedictorian, who was chosen due to high grades and involvement in campus life, had posted a link to a website that was critical of Israel, which led to recent accusations of antisemitism. The university said the cancellation was due to unspecified threats to campus security and did not condemn the student's post. But the decision angered both pro- and anti-Israel demonstrators. Pro-Palestinian protesters called for the student, who is Muslim, to deliver her speech. Pro-Israel students called for the school to condemn her posts. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Police Department was called in and arrested 93 people. Hundreds of students and faculty members held a march from Georgetown University to nearby George Washington University, where an encampment was set up on Thursday. At least 20 tents have been erected on the university's normally quiet campus in northwest DC. At the nearby American University, a group of students protested outside the office of the school's president on Wednesday. No arrests have been made. Police said 57 arrests were made on Wednesday night at the University of Texas (UT) in Austin. Troopers with the Texas Department of Public Safety wearing riot gear were seen using their bikes to push protesters back. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott, who called in the troopers, posted on X that the protests are antisemitic and called for student protesters to be expelled. Democrats in the state accused him of using the mass arrests as a ""campaign ad"". The state National Guard issued a statement denying that it had been mobilised to make arrests on campus. ""While the Texas National Guard was aware and prepared to respond to the protests at UT yesterday, no Soldiers were dispatched to the campus during the event,"" the Texas Military Department said in a statement. It added that the force is prepared to ""respond if requested"". On Monday, police arrested 120 people who erected an impromptu encampment the downtown Manhattan campus. All but four of those arrested were charged with trespassing. On Wednesday, encampments formed in Harvard Yard after the university administration suspended the student group the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee. Harvard's president has refused to rule out asking the police to respond. No arrests have been made. Protests have been seen at a least two dozen universities, and even in some high schools around the US. In Boston, 108 people were arrested at Emerson University early Thursday morning, leading the university to cancel classes. Four police officers were injured during the protest. In Connecticut, protests are ongoing at Yale University , even after 48 people were arrested on Wednesday. All but four of those arrested were Yale students. On Tuesday, high schoolers in the Seattle area walked out of classes in protest against the war. School officials in New Jersey have sternly warned high school students there against taking part in a walk out planned for Friday. Correction: This story was updated to reflect that a tent encampment was set up at George Washington University and not Georgetown University.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68901927,politics
283,Gaza pier: US begins building floating base to boost aid,"The US military has started building a large floating pier off Gaza's coast to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, the defence department has said. Ships will deliver aid from Cyprus to the pier where it will be loaded onto trucks to transfer across Gaza. The pier will be attached to the shore by a temporary causeway, which the trucks will use. US officials say the pier will be operational by early May but there will be no US boots on the ground in Gaza. The plan was first announced by President Joe Biden in March as part of efforts to tackle hunger in Gaza compounded by problems with aid deliveries, as Israel continues its military campaign against Hamas. The UN has warned that famine in the Gaza Strip is ""almost inevitable"" and children are starving to death. More than 1,000 US troops are expected to be involved in building the floating harbour, but the Pentagon made clear from the start that the workers would not set foot on land. The causeway will be assembled at sea, allowing US forces to avoid stepping onto the ground. And a British naval vessel in the eastern Mediterranean will be a floating dormitory for the American soldiers and sailors. They will live and sleep aboard RFA [Royal Fleet Auxiliary] Cardigan Bay. A Pentagon spokesperson, Major General Pat Ryder, told a news conference on Thursday: ""US military vessels... have begun to construct the initial stages of the temporary pier and causeway at sea."" He said that the causeway would connect to the temporary pier, ""which is out at sea, and the causeway which eventually will join land and be anchored, so to speak."" The US says that once the system is operational, up to 150 trucks of aid could be delivered a day with  two million meals, enough to feed almost all of the territory's 2.3 million population. Israel has faced international criticism with accusations it is limiting the amount of aid that reaches by land Gaza's civilians in dire need of food. Israel has blamed aid agencies for the hold-ups. Israel said it would provide security and logistical support during the construction work and the transfer of aid from the pier to Gaza's population. But aid agencies have voiced concerns over how the Israeli military will handle security, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement about it. A senior American official told Reuters news agency that humanitarian aid to be delivered off the pier would need to pass through Israeli checkpoints on land. That was despite the aid having already been inspected and screened by Israel in Cyprus prior to being shipped to Gaza. Israel has reiterated that it would prevent any aid getting to Hamas fighters. But the extra checkpoints once the aid is offloaded onto trucks have raised questions about possible delays. The UN agencies have long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and its distribution. The World Food Programme has agreed to lead the delivery operation, but the UN agency said Israel must ensure that aid workers are not harmed. Many aid groups are apprehensive about working in Gaza after seven World Central Kitchen workers were killed in an Israeli air strike on 1 April while driving in clearly marked vehicles with prior permission from the IDF to travel.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68904209,politics
284,California college cancels graduation ceremony as protests over Israel's war in Gaza continue,"A leading California university has cancelled its graduation ceremony as protests over Gaza continue to spread on college campuses across the US. The University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles cited ""new safety measures"" in disbanding the event. Hundreds of people have been arrested on dozens of campuses where protests and encampments have sprung up in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Universities have brought in police to force students to leave. But some are also negotiating. At Columbia University in New York City, where the protests began last week, a Thursday night deadline for an end to the encampment was dropped. Talks were showing progress and would continue, the university said. At Atlanta's Emory University, 28 demonstrators were arrested on Thursday after refusing to leave. Emory's police force said protesters had ""pushed past"" officers protecting the area set up for commencement on Thursday morning. The force acknowledged that chemical irritants had been released as part of crowd control measures, though they said it was in response to objects being thrown at officers. Atlanta Police also confirmed using chemical irritants but denied reports they had fired rubber bullets at protesters. One protester shown on video being detained by police identified herself as Noelle McAfee, chair of Emory's philosophy department. Ms McAfee said she was observing what she described as a peaceful protest when police began to move in and the protesters started to march. ""It went from a peaceful protest to mayhem in the matter of a minute,"" she said. She said she had frozen and been quickly detained. The latest wave of campus protests began after officials at Columbia University called in police to clear a new protest encampment and more than 100 people were arrested. Activists have been calling for universities to ""divest from genocide"" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza. Israel is currently facing a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians, an accusation Israel has rejected as ""baseless"". Chisato Mimura, a law student and protest leader at Yale University in Connecticut, told the BBC that activists were upset at President Joe Biden as well as their school officials for ""quite literally funding and equipping the weapons used in genocide"". ""What they're doing is completely putting their full weight behind it,"" she said. ""We are well aware of the prominent role they are playing."" Some of the protests on US campuses have been accused of antisemitism. A number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations. Earlier on Thursday, Minnesota Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar visited the campus. Her daughter, Isra Hirsi, was one of the protesters cleared from the university by police last week. ""This is a movement that started with only 70 students,"" Ms Omar told the BBC. ""And because Columbia University decided to crack down on them and violate their First Amendment [rights], this has now spread nationally and internationally.""

285,Baby saved from dead mother's womb in Gaza dies,"A baby rescued from her dying mother's womb after an Israeli air strike in southern Gaza has died, the BBC has learned. Baby Sabreen al-Sakani was delivered by Caesarean section in a Rafah hospital shortly after midnight on Sunday. Amid chaotic scenes doctors resuscitated the baby, using a hand pump to push air into her lungs. However she died on Thursday and has been buried next to her mother after whom she was named. Baby Sabreen was among 16 children killed in two air strikes in Rafah last weekend. All were killed in a bombardment targeting the housing complex where they lived. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure. Sabreen's mother, also called Sabreen, was seven-and-a-half months pregnant when the Israeli air strike on the al-Sakani family home took place just before midnight on Saturday as she, her husband Shukri and their three-year-old daughter Malak were asleep. She suffered extensive injuries and her husband and Malak were killed, but the baby was still alive in her mother's womb when rescue workers reached the site. They rushed Sabreen to hospital, where doctors performed an emergency Caesarean section to deliver the child. It appeared that baby Sabreen had stabilised and she was subsequently placed in an incubator. At the time doctors described her condition as critical. She weighed just 1.4kg (3.1 lbs) when she was born and was in severe respiratory distress, which doctors said was because she had been born prematurely. ""This child should have been in the mother's womb at this time, but she was deprived of this right,"" Dr Mohammed Salama, head of the emergency neo-natal unit at Emirati Hospital in Rafah, said after she was born. Baby Sabreen's maternal grandmother, Mirvat al-Sakani, told the BBC the family had planned to adopt the child. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that of the more than 34,000 people killed in Gaza since the war began on 7 October, at least two-thirds are women and children. Israel launched its offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 253 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. There are now an estimated 1.4 million people crowded into Rafah having been told by the IDF to move south to safety earlier in the war. However Israel says it is planning a ground offensive into Rafah, with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu insisting it is necessary to defeat Hamas and search for hostages. Satellite images show two new tent encampments in southern Gaza with Israeli media reports saying preparations to evacuate civilians from Rafah were under way. The US has appealed to Israel to adopt a targeted approach rather than launch a full-scale invasion of Rafah, which might precipitate an even greater humanitarian crisis.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68903591,politics
286,"Headband was worn in support of Hamas, judge finds","A man has been found guilty of wearing a headband in support of Hamas at a pro-Palestine rally in central London. Khaled Hajsaad, 24, wore the clothing at a pro-Palestine rally in Trafalgar Square on 25 November 2023. The green headband had the ""Shahada"" written on it in white - the basic statement of the Islamic faith, the court was told. Hajsaad told police the headband was ""an item of Saudi Arabia"" and the Shahada was a ""statement of my faith"". He was found guilty, at the City of London Magistrates' Court, of wearing the item ""in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion"" he was supporting Hamas - an illegal act in the UK where it is designated a terrorist group. District Judge Nina Tempia told the court: ""Hamas is the most notable Palestinian group associated with the colour green… He was wearing the headband at the pro-Palestinian march, where there would be no reasons for someone to wear the headband of a Saudi flag. ""It clearly did not have the Saudi sword on it. ""I find the defendant guilty of the offence."" Judge Tempia added: ""I find the harm serious and when it happened, so soon after 7 October, it would have meant significant distress.""

Virginia Moffatt, 58, and Chris Cole, 60, from Dorset, were campaigning on 29 December 2023 for a ceasefire and an end to UK arms sales to Israel. The Christian protesters were found guilty at City of London Magistrates' Court of criminal damage. Cole was fined £692 because of prior offences while Moffatt was not fined. The pair's bloody handprints and paint splashes caused ""significant damage"", Judge Patricia Evans told the court. She said: ""It took a professional cleaning company one and a half hours to clean. And the cost was £138."" According to an earlier statement released by campaign group FigTree, the pair said the government had ""blood on its hands"" after refusing to demand Israel end its bombing of Gaza. On 13 December, the UK and Germany abstained over a United Nations resolution, backed by 153 countries, demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. FigTree said: ""By refusing to back a ceasefire, and continuing to supply arms to Israel, our government is complicit with this slaughter."" The government has said it will continue to allow arms exports , in line with other ""like-minded countries"".

289,James Henderson's friends in 'legacy' appeal for boxing club,"Friends of a British aid worker killed by an air strike in Gaza are fundraising to help a local boxing club where he was a member. James Henderson was among seven aid workers who died in the Israeli attack . He was a member of Falmouth and Penryn Boxing Club in Cornwall which is renovating a new gym and renaming itself after Mr Henderson. Harry James-Mills, who grew up with Mr Henderson, said: ""It's a legacy that feels very important for us."" Former Royal Marine Mr Henderson, 33, who grew up in Penryn, died in the air strike on 1 April which also killed Britons John Chapman and James Kirby, as well as Australian, Palestinian, American-Canadian and Polish nationals. The group of World Central Kitchen aid workers had just unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food aid and the convoy's movements had been co-ordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to the charity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the attack as unintended and ""tragic"", and promised an independent investigation. Mr James-Mills, who knew Mr Henderson since the age of seven, said: ""Since his death it's been so interesting to see how far his reach was with so many people. ""He had his school friends, his boxing friends, his Marine friends, his friends through his work and all of those people actually really feel a strong connection with him. ""We just had our Jimmy and it's quite beautiful to see how much he meant to so many people."" His friends realised ""we're not going to be able to change what happened to Jimmy"", said Mr James-Mills. So they looked to the local community and ""what we can change positively"" and agreed to help the boxing club. The club, which has been open for 17 years, is run by volunteers. The aim is to ""raise money for years to come in Jimmy's name"", he said. Mr Henderson ""made everyone around him feel like a leader,"" he added. ""He had this ability to kind of like, keep us together, make us feel safe. ""And we had a lot of fun, he followed his boxing avidly. ""None of us were brave enough to join him, we did a few times, but we're not as tough as Jimmy was.""

290,US college protests: Hundreds more arrested across US in Gaza campus protests,"Police have arrested hundreds more protesters in locations across the US, as protests against the war in Gaza intensify across university campuses. Some 108 arrests were made at Emerson College, Boston police told the BBC's US partner CBS News. Earlier, 93 people at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles were taken into custody on trespassing charges. Protesters and police also clashed at the University of Texas in Austin. Authorities said 34 people were arrested there too. Universities across the US have seen a growing number of students walk out of class or try to set up encampments to protest against Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The latest arrests follow others at Columbia, Yale, Brown and New York University. At LA's USC, arrests were made as students gathered in Alumni Park - where the university's main-stage graduation ceremony is scheduled to take place next month. Police officers in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the centre of the campus, preventing demonstrators from gathering. Students received a 10-minute warning from police helicopters to disperse. Those who refused were arrested on trespassing charges. Kelly Munz of the Los Angeles Police Department told journalists that officers were in the area and arrived to assist the university when protesters refused to leave. ""The university is a private campus and the group had been violating the orders - it was a trespass at that point,"" Ms Munz said. On its social media channel, USC said the protest had now ended but the campus remained closed until further notice, adding: ""students with USC IDs will have access through pedestrian gates and everyone who is on campus will be able to leave."" The protest was reported to have been largely peaceful at first, but then turned tense with the continued police presence. Videos online showed protesters throwing water bottles at the police when they tried to detain one woman, chanting, ""Let her go!"" Other protesters gathered around the officers, drowning out their warnings with ""free Palestine"" chants. Students, some wearing kaffiyehs were holding ""liberated zone"" signs, banging drums. Elsewhere in the country, Boston police told CBS that three officers had been injured in the action at Emerson College - one of them seriously, though their condition was not life-threatening. No protesters were hurt, police added. Students are said to have been camping out since Sunday, allegedly ignoring warnings to leave. Emerson College has not yet commented on the arrests. In a previous statement, it said it supported the right to peaceful protests - while urging activists to comply with the law. Meanwhile at Harvard University, students braved the cold to set up more than 30 tents in front of the John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard - the oldest part of the university - on Wednesday night. They remained there on Thursday. Earlier, there were chaotic scenes on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin as hundreds of local and state police on horseback, holding batons, dispersed protesters. Governor Greg Abbott deployed the National Guard to stop the demonstrators from marching through campus, saying, they ""belong in jail"". Social media footage shows officers pushing into the crowd, while warning demonstrators on loudspeakers to leave the premises or face arrest. ""I command you in the name of the people of the state of Texas to disperse,"" the announcement said. Thirty-four people were arrested, officials said. A photographer for Fox News 7 Austin was seen falling to the ground with his camera while surrounded by riot police. The US outlet later confirmed that the cameraman was arrested. Other protesters were seen bundled to the ground by riot police. But soon afterwards around 300 demonstrators regrouped, sat on the grass under the school's iconic clock tower and chanted ""free Palestine"". Protests against Israel's war in Gaza have spread across the country after more than 100 people were arrested at New York City's Columbia University a week ago, after police tried to clear an encampment. Protesters at Columbia heckled the visiting Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, earlier on Wednesday. The entire campus had been adorned by dozens of Palestinian flags and placards with slogans such as ""real Americans stand with Gaza"", ""demilitarise education"" and ""there are no universities left in Gaza"". Last week, USC cancelled outside speakers for this year's graduation ceremony, following controversy surrounding the cancellation of the university's valedictorian speech , due to be given by Muslim student Asna Tabassum. The university said her speech should not go ahead due to security concerns, after complaints that her social media presence was antisemitic. Ms Tabassum said she was the target of ""a campaign of hate meant to silence my voice"". Across the US, protest tents have sprung up atHarvard University, the University of California - Berkeley, Yale, Emerson and the University of Michigan. Following mass arrests of Gaza solidarity activists across the US, Amnesty International published a press release urging universities ""to safeguard and facilitate all students' right to peacefully and safely protest or counter-protest on their campuses."" Pro-Israel and Jewish groups claimed some protests included antisemitic elements and said they did not feel safe as a result. At Columbia University's main campus in New York City, several Jewish students expressed concerns about a threatening campus environment. But other demonstrators argued that incidents of harassment of Jewish students had been rare and blown out of proportion by those opposed to their demands. Activists have been calling for universities to ""divest from genocide"" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza. Israel strongly denies any suggestion that it is committing genocide in the Palestinian enclave. The war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages. More than 34,305 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68895250,politics
291,Hersh Goldberg-Polin: Gaza hostage's parents urge him to 'stay strong' after new video,"The parents of an Israeli-American hostage in Gaza have urged him to ""stay strong"" and ""survive"" after Hamas released a proof-of-life video. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, is seen without his lower left arm in the short clip. It was blown off during Hamas's 7 October attack on southern Israel. The footage is undated, but he says he has been held for almost 200 days. In response, his mother and father appealed for more to be done to secure a new hostage release deal. They urged Israel, Hamas and mediators the US, Egypt and Qatar to ""get a deal done"" to reunite ""all of us with our loved ones and end the suffering in this region"". Speaking under duress in the video posted on Hamas's Telegram account on Wednesday, Mr Goldberg-Polin said he needed medical help and was critical of the Israeli government's attempts to negotiate the hostages' return. Weeks of indirect negotiations have failed to produce an agreement, with Hamas rejecting the latest proposal for a six-week ceasefire in exchange for the release of 40 of the remaining 133 hostages. At least 30 hostages are presumed dead. Israel appears to be moving ahead with plans for an offensive in Rafah, southern Gaza, despite warnings of the potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences for the 1.5 million displaced Palestinians sheltering there. Hersh Goldberg-Polin was attending the Supernova music festival on 7 October , when Hamas-led gunmen from Gaza stormed Israel's border fence, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 360 people were killed at the festival. He sought refuge in a bomb shelter with several dozen others during the attack but gunmen gathered outside and began throwing in grenades. Before Wednesday, the last time he had been seen alive was in a Hamas video that showed him being loaded on to a pick-up truck, with part of his left arm missing. In the new video, Mr Goldberg-Polin says he is ""fighting for my life with serious wounds all over my body"" and that he needs urgent medical attention. He also accuses the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government of ""abandoning"" the remaining hostages and criticises the failure to secure their release. ""Do what's expected of you already and bring us home now,"" he says. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the Goldberg-Polin family had given permission for the new video of him to be published and used. ""This distressing video serves as an urgent call to take swift and decisive action to resolve this horrific humanitarian crisis and ensure the safe return of our loved ones,"" it warned. Hersh Goldberg-Polin's father and mother also released their own video message in response. ""Seeing a video of Hersh today is overwhelming,"" Jon Polin said. ""We're relieved to see him alive but we are also concerned about his health and wellbeing, as well as that of all the other hostages and all of those suffering in this region."" He added: ""And we are here today with a plea to all of the leaders of the parties who have been negotiating to date. This includes Qatar, Egypt, the United States, Hamas and Israel. ""Be brave, lean in, seize this moment and get a deal done to reunite all of us with our loved ones and end the suffering in this region."" Rachel Goldberg-Polin then addressed her son directly, saying: ""Hersh, if you can hear this, we heard your voice today for the first time in 201 days and if you can hear us, we are telling you: 'We love you, stay strong, survive.'"" In a statement, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said: ""This psychological terror video is not only a reminder of what Hamas did on 7 October. ""It is a reminder of how sick this terror group is, terrorising the hostages and their families too."" More than 34,200 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has been conducting a military campaign to destroy Hamas and free the hostages. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages - most of them women and children - in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. On Wednesday evening, dozens of people - including friends of Mr Goldberg-Polin - protested outside the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem. Many of them held up signs saying: ""Bring them home now."" Police arrested at least two people and used foul-smelling ""skunk water"" against demonstrators who were blocking streets, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper . Police also scuffled with protesters who surrounded the car of far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir outside a synagogue. Mr Ben-Gvir waved to the angry crowd as he was ushered into the vehicle. A US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the White House had received the video of Mr Goldberg-Polin on Monday and that this was the first time Hamas had publicly released a video of an American hostage. In an interview with Israeli public broadcaster Kan on Thursday morning, Jon Polin said Israeli and US officials had told them in a telephone call about the video about an hour before it was posted online by Hamas. ""It seems to us that he is reading something that someone wrote to him,"" he said. ""But the part I'm concentrating on is the last part, which, even if he read it, he spoke straight to me, to my wife Rachel and our daughters Libby and Orly. He told us he missed us and loved us. We take it as truth. Hearing him say that made us stronger."" ""We didn't know he was alive - we thought he was, we believed he was, but we didn't know. You take power from the fact that he speaks loud and clear. I think less about what he said and more about how he said it.""",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68893885,politics
292,House speaker Mike Johnson heckled by protesters in tense Columbia campus visit,"The leader of the US House of Representatives was heckled in a tense visit to Columbia University as protests against the war in Gaza continue to spread across US campuses. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Columbia officials had lost control of the situation. He called on university president Minouche Shafik to step down. In Texas and California, police confronted campus protesters and made dozens of arrests. At Columbia, pro-Palestinian demonstrators also called for Ms Shafik's resignation over police action there against the protests. Mr Johnson held a news conference at Columbia along with other Republican lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon after briefly meeting Ms Shafik. The House Speaker dismissed suggestions that the protests were legally protected free speech. He said that Columbia had not acted to restore order on campus and had failed to protect Jewish students amid concerns about antisemitism on and around campus. ""This is dangerous,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We respect free speech, we respect diversity of ideas, but there is a way to do that in a lawful manner and that's not what this is."" ""My message to the students inside the encampment is go back to class and stop the nonsense,"" he said. The protesters, some of whom were just steps away from the podium behind a metal barrier, yelled and heckled him throughout his remarks, including chants of: ""We can't hear you."" Mr Johnson also raised the possibility of National Guard troops being called in - something New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said she had no plans to do. Students at the Ivy League university in Manhattan set up a protest encampment a week ago. On 18 April, the university asked New York city police to clear the camp, and officers arrested about 100 people. Protesters later returned to the area with more tents and placards. University officials are now negotiating with protest leaders over the size of the camp and talks are expected to continue into Thursday. Students have also been allowed to choose to attend classes online due to safety concerns. Page Fortna, a professor of political science at Columbia, told the BBC she had seen a number of ""highly objectionable"" incidents during the protests, including an Israeli flag being ripped from a student's hand, and ""extremely problematic"" comments. However, Ms Fortna added that she had seen no physical violence against Jewish students on campus and she called accusations of widespread antisemitism being made by Mr Johnson and other Republican lawmakers ""exaggerated"". ""There's a real difference in the tone of the conversation outside the gates, and what's actually happening on campus,"" she said. In interviews this week, some demonstrators argued that incidents of harassment of Jewish students had been rare and blown out of proportion by those opposed to their demands. New York police and school officials have also said ""outside agitators"" stirred up the protests. Outside the campus on Wednesday, a masked protester stood on a street corner shouting antisemitic slurs and abuse at students.Several protest camp supporters quickly confronted him, telling him that his remarks ""cheapened"" their efforts. ""This is really detrimental to the movement,"" said Caroline Daisy, a Baltimore native who came to New York to support the protesters. ""This is not an antisemitic movement but outside protesters are a different story sometimes."" On Wednesday, several Jewish students expressed concerns about a threatening campus environment. Guy Sela, an Israeli Columbia student - and a veteran of the Israel Defence Forces - told the BBC he believed ""every Israeli Jewish student"" at the university had faced ""at least one antisemitic act"", whether verbal or physical, since the protest began. ""I've been threatened here, called names like murderer, butcher and rapist, just because I was born in Israel,"" he said. Jonathan Swill, a 27-year old master's student from New Jersey, told the BBC he was moving to Israel after graduation, having turned down a place in a doctoral programme at Columbia. ""I just can't stay here anymore,"" he said. ""This place is uncomfortable for me. Every time I wake up, I dread having to come to campus. I don't know when I'm going to have things thrown at me."" Protests against Israel's war in Gaza spread across the country after the police arrests at the encampment at Columbia: Activists have been calling for universities to ""divest from genocide"" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza.

293,Searching for missing loved ones in Gaza’s mass graves,"A mother will search anywhere for her missing child. And while she has the strength, she will never stop. Whether he is alive or dead. It doesn't matter. For four days Kareema Elras has moved through the noise, dust and overpowering stench of the mass graves at Nasser hospital. She is the mother of 21-year-old Ahmed, who was killed on 25 January in the city of Khan Younis, in south central Gaza. His body has been missing since then. On Tuesday, Kareema found her boy. ""I have been coming here all the time until now,"" she said, ""until I found the body of my son, my son Ahmed, the cherished little boy, his mother's love. He lost his father when he was 12 years old, and I raised him."" Nearby, other families walk along the perimeter of the graves. It is a scene depressingly familiar from war zones around the world. The bulldozers clawing at the earth to reach the dead. An arm, stiff, extending from beneath the soil. The gravediggers marking out the individual spaces where exhumed corpses will be buried. And the families of the lost, hoping to find their loved ones among the dead. But the universality of the imagery does not necessarily suggest the same explanation. Each mass grave - whether in the Balkans, central Africa, the Middle East, or elsewhere - is the consequence of its own local conditions. In a war that has reportedly claimed the lives of more than 34,000 people in a constricted land space, burying the dead has become a complex and often dangerous task. Some cemeteries are full. Others are impossible to reach because of fighting. Because of these pressures bodies have been buried in the grounds of hospitals where Israeli forces said they fought Hamas. In some wars that I have reported on it was possible to tell reasonably quickly what had happened to the victims. This is because forensic investigators were on the scene relatively soon afterwards and journalists were able to access the area. In the current conditions in Gaza - with Israel and Egypt refusing to admit international journalists, and fighting creating extremely dangerous conditions for any potential team of forensic investigators - it is an immense challenge to specifically determine how and when each of those being exhumed from the graves at Nasser hospital and also at al-Shifa hospital, to the north in Gaza City, met their deaths. Were at least some executed by Israeli forces, as Hamas and local rescue workers claim? Or are the hundreds of dead in mass graves all the victims of air strikes and fighting in the area inside and around the medical complexes, as well as other victims of disease and malnutrition caused by the war? Did the Israelis move bodies from one grave to a new grave? By Shayan Sardarizadeh and Richard Irvine-Brown, BBC Verify BBC Verify has verified videos posted online on 22 , 25 and 28 January, which show Palestinians burying bodies at two locations in the courtyard of Nasser hospital. The footage was geolocated by using the line of double palm trees and matching visible buildings in the middle-distance. The temporary burials took place as medical staff and displaced civilians reported intense fighting in the area and after the hospital was said to have been surrounded by Israeli ground forces. We have no way of confirming precisely how many bodies were buried before the Israeli raid began on 15 February. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on 27 January that the bodies of 150 people had been buried in the hospital's courtyard, but it is nearly impossible to verify that figure. We can confirm that footage published in recent days , following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Khan Younis, shows the same burial sites. The same line of trees and surrounding buildings can be seen clearly. Gaza's civil defence force says more than 330 bodies have been recovered, but there are questions that we cannot answer about when and how those people died. Nasser hospital officials might have kept records about the bodies that were buried before the Israeli raid, but we do not know that. The Israeli military has confirmed that it did exhume and examine bodies in the courtyard to see if any were those of hostages seized by Hamas, and that they were subsequently ""returned to their place"". But Sky News has verified video and satellite imagery which shows Israeli bulldozers drove over the courtyard during their raid, causing visible damage to the site. The director of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights office for the Palestinian territories, Ajith Sunghay, told me there had to be an independent forensic investigation of the graves. On Tuesday, another UN official said that some bodies had been found with their hands tied. This followed a statement by an official of the Palestinian Civil Defence, a group which carries out rescue and recovery operations, that corpses had been found handcuffed, that others had been seen shot in the head, and some wearing detainee uniforms. Reem Zeidan spent two weeks searching for the body of her son Nabil, which was found on Wednesday afternoon. Reem said she saw bodies that had signs of torture, with their hands cuffed. ""They were executed. Some had their hands and legs cuffed together and were executed. Till when will this continue?"" I asked Mr Sunghay if he had seen solid evidence of bodies with hands tied. ""We still don't have evidence, we have information,"" he replied. ""And that information needs to be corroborated from different sources. And that's exactly why we do need an independent international investigation."" ""What we cannot allow, in this current situation where we have seen in Gaza numerous grave human rights violations, many of them potentially war crimes, and where we have raised alarm of potential atrocity crimes, that this becomes another blip. The intensity of violations has been massive."" Mr Sunghay said he had teams ready to deploy in Gaza if they were given permission and safe passage by Israel. The Israeli side has dismissed as a libel the claim that it buried bodies at the hospitals. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said: ""The claim that the IDF buried Palestinian bodies is baseless and unfounded."" The IDF added that bodies were exhumed and checked to see if any were those of hostages seized by Hamas and taken to Gaza during the 7 October attacks on Israel. The statement said: ""The examination was conducted in a careful manner and exclusively in places where intelligence indicated the possible presence of hostages. The examination was carried out respectfully while maintaining the dignity of the deceased."" The work of trying to identify and give a decent burial to the dead will continue for days to come. Somaya al-Shourbagy retrieved her husband Osama's body at Nasser hospital and managed to bring him to a cemetery to be laid to rest next to the rest of their family. She knelt by the freshly dug grave with the couple's daughter, Hind. ""My young daughter asked me to visit the grave of her father,"" Somaya said, ""and I would tell her that as soon as we bury him, we will visit him. Thank God. The situation is tough, but we might find some relief after burying him."" Little Hind, who is around five years of age, remembered her father through the clear, simple eyes of a child: ""He loved me, and used to buy things for me, and he used to take me out.""

294,"Headband was statement of faith, not pro-Hamas, court told","A man accused of wearing a headband in support of Hamas told police it was a ""statement of faith"", a court heard. Khaled Hajsaad, 24, wore the clothing at a pro-Palestine rally in central London where he was arrested by police, the prosecution said. City of London Magistrates' Court has previously been told the headband had the ""Shahada"" written on it, the basic statement of the Islamic faith. Mr Hajsaad denies a charge of appearing to support a terrorist group. A transcript of a police interview with Mr Hajsaad, conducted the day after he was arrested, was read out in court. The defendant told officers he was wearing a headband with a Saudi Arabian flag. ""I was supporting Palestine and I was wearing an item of Saudi Arabia,"" the court heard. ""This is a Shahada, which is a statement of faith. ""I was wearing it because I am a Muslim and this is my statement of faith."" Mr Hajsaad, described as an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK a year ago, said: ""I don't care about (Hamas). I don't support (the group) and I have never supported (them). ""I came here to live in safety."" He is accused of wearing the clothing at Trafalgar Square on 25 November ""in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion"" he was supporting Hamas - an illegal act in the UK where it is designated a terrorist group. Experts called to attend the court were split on the headband's likeness to either the flag of Hamas or Saudi Arabia. The trial continues.

295,Couple travel to Ukraine with donated vehicle,"A couple from Glastonbury, Somerset, have driven 1,318 miles (2,121km) to Ukraine to deliver a vehicle to the frontline in the war with Russia. Ed Chalmers and Katie Hines travelled from Oxford to Lviv, Western Ukraine, in a 4x4 they dubbed 'Hilda' which will be used to evacuate injured soldiers. Ms Hines told BBC Radio Somerset: ""As soon as we arrived in the workshop in Lviv, Hilda was immediately taken by two volunteers. ""We hadn't even switched off the engine before the vehicle was emptied, kitted out and taken off for its new life on the frontline. It was amazing."" Mr Chalmers, 36, and Ms Hines, 35, travelled for three days in a convoy of several other vehicles. The convoy was organised by Driving Ukraine - a group set up at the start of the war to deliver vehicles to the country. Mr Chalmers said: ""We drove through France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and Poland before spending two hours at the border with Ukraine sorting paperwork."" Ms Hines added: ""Hilda did really well. We had no problems mechanically but a couple of the other vehicles had problems. A few hot radiators."" Mr Chalmers said: ""We had lots of support when we were driving along. ""We met people from Norway, America and Belgium - all going in the same direction trying to provide as much aid as possible."" Ms Hines added: ""We bumped into people at services and shared stories and made connections in order to work out how best to help. ""We also had a lot of honking horns and flashing lights, so it's given us a real boost."" Mr Chalmers and Ms Hines will use a mixture of public transport to get back home to Somerset. A fundraising page has also been set up for the journey which has, so far, raised more than £5,000. Mr Chalmers said: ""The money will pay for the petrol, the paperwork to get to Ukraine and modifications to the vehicle, such as new tyres and paint.""",2024-05-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51n9keel8jo,politics
296,Derbyshire man's mission to aid autistic people in Ukraine war,"A Derbyshire journalist is fundraising to take vital supplies to autistic people in war-torn Ukraine. David Higgs MBE, who is autistic himself, wants to aid and shine a light on how war affects those with sensory issues. The project aims to raise £5,000 to cover the cost of buying at least 100 sets of ear defenders. Mr Higgs, 72, said: ""I launched this project because of my own challenges with sensory and social overload."" Alongside raising money for ear defenders, the project also aims for the funds to go towards anxiety-reducing aids suitable for autistic people. The Autism Ukraine Project is being launched after 14 months of ""intense research reaching out to Ukraine's autistic community"", said Mr Higgs, from West Hallam. ""We also intend to address some of the prejudice, stigma and misconceptions encountered by autistic people by highlighting the roles of some remarkable autistic Ukrainians acting with courage, determination, resilience and creativity to resist Putin's invasion of their country."" ""How does an autistic person cope in a war zone with explosions, evacuation and social upheaval?"" ""Many of them are on the frontlines, fighting. Many of them are in support services, many are helping with information technology. They are fighting actively to save their country."" Chief executive of Autism East Midlands, Jane Howson, said autism ""affects how people see the world"". ""Some autistic people have sensory differences and this can include being hypersensitive to some or all noise"", said Ms Howson. ""People affected in this way can experience pain or fear when exposed to trigger noises. Others might go into sensory overload and become distressed. Ear defenders can help people who are hypersensitive to noise as they block out sounds. ""Living in a conflict zone must bring with it additional challenges with regards to noise and anxiety, making it even more essential that autistic people with sensory needs have access to the right equipment."" Mr Higgs is set to depart the UK in four weeks, before motoring 4,000 miles through Ukraine to meet, document and help autistic people fighting in the war.

She added that she and her team are just a few of hundreds in the UK who have received the medal of recognition since the war began. The medal was sent back to Mrs Vickers and the group via one of the aid trucks. ""It's lovely to have and it's an absolute honour and privilege. It just shows how much our work is appreciated,"" Mrs Vickers said. The group has also received thanks from the families of refugees residing in the UK through its Facebook group and volunteer partners in Ukraine.

She's learnt to trust her instincts. It's why when Russian forces entered her home village of Ocheretyne in eastern Ukraine, she and her family decided it was time to go. However, under heavy shelling, Lidiia soon became separated from her relatives, so started walking west in her slippers. ""I took a stick and a plank of wood [for support] and made my way,"" she told the BBC. ""My legs were carrying me somehow; I wasn't carrying them!"" She would end up walking 10km (6 miles) until she was picked up by Ukrainian police. ""There's nothing left! It's all upside down!"" she could be seen telling her much-needed ride in a released video. The village she left behind is gradually being turned into a hellscape by approaching Russian troops. The closer they get, the more intense the artillery fire becomes. Entire apartment blocks and houses are slowly turning to rubble and dust. ""As I started walking, I had to lie down a couple of times,"" says Lidiia. ""I once lost balance and fell into the grass. I had a sleep, and then carried on walking."" Lidiia explains one of the officers asked how old she was. ""I said I was 48 or 49, he didn't believe me!"" she says with a chuckle. She was eventually taken to a shelter for some rest, before being reunited with her granddaughter, Svitlana. ""I'm so happy my grandmother is here!"" says Svitlana, who's sat next to Lidiia on our video call. ""We'd been looking for her for a long time!"" Extraordinary as Lidiia's journey was, she couldn't escape a telling off from her younger relative. ""I won't repeat this,"" she concedes. ""Oh no, don't do that again!"" was Svitlana's stern reply.

299,Marjorie Taylor Greene pushes to remove House speaker,"Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Wednesday that she will force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House. The conservative firebrand filed the motion last month but held off on formally introducing it, which would require a vote on Mr Johnson's fate within two legislative days. At the time, she described her action as a warning to the Republican leader. Now she has followed through on that threat. Speaker Johnson put out a statement that her motion ""is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country"". Mr Johnson's support for a $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, approved by the House on 20 April, is partially responsible for Ms Greene forcing the vote. ""Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,"" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. ""He has proven it over and over again."" On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives pledged to support Mr Johnson if his leadership was threatened - a show of gratitude for the speaker's co-operation on Ukraine aid, which was a priority for Democrats and President Joe Biden. Ms Greene called the Democratic pledge ""a warm hug and a big wet sloppy kiss"" for the speaker. Republican leaders, including former president Donald Trump, had reportedly pressured the Georgia congresswoman to back down from attempting to remove Mr Johnson, concerned that a Republican power struggle would harm the party's prospects in November's general election. Last October, Democrats voted with a handful of Republicans to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off three weeks of Republican discord as several top candidates failed to win the near-unanimous party support needed to secure the gavel. Mr Johnson ultimately prevailed -  in part because he was relatively unknown and had few connections to party leadership. But some Republicans, including Ms Greene, soured on him after he worked with Democrats to pass government funding legislation earlier this year. ""I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,"" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. ""Once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognise."" Two other Republicans in the House have said they will back Ms Greene's effort, which would be enough in the narrowly divided chamber to remove the speaker with Democratic help. Instead, the Democrats have said they will vote with pro-Johnson Republicans to ""table"" the motion, effectively killing. Ms Greene said she will introduce her motion to remove Mr Johnson next week.",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68937160,politics
300,Russia flaunts Western military hardware captured in war in Ukraine,"I'm in Victory Park, Moscow's giant memorial complex dedicated to the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. A new open-air exhibition has just opened. But it has nothing to do with World War Two. On display is Western military hardware captured by the Russian army in Ukraine. They are war trophies and Russia has decided to flaunt them. Among the armour here is a British Army Husky tactical support vehicle which had been donated to Ukraine. Its windscreen is covered in bullet-holes. Opposite the Husky I can see Western tanks that had been transferred to the Ukrainian military. There's an American Abrams which had been damaged on the battlefield. A German Leopard tank, too. In fact, there's a long line of German armour. And above it a sign: ""History is repeating itself."" The Russian authorities want the public to think that the war in Ukraine and World War Two have a common denominator: Russia as the victim, under attack from enemies abroad. In reality, the two wars are very different. In 1941 Germany invaded Russia. In 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war trophy exhibition is packed out. In bright sunshine Russians are crowding round the military hardware, posing for photographs in front of tank gun barrels and, from the sounds of it, thoroughly enjoying the display. ""It's incredible. Jaw-dropping,"" says Natalya, who's here with her husband and small daughter. ""It's amazing to think that our guys managed to get these trophies."" More than 30 armoured vehicles have been put on display. But why? The Russians have not invented the wheel here. In the past Ukraine has displayed Russian military hardware that had been captured by the Ukrainian army. But for the Russian authorities, this exhibition has, I believe, several key objectives. The first is to reinforce the Kremlin's narrative that, in Ukraine, Nato - and the West as a whole - are waging war on Russia. The aim here is to demonise the West yet further in the minds of Russians. In reality, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine: something Western leaders had urged Moscow not to do. It was President Vladimir Putin's personal decision to launch what Russia still refers to as the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. With supplies of arms and ammunition, the West came to Kyiv's defence. It does not seek to destroy Russia, despite what Russian officials may claim. Then there's the historical symbolism. Right now Victory Park is ablaze with red flags commemorating the upcoming Victory Day, the 9 May national holiday which marks Hitler's defeat. The venue for this exhibition (a World War Two memorial) and the timing (ahead of Victory Day) feed that other official narrative I mentioned earlier: the one claiming a link between World War Two and the war in Ukraine. But there's also a large element of gloating about this exhibition. Regarding the war in Ukraine, the Russians appear increasingly confident, despite the recent $61bn (£49bn) package of US assistance to Kyiv. Moscow believes it now has the initiative on the battlefield. Russia's main message is written on a big sign beside the war trophies. It reads: ""Our victory is inevitable.""",2024-05-01,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68934205,politics
301,Democrats make shock move to back Republican speaker Mike Johnson,"Top congressional Democrats announced on Tuesday that their party would throw Mike Johnson a lifeline if Republicans tried to remove him as speaker of the House of Representatives. A handful had hinted they would support Mr Johnson for going against conservatives in his own party to pass $61bn in military aid for Ukraine. ""The time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,"" the House Democratic leadership team said in a statement, implying that Republicans who opposed support for Ukraine were aiding Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. Mr Johnson, a devout evangelical Louisiana conservative who has strong right-wing views on social issues such as abortion, is now effectively leading a coalition government in the House. That may be a bitter pill to swallow for Democrats who vehemently disagree with him on policy and who believe their party could benefit from extended Republican turmoil. However, co-operation with the speaker goes beyond just aid for Ukraine. Earlier this year, Mr Johnson relied on Democratic votes to approve new operational funding for the US government, preventing a partial shutdown in services and keeping many of the Democratic spending priorities intact. Three weeks ago, he rebuffed members of his own party to re-authorise a controversial national security surveillance programme. Some conservatives had been pushing for his removal even before Ukraine reached the floor. In March, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion that would trigger a vote on his removal. She warned on Tuesday that she would soon bring that motion to a vote. ""I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes,"" she said on social media. ""Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display,"" she added, using a term popularised by those who claim there is no real difference between Democrats and establishment Republicans. However, rank-and-file House Republicans seem uneasy with the prospect of a new battle, just six months after the previous speaker, Kevin McCarthy, was booted from the job. It took three weeks of intra-party wrangling and acrimony before Mr Johnson, a relative unknown, won the job with unanimous Republican support. Donald Trump has been a key, and somewhat unlikely, ally for Mr Johnson throughout this recent challenge to his leadership. The former president, and presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has offered words of praise for the embattled speaker, saying in a radio interview last week that he is a ""good person"" who is ""trying very hard"". He noted that Mr Johnson has had to work with a razor-thin Republican Party majority in the chamber. Democratic support for Mr Johnson, along with Mr Trump's continued backing, is likely to secure his hold on power at least through to November's election for all 435 House seats. If Republicans retain control of the chamber - which is far from guaranteed - Mr Johnson will not be able to count on Democratic support, however, opening the possibility of another moment of reckoning among conservatives. For now, however, Mr Johnson said he was focusing on doing his job. ""We have to do what we believe to be the right thing,"" he told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday. ""What the country needs right now is a functioning Congress.""",2024-04-30,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68933018,politics
302,Zelensky: Russia taking advantage of slow arms delivery,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia is taking advantage of the slow delivery of Western weapons to go on the offensive. His comments come after the US agreed a $61bn (£49bn) package of mostly military aid for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky said some of the aid had started to arrive, but added that it needed to be delivered faster. He was speaking alongside Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, who said ""it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail"". The comments come after authorities in the Black Sea port of Odesa said a Russian missile attack had killed four people and injured 32. Odesa's regional head Oleh Kiper said three women and one man had died, and the injured included a four-year-old and a 16-year-old, as well as a pregnant woman. Civilian houses and infrastructure had been damaged, he said. Earlier on Monday, Russia said it had taken a second village in two days in the course of its offensive in eastern Ukraine. At a joint press conference in Kyiv, President Zelensky said: ""The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of a situation when we are waiting for supplies from our partners, especially from the United States of America. ""And that is exactly why the speed of deliveries means stabilising the front."" He specifically singled out Ukraine's need for artillery shells and air defence systems. ""Our partners have all of these things and they should be working now here in Ukraine destroying the Russian terrorist ambitions. ""Russia's army is preparing for further offensive actions,"" said Mr Zelensky. Mr Stoltenberg agreed that Kyiv needed weapons, saying that ""Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition"". The Nato chief said the six-month delay in US military aid had resulted in ""serious consequences on the battlefield"". But Mr Stoltenberg added that he was optimistic that when the arms were delivered it would help turn the tide. ""Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs,"" said the Nato chief. Mr Stoltenberg also stressed that Ukraine would one day become a Nato member - a key strategic goal for Kyiv; but added that an official invitation at the alliance's Washington summit in July was unlikely. Russia said it had captured the village of Semenivka, which lies north of Avdiivka which Moscow took in February . On Sunday, Russia said the nearby village of Novobakhmutivka had fallen to its forces. Ukraine's commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said the situation on the frontline has worsened in the face of multiple Russian attacks, and that Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from positions in the eastern Donetsk region. Also on Monday, Ukraine's interior ministry said a 98-year-old woman had walked more than 10km (six miles) with two sticks under shelling from the partially occupied by Russia eastern village of Ocheretyne to Kyiv-controlled areas. ""I survived that war [World War Two], and I am going through this war,"" the woman, named only as Lidiya Stepanivna, is heard saying in the footage at an aid centre. She said she fell several times and had to rest on the ground during her escape. ""This war is not like that one,"" she added. ""Houses are burning and trees are being uprooted."" Earlier this month, the US finally approved billions of dollars in new military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion, putting an end to six months of congressional deadlock and raising Kyiv's hopes that its dwindling supplies would be restocked. Ukrainian forces have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defence systems in recent months. Officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68923225,politics
303,Sophie becomes first royal in Ukraine with surprise visit,"The Duchess of Edinburgh has become the first member of the Royal Family to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion. On Monday she went on a one-day visit, on behalf of the Foreign Office, to ""demonstrate solidarity with the women, men and children impacted by the war"". The duchess paid her respects to those who had lost their lives in the town of Bucha during the Russian occupation. There was also a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Royal Family has been unusually outspoken in its support of Ukraine, with King Charles marking the second anniversary of the invasion in February by warning of the ""indescribable aggression"" and the ""unprovoked attack"" by Russia. On his state visits to France and Germany the King had spoken of the importance of supporting Ukraine - and the sympathies of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, had been suggested when she appeared beside a big bowl of flowers in Ukrainian national colours. But up to now none of the royals had come to Ukraine during the war, until this surprise visit by Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, who is married to Prince Edward, the King's youngest brother. During her trip Sophie talked to survivors of sexual violence and torture, and at an evening reception at the residence of the UK ambassador to Ukraine, Martin Harris, spoke about her experience meeting survivors in other countries marred by conflict. ""Women and girls pay the highest price in terms of human costs,"" she said, adding: ""Rape is used to demean, to degrade and to destroy."" Sophie also heard from children who had been returned to Ukraine after being forcibly separated from their families and visited a bridge which was blown up to stop Russian soldiers advancing on Kyiv. In her meeting with President Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska, the duchess gave them a private message from King Charles and discussed support for survivors of sexual violence in conflicts. The duchess has been a supporter of the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative - and Queen Camilla recently spoke of the importance of preventing the sexual violence that all too often takes place in war zones . This unexpected visit is a symbolic message of royal support for Ukraine. Soon after the start of the war in 2022, Charles, then Prince of Wales, visited Ukrainian refugees who had come across the border into Romania. Prince William also visited British troops in Poland near to the Ukrainian border . The royals also appeared to have become embroiled in the disinformation war - with the British Embassy in Russia having to say that claims that the King had died were fake news. Security researchers also warned that social media conspiracy theories about the Princess of Wales were being amplified by Russian disinformation networks. But Sophie has gone a step further with her visit into Ukraine. It adds to her list of trips to places not usually visited by the royals. Last year she became the first royal to visit Baghdad in Iraq, again addressing the issue of violence against women and attending events supporting better access to education for girls. She has also visited Kosovo, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",2024-04-29,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68922333,politics
304,"Situation on frontline has worsened, Ukraine army chief says","Ukraine's commander-in-chief has said the situation on the frontline has worsened in the face of multiple Russian attacks. Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from positions in the eastern Donetsk region. Russia is trying to take advantage of its superiority in manpower and artillery before Ukrainian forces get much-needed supplies of new US weapons. The US last week agreed a $61bn (£49bn) package of military aid for Ukraine. But new US weapons are yet to make their way to the frontlines, where Ukrainian troops have been struggling for months with a shortage of ammunition, troops and air defences. ""The situation at the front has worsened,"" Gen Syrskyi said in a post on the Telegram messaging service on Sunday. He confirmed Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from some of their positions in an area of Donetsk that had formed part of a defensive line, established after Russia captured Avdiivka in February. Much of the fighting has been taking place around Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing Avdiivka. New defensive lines had been taken up further to the west in some areas, with Gen Syrskyi conceding the loss of territory to the advancing Russians. Moscow had secured ""tactical successes in some sectors,"" he said. Gen Syrskyi added that rested Ukrainian brigades were being rotated in those areas to replace units that had suffered losses. Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday reported its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka, around 10 km (6 miles) north of Avdiivka. Gen Syrskyi became commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces in February. It followed speculation about a rift between his predecessor, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier this month, Gen Syrskyi warned the battlefield situation in the east of the country had ""significantly worsened"". The commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said this week that he was expecting an attempt by Russian forces to advance on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, which is near the Russian border. US President Joe Biden this week signed off on a $95bn (£76bn) package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after months of gridlock amid opposition to the aid from some in Congress. The Senate passed a similar aid package in February, but a group of conservatives who oppose new Ukraine support had prevented it from coming to a vote in the House of Representatives. On Friday, the Pentagon said it would ""rush"" Patriot air defence missiles and artillery ammunition to Ukraine as part of its new military aid package. Between February 2022 and January 2024, the US gave Ukraine more than $40bn in military aid, according to German research organisation, the Kiel Institute.",2024-04-28,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68916317,politics
305,Pentagon to 'rush' Patriot missiles to Ukraine in $6bn package,"The Pentagon says it will ""rush"" Patriot air defence missiles and artillery ammunition to Ukraine as part of its new military aid package. However Patriot systems for launching the missiles will not be sent, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Patriots were ""urgently"" needed to face a growing Russian air threat and ""can and should save lives right now"". On Saturday, Ukraine said Russia had carried out another massive air attack. Authorities in Kharkiv said a hospital was damaged. Energy facilities in three regions were attacked, Energy Minister German Galushchenko said. Russia attacked with cruise missiles, S-300 surface-to-air missiles and Iskander ballistic missiles, Ukraine said, adding that 21 were downed using aircraft, air defence systems and jamming. Ukraine claimed to have hit two Russian oil refineries across the border. Footage from one in the Russian region of Krasnodar appeared to have caused a large explosion, though local authorities denied significant damage. Russian authorities said on Saturday they had shot down some 68 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Speaking on Friday, Mr Austin told a news conference that the US was committing to its largest security assistance package to date and would ""move immediately"" to get the supplies to Ukraine. The US was using $6bn (£4.8bn) for this purpose, he said. A source confirmed to the BBC that the $6bn was part of a $60bn aid package signed into law by US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, which also includes $1bn in more immediate aid. The assistance would include air defence munitions, counter-drone systems and artillery ammunition but not Patriot missile systems. ""It's not just Patriots that they [the Ukrainians] need, they need other types of systems and interceptors as well,"" Mr Austin said. ""I would caution us all in terms of making Patriot the silver bullet."" Mr Austin added that he was confident that more of the missile systems would be made available for Kyiv soon. Conversations were ongoing with European partners, he said, to deliver additional capabilities. The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Brown, said the assistance should eliminate the Ukrainians' need to ration shells on the frontline. Some of the latest funding would also go to building up Ukraine's own defence industry, so that it can start manufacturing more of the ammunition it desperately needs. Mr Austin said Russia had already increased domestic production of artillery ammunition and other weapons - as well as being propped up by supplies from Iran and North Korea. ""Understand what's at stake for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the United States,"" he said. ""If Putin prevails in Ukraine - Europe would face a security threat it hasn't seen in a lifetime. Russia will not stop in Ukraine."" Asked whether the US aid would protect Ukrainian forces, Mr Austin said that the commitment was ""material, real, and substantial"" although ""not instantaneous"". ""It's going to take some time to get it in there and distribute. The Ukrainians were able to hold - with this capability, they can do a lot better."" The defence secretary's words came as Ukraine warned on Friday that Russia was ramping up attacks on its railways. A Ukrainian security source told the AFP news agency that Moscow wanted to damage Ukrainian railway infrastructure to ""paralyse deliveries and movement of military cargo"". Ukraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. Germany has already promised an extra Patriot system - and its defence and foreign ministers appealed to their European counterparts earlier this month to respond urgently. Greece has stocks of Patriots and S-300s but said none could be spared. ""We explained why we cannot do it,"" Greek  Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis told Skai TV. His said his country's air defences were ""critical systems for the protection of Greek air space"". According to reports, Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system. Recent months have seen Kyiv step up its calls for Western assistance as its stocks of ammunition are depleted and Russia makes steady gains. Ukrainian officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory.",2024-04-27,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68901820,politics
306,Ukraine war: Kyiv's plea for Patriots falls short in Greece and Spain,"Greece has rejected pressure from European allies to help Ukraine boost its air defences, arguing that Athens needs the systems for itself. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed for at least seven more Patriots or similar defence batteries to protect its cities and power plants from Russian attack. But Greece has said it cannot spare any of its Patriot or S-300 systems. Reports say Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system. Spain and Greece have come under pressure to help Ukraine from both Nato and European Union allies, in response to attacks on vulnerable cities including Chernihiv and power facilities in Kharkiv and close to Kyiv. Ukraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300. Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. President Zelensky said on Friday that Russian jets had targeted Ukraine with more than 9,000 ""guided aerial bombs"" so far this year and Kyiv needed to be able to shoot their planes down. ""We urgently need better systems. And missiles for them to save lives right now,"" he told a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, an alliance of Nato members and partner countries. Germany has already promised an extra Patriot, and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $6bn weapons programme on Friday, to include missile intercepts for Patriot and Nasam (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) air defence systems. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg has suggested that Ukraine's allies have not provided support they promised. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell said this week: ""The Patriots are in the capitals. And it's up to them to take the decisions."" Greece in particular has stocks of Patriots and S-300s. But Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis has ruled out handing any to Kyiv. ""We explained why we cannot do it,"" he told Skai TV. His said his country's air defences were ""critical systems for the protection of Greek air space"". Athens has provided Kyiv with weapons and ammunition but is wary of losing any of its deterrent capability because of potential flare-ups with neighbour Turkey, even though relations at the moment are relatively stable. Spain's military has three Patriot batteries, but argues that it needs them and can only provide a ""very limited number"" of Patriot missiles because its reserve is low, sources have told El País newspaper. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. The continuing dilemma for Ukraine's military commanders is where to place the missile systems, close to the country's vulnerable cities or near the front line where Russia's advances are most intense. Recent Russian successes have been characterised by greater use of airpower. Su-34 fighter bombers have been dropping precision-guided munitions on Ukrainian forces. We do not know where Ukraine place their SAM systems, but mitigating this growing Russian aerial threat might mean missile defence concentrates on the eastern front line. That risks taking away a degree of missile defence for key cities and important areas of infrastructure - the sort of areas that have been regularly pounded by Russian cruise missiles and attack drones. That is why Ukraine has been pleading for greater missile defences to plug the gaps in vulnerable areas. Russia's latest strikes have targeted Ukraine's railway system in three regions. Rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia said three of its mechanics were killed in a Russian missile attack while they were working in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday. Russia said it hit a train carrying Western weapons and military hardware near Udachne, about 45km (28 miles) from the front line. Thirteen people were also wounded in a strike on a train station in Balakliya, in the Kharkiv region, and officials said a passenger train was 15m (50ft) from the station when it came under attack. In a separate Russian attack, rail infrastructure was damaged in the central Cherkasy region. Meanwhile, Ukraine has had to pull back US M1 Abrams battle tanks from the front line, according to a report by the Associated Press. Thirty-one Abrams tanks were originally provided to help Ukrainian forces operate on the battlefield, but Russia's increased use of drones has made the tanks harder to protect and five have been lost, AP reported.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68903480,politics
307,Blinken says China helping fuel Russian threat to Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned Washington will act if China does not stop supplying Russia with items used in its assault on Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC in Beijing, the US's top diplomat said he had made clear to his counterparts they were ""helping fuel the biggest threat"" to European security since the Cold War. He did not say what measures the US was prepared to take. But Mr Blinken was also keen to stress progress had been made in some areas. He praised Beijing for making efforts in stopping supplies of the drug fentanyl reaching the US. China remains the principal source of fentanyl for the US, which the White House has said is causing a public health crisis across the country. Mr Blinken also stressed he felt Beijing can play a ""constructive"" role in the Middle East, pointing towards China using ""its relationship with Iran to urge"" against further escalation in its confrontation with Israel. The visit - the second in 10 months made by Mr Blinken - forms part of a significant increase in dialogue and diplomacy between these rival powers as they attempt to put relations on an even keel after a period of immense tension last year. Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained by China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea, and US export bans on advanced tech. They were further damaged by a row over a spy balloon last February. In recent days, the US passed a law that would force Chinese-owned TikTok to sell the hugely popular video app or be banned in America - something Mr Blinken earlier revealed had not come up in his meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi - who met Mr Blinken on Friday afternoon in Beijing's Great Hall of the People - agreed the two sides had ""made some positive progress"" since he met his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November. He added the countries should ""be partners, not rivals"", saying that if the US took ""a positive view of China's development"", relations could ""truly stabilise, get better and move forward"". Mr Blinken told the BBC that one of the key routes for ""better relations"" between China and both the US and Europe would be for Beijing ""or some of its enterprises"" to stop providing ""critical components"" that help Russia make more munitions. The components include items such as ""machine tools, micro-electronics, and optics"". ""It's helping Russia perpetuate its aggression against Ukraine, but it's also creating a growing threat to Europe because of Russia's aggression,"" he explained, adding it was ""helping to fuel the biggest threat to [Europe's] insecurity since the end of the Cold War"". ""We've taken action already against Chinese entities that are engaged in this,"" he said. ""And what I make clear today is that if China won't act, we will."" Mr Blinken - who hinted at sanctions as a possible route - was keen to stress that China was not directly supplying Russia with weapons. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Blinken said it remained important to see if the two countries could ""build greater cooperation in areas where we have mutual interest"", including artificial intelligence and military communications.",2024-04-26,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68905475,politics
308,Ukraine weapons: What arms are being supplied and why are there shortages?,"The US will start giving Ukraine crucial new weapons, after President Joe Biden approved additional military aid worth almost $61bn (£49bn). In particular, Ukraine needs more missiles and shells to stop Russian forces making further gains on the battlefield. The aid for Ukraine is part of a $95bn (£76bn) package which also includes military support for Israel and Taiwan . The supply of US weapons to Ukraine dried up in early 2024, because a bill to grant more aid was delayed in Congress. But President Biden said the US can now start sending armaments ""right away"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the commitment ""reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and leader of the free world"". The aid package includes at least $8bn (£6.5bn) to re-supply Ukraine with missiles and ammunition . Prime minister Rishi Sunak has also confirmed the UK will provide an extra £500m on top of the £2.5bn in military aid it had already pledged to give Ukraine in 2024. This will pay for extra missiles, ammunition, armoured vehicles and all terrain vehicles . In February 2024, the EU agreed a further €50bn (£42bn; $54bn) aid package for Ukraine , after Hungary stopped blocking the deal. The EU failed to meet its target of sending one million shells to Ukraine by the beginning of March. However, the Czech Republic agreed a $1.5bn deal for a group of 18 Nato and EU countries to buy 800,000 rounds - both 155mm and 122mm calibre - from outside the EU. Between February 2022 and the end of February 2024, the US delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $46.2bn to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute, a German research organisation . Over the same period, Germany gave Ukraine weapons and equipment worth $10.7bn, the UK $5.7bn, Denmark $5.2bn, and the Netherlands $4.1bn. The US had warned that Ukraine's military is running short on munitions and morale is low. One key shortage is of air defence missiles. President Zelensky said Ukraine needs ""seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems"" to protect its cities . These would allow Ukraine to ""counter Russia's glide bombs, which [Moscow] is using to pound defensive positions and civilian targets like power stations,"" says Dr Marina Miron, of King's College London. Russia has carried out repeated air attacks on Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, which is near the Russian border. The commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said Russian forces may start to advance on the city. Ukrainian armed forces have also been limited to firing 2,000 shells a day, according to the UK-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). In contrast, Russian forces have been firing up to 10,000 shells a day, Rusi said. It said Russia gets almost three million shells a year from its own factories and from North Korea. Ukraine has lost 583 sq km (225 square miles) of territory in the east of the country to Russian forces since October 2023, largely because of a lack of artillery. It blamed shortages for the loss of the town of Avdiivka in February. The resumption of US ammunition supplies means Ukraine could start using more artillery shells from its stocks, says Justin Crump, of risk intelligence company Sibylline. ""Until now, Ukrainian forces have been rationing shell use because they haven't been able to tell when new supplies are coming,"" he says. Anti-tank weapons Western countries responded to Russia's invasion in February 2022 by giving Ukraine's armed forces defensive weapons, to counter Russia's armoured brigades. The US and UK supplied thousands of Javelin and Nlaw anti-tank missiles. These were considered crucial in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv. Air defence systems To counter Russian air superiority, and its attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, Western nations sent Ukraine several types of air defence system. These range from the UK's short-range anti-aircraft weapon, Starstreak, to the Patriot missile system. Patriots are expensive to operate - one missile costs about $3m. The US and Norway have also provided the Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) for air defence, and Germany has offered the Iris-T. Artillery and missiles After Russia's retreat from Kyiv, the war became focused on the east of the country. Artillery and missiles were heavily used by both sides. Australia, Canada, the US and others sent M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine. The US and UK also provided missile systems including Himars, and the M270 MLRS. Ukraine has also received long-range missiles such as Scalp from France, Storm Shadow from the UK and ATACMS from the US. The US has also supplied Ukraine with the longest-range version of ATACMS , which can travel 190 miles (300km). Before April 2024, it had only provided a shorter range version. In July 2023, the US said it had supplied cluster bombs to Ukraine, to help dislodge Russian troops from defensive positions. These weapons, delivered mostly in artillery shells, scatter multiple bomblets, and are banned by more than 100 countries because of the risk they pose to civilians . In early 2023, Western nations agreed to send tanks to Ukraine. It was hoped they would enable Ukraine to breach Russian defensive lines. The UK provided the Challenger 2. The US sent 31 Abrams tanks, and European nations have sent several German-made Leopard 2 tanks. The US-built M1 Abrams has been described as the most advanced tank in the world. However, none of this new armour enabled Ukraine to make a major breakthrough in its counter-offensive. Drones have featured heavily throughout the war, for surveillance, targeting, launching missiles and as ""kamikaze"" weapons. Turkey supplied missile-firing Bayraktar TB2 drones at the start of the war, the US has provided ""Switchblade"" kamikaze drones, and several countries have sent commercial surveillance drones, such as the Chinese-made DJI Mavic 3. In February 2024, the UK government said it would join a coalition of countries supplying Ukraine with thousands of ""first person view"" drones , for observation and target spotting. Ukraine has consistently asked the US for fighter jets, to counter Russia's air superiority. In May 2023, President Joe Biden agreed to let other nations supply it with US-made F-16s. Denmark and the Netherlands offered to donate planes. Ukrainian pilots have been learning how to fly them in 11 Western countries.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62002218,politics
309,Ukraine war: Kyiv uses longer-range US missiles for first time,"Ukraine has begun using longer-range ballistic missiles against Russia that were secretly provided by the US, American officials have confirmed. The weapons were sent as part of a previous US support package, and arrived this month. Officials said they were not announced publicly to maintain Ukraine's ""operational security"". They have already been used at least once to strike Russian targets in occupied Crimea. Further US aid is now heading to Kyiv. More American weaponry is expected to be sent imminently, after President Joe Biden signed off on Wednesday a new package of economic and military support for Ukraine worth $61bn (£49bn). The missiles that have already been quietly provided are the longer-range version of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), a state department spokesman confirmed on Wednesday. The US previously supplied Ukraine with a mid-range version of the ATACMS, but had resisted sending anything more powerful, partly over concerns about compromising US military readiness. Officials were also concerned that the Ukrainians could use the weaponry to strike inside Russian territory, causing the conflict to escalate, according to NBC, which first reported the news. The Ukrainians have long called for the systems, which can fire missiles up to 300km (186 miles). Mr Biden is said to have secretly given the green light in February. Briefing reporters on Wednesday, the state department spokesman confirmed that the provision of the longer-range ATACMS had been ""at the president's direct direction"". The US ""did not announce this at the onset in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request"", Vedant Patel explained. It is not clear how many of the weapons have already been sent, but US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington planned to send more. ""They will make a difference. But as I've said before at this podium... there is no silver bullet,"" he said. The longer-range ATACMS give Ukraine the ability to strike deeper into Russian-held areas; particularly bases, storage facilities and logistics hubs. They were used for the first time last week to strike a Russian airfield in occupied Crimea, US media reported, and then in an attack on Russian troops in the occupied port city of Berdyansk overnight on Tuesday. Russia said on Wednesday that the new weaponry ""will not fundamentally change the outcome"" of the war. Recent months have seen Kyiv step up its calls for Western assistance as its stocks of ammunition are depleted and Russia makes steady gains. The new aid package that was rubber-stamped by Mr Biden on Wednesday follows months of gridlock amid opposition to the aid from some in Congress. A billion-dollar weapons package is expected to be the first of many from the $61bn of fresh aid, not all of which will be spent on arms. US security assistance previously sent to Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion totals $44bn. ""It's going to make America safer, it's going to make the world safer,"" the US president said after signing the new aid into law. Reacting to the package, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""Now we will do everything to make up for half a year spent in debates and doubts. ""What the Russian occupier was able to do during this time, what Putin is now planning, we must turn against him."" Mr Zelensky recently warned that a Russian offensive was expected in the coming weeks after Ukraine's loss of the city of Avdiivka during the winter. Ukrainian forces have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defence systems in recent months and officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory. Mr Sullivan said on Wednesday it was ""certainly possible that Russia could make additional tactical gains in the coming weeks"". Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, tens of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured on both sides and millions of people have fled their homes.

310,Georgia foreign agents bill draws protesters on to the streets,"For the last 10 days, thousands of Georgians - many in their late teens and early 20s - have been bringing the traffic of the capital, Tbilisi, to a standstill. They demand that the government scrap plans to introduce a controversial bill - dubbed the ""foreign agent"" law - many say is inspired by authoritarian legislation neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. On 17 April, parliament passed the bill in its first reading - the first of three barriers it must overcome before becoming law. ""I am here for my European future,"" says 23-year old Gvantsa ""Pertso"" as she sits with her friends next to the Georgian parliament, a meeting point for rallies. She is among members of Georgia's Gen Z who have been marching through Tbilisi with EU and Georgian flags draped around their shoulders, holding banners and chanting: ""No to the Russian law!"" Under the bill proposed by the ruling Georgian Dream party - which has been in power for the last 12 years - NGOs and independent media that receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors would have to register as organisations ""bearing the interests of a foreign power"". They would also be monitored by the Justice Ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 GEL ($9,400; £7,500). Because NGOs and civil society organisations in Georgia are involved in election monitoring, protesters are also concerned the bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of the parliamentary elections later this year. Parallels have been drawn with an authoritarian bill which came into force in Russia in 2012, and which the Russian government has since used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups. Many are also worried that such a law will derail Georgia from its path towards the much-coveted EU membership which - as a poll by the US National Democratic Institute showed - is supported by nearly 80% of Georgians. Georgia was granted EU candidate status in December 2023 - but now both Brussels and Washington have said the adoption of the foreign agents law would be detrimental to Georgia's European ambitions. A number of European leaders have warned the proposed bill is ""incompatible"" with European norms and values, including European Council President Charles Michel, who said the law would ""bring Georgia further away from the EU and not closer"". But Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is standing firm. He has accused NGOs of attempting to stage revolutions in Georgia twice, of promoting ""gay propaganda"" and of attacking the Georgian Orthodox Church. He and his government insist the bill is about ensuring transparency, and rejects the notion that it is against European values - or that Russia is behind the legislation. In fact, Georgian Dream has sought to distance itself from Russia over the bill, flatly rejecting any perceived similarity with the Russian law as ""disinformation"" and denouncing Russian messaging about the protests in Georgia as inflammatory. Tamar Oniani, a representative of the Georgian Young Lawyers Association NGO, is sceptical. She has been protesting against the bill, which she says is about ""suppressing civil society"" and ""in the interest of Russia."" ""That's why we are here,"" she tells the BBC from the sidelines of a protest. ""We think that it is an issue of foreign policy for Georgia, because it would shift us from EU to Russia."" Anna Dolidze, of the opposition party For The People, says that the law is a Russian ""test of allegiance"" for the Georgian Dream party, whose task is to ""pass this law and remain softly authoritarian… through the indirect silencing of critics."" Referring to similar legislation passed in neighbouring Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan, Ms Dolidze says: ""Countries that are pro-Russian in the so-called Russian neighbourhood have been asked to pass this law… as a way to create a divide between them and Europe."" In Kyrgyzstan, the Open Society Foundations NGO has recently said it would end its operations after three decades in the country following the introduction of a foreign agents bill. The new law risks ""an overwhelmingly negative impact on civil society, human rights defenders, and the media in Kyrgyzstan,"" the NGO said in a statement. For its part, Russia has rubbished allegations of meddling. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the protests against the Georgian government's bill were provoked by foreign forces who wanted to stir up anti-Russian sentiment in the country - but denied that Russia had any connection to the legislation. Analysts disagree. Sopo Gelava, a disinformation specialist with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, says that pro-Kremlin Facebook pages have been spreading claims that the West is behind the protests and pushing the narrative that the US is ""planning a coup"" in Georgia ahead of the October parliamentary elections. ""At least five pages that I'm looking at the moment have a sponsored post claiming that there is a secret plan to overthrow the government,"" Ms Gelava says. Protesters in Tbilisi have few doubts that this is a crossroads moment, and continue taking to the streets to vent their anger towards the government. Protests have now become a daily sight in Tbilisi, and show few signs of abating. ""Nine out of ten people in the street will say that our destination is Europe,"" says student Andria Chilaidze. ""I don't know why [government officials] are doing this."" Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili, who is in a bitter dispute with the government, told the BBC that questions remained over who might be behind its renewed push to adopt the law. ""Is it in Georgia or is it beyond our borders, is it in Moscow that this decision has been taken?"" she asked. ""That is the main question about transparency that the Georgian population is asking.""

311,Jeremy Hunt defends civil service job cuts to increase defence spending,"Jeremy Hunt has defended plans to slash civil service jobs to increase defence spending and Ukraine aid, during a surprise trip to Kyiv. The chancellor said cutting public services will cost ""a great deal less"" compared to allowing Russia to succeed. The government has pledged to increase UK military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2030. Mr Hunt confirmed the increase will cost an extra £20bn, which unions claim will be funded by cutting 70,000 jobs. Downing Street said the plans would be funded through existing commitments to reduce the civil service headcount to pre-Covid levels, and giving the ministry of defence (MoD) a share of an already-announced increase in government research spending. The Public and Commercial Services Union said cutting civil servants' jobs to pay for higher defence spending would lead to longer waiting lists for new passports, driving tests and driving licence. The announcement comes after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the UK would provide an additional £500m for Ukraine this year, on top of £2.5bn already allocated. Mr Sunak added that the UK could continue to provide ""at least the current level of military support to Ukraine for every year it is needed"". Speaking in Kyiv after a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Hunt said he hope the increased funding would be ""a turning point in this war"". ""We think other European countries will follow us and that will send a message to Putin that he is not going to succeed,"" Mr Hunt said. The ""UK has a special role"" in supporting the Ukraine war effort, because ""we have the largest defence budget in Europe,"" he added. ""I'm here because if we want to restore peace in Europe, we must make sure that Putin does not succeed with his evil war of aggression right here in Ukraine,"" he said. On shrinking the civil service to pay for defence spending and Ukraine aid, he said: ""This is a choice but the choice we are making is to invest in European security and defence. ""And if we stop Putin doing what he is trying to do in Ukraine, in the end, it will cost all of us a great deal less. ""I think it is reasonable to reduce the civil service to the size it was pre-Covid, and I'm confident we can do that with more efficient delivery of public services."" Mr Hunt confirmed the spending, which will gradually increase over the next six years, would be £20bn more than if spending stayed at its current level of 2.3% of GDP. The additional funding will also help resource MoD programmes already under way - such as an order for new naval frigates, the development of a new fighter jet, and the modernisation of Britain's nuclear weapons systems. These programmes are proving to be very expensive and the MoD has been struggling to make ends meet on its existing resources. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said on Tuesday his party ""wants to see a fully funded plan"" to reach this level. But the Tories had ""shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted on defence"", he added. He said Labour would review resources for the armed forces within a year of taking office, if it wins the general election later this year.",2024-04-25,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68893859,politics
312,What $61bn US aid boost could mean for Ukraine,"A $61bn package of military aid for Ukraine has been passed by the US Senate and is headed to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. So what weapons might Ukraine receive and what difference could they make in trying to stem Russian advances? The most pressing weaponry needed by Ukraine falls into three categories: air defence systems, mid to long-range missiles and artillery shells. Here is where the US aid could go in these areas. Repelling the Russian threat from the skies is vital for the protection of cities and critical infrastructure such as energy plants. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had been attacked by almost 1,200 Russian missiles, more than 1,500 drones and 8,500 guided bombs this year alone. Ukraine has a variety of western-supplied systems ranging from shoulder-launched Stinger short range missiles all the way up to the advanced - and extremely expensive - Patriot system. Zelensky said at least seven more Patriots, or their equivalent, were needed. Russia's cruise and ballistic missiles - including converted S-300 and S-400 surface to air missiles - along with hundreds of Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones - are difficult to counter because of the sheer volumes launched. A classic tactic to overwhelm air defences is to swamp them with targets, thereby occupying their acquisition and tracking radar systems and depleting missile stocks. But the war on the ground is vital. Since October, Ukraine has lost nearly 583 square kilometres (225 square miles) of its eastern territory to Russian forces, largely because of a lack of artillery. High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) have played a crucial role for Ukraine, by delivering guided munitions from a mobile platform. Arrive at location, set-up, fire and quickly move on before Russian forces can locate and attack the launcher. Expect more HIMARS capability in Ukraine, and perhaps a commitment for more tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Significantly, the long-range version of the US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) has recently arrived in Ukraine. Older ATACMS systems have been in the country since late last year, but the newer version can double ranges to 300km (186 miles). It takes the fight deeper into annexed Crimea, which Russia uses as a major naval base protected by air assets, and beyond. And let's not forget bread-and-butter weapons. M777 howitzers need to be fed a continuous diet of 155mm artillery shells. The United States has sent 2,000,000 such shells to Ukraine since February 2022 and more will likely be sent in this latest package. The United States has what it calls a ""very robust logistics network"" to get arms there quickly - within days, it says. Supplies are likely to have been moved closer to Ukraine, and once they are handed over they officially become the property of Ukraine. But getting the gear to the frontline - the artillery equipment particularly - could take many days or even weeks, as Russian forces continue their pounding in the east. Last week, Russia said it would increase the intensity of strikes on logistics centres and storage depots holding Western weapons. These pre-date this tranche of cash but are notable now because they are close to coming into service. Ukrainian pilots and crews continue their conversion training to western F-16 jets, currently in Romania. These multi-role aircraft provide a stronger air-to-air and air-to-ground capability, thereby potentially improving Ukrainian air defences. Denmark, the Netherlands and the US expect to deliver the first of dozens of ""Vipers"" to Ukraine within months. The jets won't be a game-changer but another significant arrow in the quiver for Kyiv. Moscow has been dismissive, saying the F-16s wouldn't make much of a difference on the battlefield and would be shot down by Russian forces.",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68872783,politics
313,"War in Ukraine: US to send new aid right away, Biden says","US President Joe Biden has signed a $95bn (£76bn) package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. ""It's going to make America safer, it's going to make the world safer,"" he said after signing the bill into law. The president said the US would ""right away"" send fresh weapons and equipment to Ukraine to help Kyiv fend off Russian advances. He spoke a day after the US Senate approved the aid package following months of congressional gridlock. Ukraine has recently stepped up its calls for Western assistance as Russia makes steady gains in its invasion. Included in the package is $61bn in military aid for Ukraine. It passed the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 79-18. Tuesday evening's approval came after the measure passed the US House of Representatives on Saturday. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""After more than six months of hard work and many twists and turns in the road, America sends a message to the entire world: we will not turn our back on you."" Reacting to the vote, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it ""reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and leader of the free world"". The Senate passed a similar aid package in February, but a group of conservatives who oppose new Ukraine support had prevented it from coming to a vote in the House of Representatives. Last week, Democrats and Republicans in the lower chamber joined together to bypass this opposition. They ultimately agreed to a package bill that included the foreign aid as well as legislation to confiscate Russian assets held by Western banks; new sanctions on Russia, Iran and China; and a provision that will force the Chinese company ByteDance to sell the popular social media service TikTok. In the House on Saturday, a majority of Republicans in the chamber voted against the foreign aid package. The bill also faced resistance among a handful of Senate Republicans who opposed any new aid to Ukraine. Fifteen voted with two Democrats - as well as independent Senator Bernie Sanders who objected to providing new offensive weapons to Israel - against the bill. ""Pouring more money into Ukraine's coffers will only prolong the conflict and lead to more loss of life,"" Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville said in remarks on Tuesday. ""No-one at the White House, the Pentagon, or the state department can articulate what victory looks like in this fight."" The aid package is expected to provide a significant boost to Ukraine's forces, which have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defence systems in recent months. On Tuesday, Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, faced the latest in a series of recent drone and missile strikes, with authorities saying two people in a residential neighbourhood were injured. The commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said he was expecting an attempt by Russian forces to advance on the city, which is near the Russian border. Between February 2022 and January 2024, the US gave Ukraine more than $40bn in military aid, according to German research organisation, the Kiel Institute. The foreign aid package passed on Tuesday also allocates $17bn to Israel, as well as $9bn for civilians suffering in conflict zones around the world, including Palestinians in Gaza. A further $8bn has been earmarked for allies in the Asia-Pacific, including Taiwan, to ""counter communist China"". Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reacted to the vote by thanking congressional leaders for their ""unwavering commitment to Israel's security"". ""Israel and the United States stand together in the fight against terrorism, defending democracy and our shared values,"" he said. The US already provides Israel with $3.8bn in military aid each year. Over in Asia, a Chinese government spokeswoman called the military aid for Taiwan a ""serious violation of the one-China principle"" that would ""send the wrong signal to the pro-independence separatist forces"" in Taiwan. ""We urge the US to take practical actions to fulfil its commitment not to support Taiwan independence by not arming Taiwan in any way,"" she said. Taiwan's incoming President William Lai said the aid package would ""strengthen deterrence against authoritarianism"". Taiwan is a self-governing island and considers itself distinct from China, but Beijing views it as a breakaway province and hopes to bring it back under its own control. The national security package also includes a provision that could lead to a nationwide ban on TikTok. The popular social media app's China-based parent company has nine months to sell its stake and find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down across the US. The statute gives the US president the option of extending the deadline by an additional 90 days, which means the latest the ban could take effect is nearly a year from now. The TikTok provision drew bipartisan support, with lawmakers arguing that the Chinese government could invoke security laws to compel ByteDance to hand over data about the app's estimated 170 million US users. TikTok has repeatedly said it has not provided, and would not provide, its foreign user data to the Chinese government. On Saturday, the House of Representatives held a separate vote on a border-security bill that included conservative priorities, but it did not garner the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome a procedural hurdle. In the Senate, several Republicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, voted against the Ukraine aid package because it did not include increased funding for US border security. Mr Cruz called it one of the toughest votes of his congressional career, but that the US needed to address the immigration issue first. ""I can't continue to allocate funds to secure Ukraine's border before we secure our own,"" Mr Cruz said. In February, a group of Democratic and Republican senators proposed a foreign aid package that included significant immigration policy reforms and additional funding. That effort collapsed, however, after former President Donald Trump and his congressional allies said the changes were not enough.",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68885868,politics
314,Russian deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov accused of taking bribes,"A Russian deputy defence minister has been accused of taking bribes and remanded in custody by a court in Moscow. Timur Ivanov, who denies the charges, is accused of accepting bribes ""on a particularly large scale"". Appointed to the defence ministry in 2016, Mr Ivanov, 47, has been responsible for Russia's military infrastructure projects. Activists have long criticised the levels of alleged corruption in Russia. However, such high profile cases have been rare since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Mr Ivanov is considered an ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and has worked with him for many years. He was previously deputy prime minister of the Moscow region, where Mr Shoigu briefly served as governor. The Kremlin has rejected reports in some Russian media that the real reason for Mr Ivanov's arrest was that he was suspected of treason. ""There are many different interpretations around all this now... You need to focus on official information,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He also stated that President Vladimir Putin had been notified of Mr Ivanov's detention in advance. In 2022, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), the group founded by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, accused Mr Ivanov of participating in ""corruption schemes during construction in the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia"". In particular, it said he had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, much of which was destroyed by Russian bombing in the months following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Basmanny district court in Moscow remanded him in jail for two months on charges of entering into a criminal conspiracy with third parties in his role of supervising the construction and overhaul of defence ministry facilities. If found guilty he could face up to 15 years in jail. A second man, Sergei Borodin, who was described as a friend of the Mr Ivanov, also appeared in court on Moscow on similar charges. Mr Ivanov denied the allegations made against him by Russia's Investigative Committee . The section of Russia's criminal code under which Mr Ivanov was detained - Part 6 of article 290 - applies when a suspected bribe exceeds one million roubles (£8,620; $10,700). Mr Ivanov's arrest marks a rare move against a member of Russia's governing elite, many of whom are believed to have used their positions to amass vast personal fortunes. Some Russian commentators have said the arrest will be a blow to Mr Shoigu. ""If he can't manage it, he will be next to fall. This person is 100% his man,"" one anonymous source told a popular military Telegram channel. Mr Ivanov has been sanctioned by the US and UK and is the subject of a travel ban and asset freeze imposed by the European Union , which describes him as being ""tenth in the overall hierarchy of the Russian military leadership"".",2024-04-24,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68886406,politics
315,Ukraine war: Kyiv tightens pressure on fighting age men abroad,"Ukraine is suspending consular services for male citizens aged 18 to 60 abroad as part of a drive to beef up numbers joining the military. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said protecting the rights of Ukrainians was still key but ""the main priority is to protect our homeland from destruction"" during Russia's full-scale invasion. Russia has a big advantage in numbers and weapons on the battlefield. Kyiv recently lowered the age of mobilisation from 27 to 25. After ""inviting"" Ukrainian men abroad to return home last December, it seems the government wants to apply more pressure, by denying them potentially vital services overseas. With the recent passing of the controversial new mobilisation law, Kyiv seems to be past the point of caring about unpopular decisions. Mr Kuleba wrote on social media that ""fair attitudes"" would be restored for Ukrainian men of military age both at home and abroad. He complained that at the moment it appeared that men of conscription age were leaving their country, then expecting to receive services from the state: ""It does not work this way. Our country is at war."" It is not yet clear who Ukraine's new consular restrictions will apply to, with many Ukrainian men abroad having legitimate exemptions from fighting such as being disabled or having three or more children. A letter signed by a senior foreign affairs official suggested documents would only be issued by consulates to Ukrainian men to enable them to return home. Separately, the state passport service said the issue of biometric passports outside Ukraine had been put on hold ""due to technical reasons"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a full-scale Russian offensive is expected in the coming weeks after Ukraine's loss of the city of Avdiivka during the winter. The military said its forces had been involved in 86 combat engagements on Monday alone. The US Senate is expected to approve a $60.8bn aid package for Ukraine on Tuesday, bringing to an end a six-month delay in financial support. However, Kyiv is in dire need of new manpower to defend a front line that stretches more than 1,000km (620 miles). Posters have appeared on the streets of Ukrainian cities portraying soldiers urging their compatriots to sign up to defend their country. But those who want to volunteer for the military did so long ago and are either dead, wounded or exhausted on the front lines. Instead of focusing on a rotation model, ministers are saying everyone should do their bit, for as long as it takes. However, the main criticism of Ukraine's new mobilisation law is the lack of a limit on time served, which some argue takes away what little incentive there was for men who did not want to fight anyway. A combination of this new law, hostile front lines and a recruitment system riddled with corruption claims has compelled men of fighting age to escape the country in their hundreds of thousands. The UN's refugee agency estimates that more than 6.4 million Ukrainians have fled their country, many of them to countries in the European Union. The EU's statistics agency estimates that 20.6% of the estimated 4.3 million Ukrainians currently living within its borders are men. Meanwhile, a survey by the Rating group in Ukraine suggested that 62% of Ukrainians were prepared to fight for their country at a time of war, while a third said they were not. It said that was the highest score among European nations.",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68880085,politics
316,Largest UK fire engine aid convoy heads to Ukraine,"A convoy of the largest number of fire and rescue vehicles to date is set to deliver emergency aid to Ukraine, says the Home Office. Twenty fire engines carrying more than 2,800 pieces of firefighting equipment such as ladders, boats and breathing kits are due to leave Kent on 30 April. More than 100 volunteers from 15 brigades from across England and Wales and from the organisation Fire Aid will travel to the war-torn country. Chris Philp, Home Office minister, said the ""barbaric invasion"" has ""taken a toll on the brave people of Ukraine’s"" fire services. Nearly 400 fire stations have been destroyed and 91 firefighters killed since the war began, according to the latest Home Office figures. It is hoped the donations - which include the vehicles - will provide a much-needed boost to the war-torn country's fire services. In total, 33 fire and rescue vehicles will form the convoy including two mechanics’ vehicles and one aerial ladder platform, which disperses water onto buildings from above. Road traffic collision equipment, fire and water PPE and safe working at height kits are among the other pieces of equipment being sent. The convoy is sponsored by the Home Office. Minister Mr Philp said: ""Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine has taken a toll on the brave people of Ukraine’s fire and rescue services. ""We are now in the third year of this senseless conflict and today’s donation shows our determination to support the people of Ukraine remains as strong as ever."" Mark Hardingham, chairman of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said: “We have witnessed the sheer strength and resilience of Ukrainian firefighters since the day the war began. “With the war continuing and the task before them increasingly challenging, the UK and international firefighter community will continue to provide support however we can. “The efforts to bring this equipment together, and get it to where it’s needed most, demonstrates the very best of UK fire and rescue services.” Follow BBC Kent on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

317,Rishi Sunak to pledge more money to support Ukraine,"The PM has arrived in Poland to meet Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and the secretary general of the Nato defence alliance - and promise more money to support Ukraine. The UK will provide an additional £500m to Kyiv on top of the £2.5bn allocated for this financial year. Rishi Sunak wants to emphasise the UK's role in defending Ukraine. Mr Sunak will then head to Berlin to meet the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday. Europe confronts an ""expansionist Russia"" and Ukraine faces a ""difficult summer"", Downing Street says. ""Defending Ukraine against Russia's brutal ambitions is vital for our security and for all of Europe. ""If Putin is allowed to succeed in this war of aggression, he will not stop at the Polish border,"" Mr Sunak said. Ukraine and Poland share a 300-mile border. Poland also has a 130-mile land frontier with Russia itself - with Kaliningrad, the chunk of Russia, its exclave on the Baltic Sea. The focus from Mr Sunak is the extra support for Ukraine and so he will argue for Europe as a whole: more ammunition, air defences, drones and engineering support. In what it is billing as it largest-ever single delivery of equipment, the UK is sending more than 1,600 strike and air defence missiles, and additional Storm Shadow long-range missiles. There will also be more than 400 vehicles, including 162 armoured vehicles, 60 boats, including offshore raiding craft, and nearly four million rounds of ammunition. The additional £500m in funding for this year would also be put towards drones made in the UK, Downing Street said. As well as meeting Mr Tusk, who used to be one of the European Union's most senior figures, and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the UK will offer to deploy an RAF squadron to carry out policing of Poland's skies for Nato next year. It is another reminder that alongside war in the Middle East, war continues in Europe too. And conversation about it will continue on Wednesday in Berlin, when Mr Sunak meets the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The US House of Representatives has finally approved billions of dollars in new US military aid for Ukraine. The much-delayed measure had vocal opponents in Congress and it took a bipartisan deal to get the $61bn (£49bn) package through. It will now go to the Senate, which is expected to pass it within the next few days before President Joe Biden signs it into law. And following a Nato-Ukraine summit last week, Mr Stoltenberg said Nato will give Ukraine more advanced air defences after urgent Kyiv pleas and deadly Russian attacks.",2024-04-23,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68878627,politics
318,Biden vows to 'quickly' supply new military aid to Ukraine,"Joe Biden has told Volodymyr Zelensky he will ""move quickly"" to send Ukraine fresh military aid, after US lawmakers passed a $61bn (£49bn) support package. The House of Representatives approved the bill on Saturday after months of political gridlock in the chamber. Mr Biden promised ""significant"" support for Kyiv - including more air defences - if senators approve the bill as expected on Tuesday. The assurances come as Russian attacks destroyed a TV tower in Kharkiv. Footage showed the red and white tower collapsing seconds after Russian missiles slammed into it on Monday afternoon in the eastern Ukrainian city, which lies just 19 miles (30km) from the Russian border. Local officials said there were no casualties in the attack, with regional Governor Oleg Syniehubov writing on social media that staff were in a shelter at the time. But Mr Syniehubov said the attack had disrupted television broadcasting in the region. Kharkiv has been targeted in relentless air attacks by Russian forces in recent weeks. In a social media post after the attack, President Zelensky wrote that it was ""Russia's clear intention to make the city uninhabitable"". He added that he had informed President Biden of the strike, which he said happened just before their call on Monday. In a readout of the call released by the White House, President Biden said his administration had a ""lasting commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom against Russian aggression"" . The White House also said Mr Biden had committed to helping Ukraine ""maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration"". The aid package approved by the House on Saturday includes more than $9bn (£7.28bn) of economic assistance in the form of ""forgivable loans"" - ones that do not need to be paid back. Mr Zelensky welcomed Mr Biden's comments, and a top aide to the Ukrainian leader - Mykhailo Podolyak - said the fresh US aid had given the war-weary nation a welcome boost. But Moscow has enjoyed significant momentum in the conflict in recent weeks, notching up a series of victories in the east of the country. And Mr Zelensky has warned that Russia will likely seek a major battlefield success ahead of Victory Day - a state holiday celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany - on 9 May. He suggested that Moscow could seek to seize Chasiv Yar, a small town in Donetsk region, ahead of the holiday. Chasiv Yar lies just west of Bakhmut, the ruined city captured by Russia last year after months of bloody fighting. Military commanders in Kyiv have said Chasiv Yar, which has been virtually emptied of its pre-war population, would open up a path towards the Ukrainian-held cities of Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk if captured by Moscow's forces. Russia's defence ministry also claimed it had seized the town of Novomykhailivka, also in Donetsk region, on Monday. The BBC cannot independently verify the claim, and Ukrainian defence officials said earlier that their forces had held back Russian advances on the village. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, told the BBC's Ukrainian service on Monday that Kyiv's forces faced ""a rather difficult situation"" in the coming weeks. Lt Gen Budanov conceded that the Russian seizure of the town of Avdiivka was ""a real success"" for them. But he said while the battlefield situation may worsen in the coming weeks for Ukraine, it would not be ""catastrophic"". ""Armageddon will not happen,"" he added. President Biden also spoke to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday. In a readout of the call released by her office, Ms von der Leyen said the pair discussed ""their steadfast support for Ukraine as it defends against Russian aggression"" and ""how sustained international support is vital to Ukraine's fight for freedom"". Meanwhile in Moscow, a Russian man has been sentenced to five years  of ""correctional labour"" for providing a comment critical of the invasion of Ukraine to a US publication. Yuri Kokhovets was accused of spreading ""fakes about the army"" for providing a quote critical of the war and of President Vladimir Putin to the US-funded Radio Free Europe in February 2022. It is the first known prosecution of a Russian citizen for expressing an opinion to a foreign journalist.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68874906,politics
319,Steve Rosenberg: Russia defiant over new US aid to Ukraine,"A good rule of thumb since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been that what is good for Kyiv is bad for Moscow. Last Saturday brought good news for the Ukrainian government. The US House of Representatives voted in favour of a $61bn (£49bn) aid package for Kyiv, which will be used to arm its military. The House also approved a bill that will allow the seizure and transfer to Ukraine of Russian assets frozen in America. The bills now move to the Senate for approval. Unsurprisingly, this did not go down well in Moscow. Hawkish former President Dmitry Medvedev condemned the ""61 billion bloody dollars"". He called for a new American Civil War that ""would finally lead to the inglorious break up of the 21st Century's evil empire, the United States of America"". On his flagship Sunday night state TV talk show, presenter Vladimir Solovyov described the idea of transferring Russian assets to Ukraine as ""an act of financial terrorism"". ""If they go through with this,"" Mr Solovyov said, ""then on the level of the State Duma and the government, we must declare America a financial terrorist."" He added that he now believes war between Russia and Nato is ""inevitable"". Talk of ""evil empires"" and ""inevitable wars"" is dramatic. But, in the main, Russia's reaction to events in Congress is best summed up by the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On. While fiercely critical of additional US aid to Kyiv, Russian officials and the state media have been playing down its potential consequences, with a series of key messages in the media. ""We had fully expected this,"" said Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday, when asked about the president's reaction to the US aid package. The same claim appeared in Monday's edition of the Russian government newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, which declared: ""Such an outcome of the vote on assistance to Ukraine had been expected"". Meanwhile, ""US aid won't change the situation on the battlefield"" is the headline in the latest edition of the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper. Mr Peskov delivered the same message almost word-for-word. ""It won't change the situation on the battlefield in any significant way,"" he told journalists. ""The Russian armed forces are improving their positions in the Special Military Operation [Russia's war in Ukraine]. ""The money being provided, the weapons which will be supplied for this money, they will not change the dynamic. More Ukrainians will be killed."" Russian officials and pro-Kremlin media claim that, by continuing to support Ukraine, the US is ""getting dragged into"" a war it will lose. Monday's Izvestia asked: ""Off the top of their heads, can anyone name one major conflict from which the Americans emerged undisputed victors? Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan?"" ""Sometimes it seems strange that Washington is constantly being dragged into military escapades which end in failure one after another,"" it continued. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova added: ""Washington is sinking deeper into this hybrid war against Russia. It will end in a loud and humiliating fiasco for America, like Vietnam and Afghanistan."" Moscow's messaging is clear: there is no panic. But there is concern. The aid package can help Ukraine and hurt Russia. Monday's edition of daily newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets predicts Ukrainian strikes in the near future, ""deep into [Russian] territory. But, most likely, on Crimea. And, of course, on the Crimean bridge"". That bridge, linking the Russian mainland to the annexed Crimean peninsula, is a key target for Ukraine and has been attacked before . There is concern, too, at the prospect of Russian assets abroad being handed over to Ukraine. The vast majority of frozen Russian funds are in the EU, not America. But Moscow will not want to see the US set a precedent that Europe could follow.",2024-04-22,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68874019,politics
320,Ukraine Russia war: US House passes crucial aid deal worth $61bn,"The House of Representatives has finally approved billions of dollars in new US military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion. The much-delayed measure had vocal opponents in Congress and it took a fragile bipartisan deal to get the $61bn (£49bn) package through. Republicans said more than a third would be dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the US support as ""vital"". The aid is likely to include air defence systems, mid to long-range missiles and artillery shells. It is unclear when it will arrive. The package will now go to the Senate, which is expected to pass it within the next few days before President Joe Biden signs it into law. Ukraine, which relies on Western weapons, desperately needs the aid as it struggles to contain invading Russian troops, who have been making steady advances in recent weeks. Mr Zelensky said the aid should come as quickly as possible. In an evening address on Sunday, he said that if Ukraine were given the right weapons it could change the situation on the frontline. ""Frontline air defence is as crucial as the protection of our cities and villages. Our long-range capabilities. Our artillery. Our ability to expand the area of our control,"" he said. ""Every day is important now."" Alongside replenishing weapons and ammunition systems, Ukraine will also receive more than $9bn (£7.28bn) of economic assistance in the form of ""forgivable loans"" - ones that do not need to be paid back. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since then tens of thousands of people, mainly soldiers, have been killed or injured on both sides, and millions of Ukrainians have had to flee their homes. Ukrainian soldiers are now running low on munitions and having to ration artillery shells on a front line more than 1,200km (745 miles) long. Last weekend, the head of Ukraine's military warned the battlefield situation in the east of the country had ""significantly worsened"" as Russia intensified its armoured assaults. Cheers and applause erupted in the House when the measure passed, by 311 votes to 112, with some Representatives waving Ukrainian flags. Welcoming the result, Mr Biden praised the bipartisan effort to ""answer history's call"" and urging the Senate to approve it quickly ""so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs"". The foreign aid package passed on Saturday also includes: Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the significant boost in aid would supplement the tens of billions of assistance being provided to Ukraine by European allies. ""Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia,"" EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel said in a joint statement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the package would ""make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians"". Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukraine's foreign affairs committee, described the vote as a ""historic decision"" that would ""definitely save lots of lives of our civilians and our soldiers"". ""It gives us strength, it gives us courage and resolve to continue to fight, and I'm sure that the situation at the front will soon change in our favour,"" he said. Both Mr Zelensky and head of the CIA William Burns have said that Ukraine will lose the war without American help. That has been reinforced over the past six months by Russia taking more territory, and other Western allies struggling to fill the gap left by Washington. Ukraine is now feeling the weight of American support once more. This is not the silver bullet which will help Ukraine win the war, but it extends its window to fight and keep the negotiating table at bay. The House vote had been delayed by Republicans for months, with some objecting to sending money overseas instead of dealing with the US-Mexico border issue. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he wanted to push the measures through, even if it jeopardised his position. On Saturday, it was passed by a comfortable margin - but those numbers obscure the increasingly sharp partisan divides on the issue. While all 210 Democrats voted in favour, more Republicans were against the legislation than in favour of it, 112 to 101. That could spell trouble for Mr Johnson. Three House Republicans are already calling for him to be ousted as Speaker. They may even force a vote on the matter next week. While the billions of dollars in new aid is expected to sustain the Ukrainian war effort in the months ahead, if Republicans gain more power in Congress - or take back the White House - further US support seems increasingly unlikely. Separately, the House also passed a bill that would force the China-based owner of the TikTok social media platform to either sell its stake or face a ban in the US.",2024-04-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68848277,politics
321,Ukraine aid package could help Kyiv slow Russia’s advance,"President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his gratitude to the US House of Representatives for approving a new $61bn (£49bn) package of military assistance for Ukraine after months of delays. He said the aid could save thousands of lives. While it's not uncommon for a country's future to be decided by politicians, a nation's very existence hinging on a vote 5,000 miles away is as extraordinary as it sounds. For Ukraine, the six-month wait for this military package has been as costly as it has been frustrating. Dwindling ammunition has cost it lives and territory . In this period of rare boosts for Kyiv, this was a biggie - the arrival of American weaponry will allow its beleaguered troops to do more than hang on. But it's no silver bullet. So, what is the package going to do? It is likely to include air defence systems, mid to long-range missiles and artillery shells. Ukraine's recent lack of them has led to Russian forces capturing hundreds more square kilometres of territory. When the aid arrives, Ukraine can potentially challenge Russia's air superiority, frustrate their supply lines and slow advancing troops. For Vitaliy, a serving soldier who we bump into in central Kyiv, it's important to focus on the positives. ""Every cent matters,"" he says. ""It is very much needed. We need everything. Every cartridge, every cent, every positive thought. We need all of it."" When I was in the Donetsk region last month , soldiers said most of the artillery rumbles were coming from the Russian side. Cities like Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk were bracing for what might be coming. This aid might save those cities. It won't give Ukraine the instant means to start liberating territory and force Russia back - but it gives a window for that to happen in the future. The consensus in Kyiv and Washington is that without this American help, Ukraine would lose. On a miserable Sunday morning, the warmth of the Kyiv metro will always beat the wet streets above. It's where we meet Maxym, who's pleased with the US aid finally being approved. ""I'm really happy about it,"" he says. ""I'm just a bit disappointed it took so long. Anyways, it's better late than never."" Maxym is frustrated by the growing debate over whether Ukraine should negotiate peace with Russia at the expense of territory. ""Russia doesn't want to negotiate,"" he explains. ""They don't want this middle ground that Europe and the US think will end this war. They want it all."" We also meet a woman, Vita, holding her son's hand and pulling him off a train. ""How else can Ukraine survive without it?"" she asks. ""It can't. We don't have such an army and weapons."" She then becomes emotional. ""It's impossible. We really want help, for our children to survive, so we wait."" She nods towards her son. The past six months have not only revealed Russia's dominance, but Europe's inability to provide the same level of support as the US. ""We need to think about the hypothetical eventuality the next package of US aid might not pass,"" says Mykola Bieleskov, a research fellow at the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies. ""That's why it's up for the UK and continental Europe to increase weapon production to meet Ukraine's requirements."" As for a realistic goal this year for Kyiv, Mykola hopes this American aid will help stabilise the front lines. Despite the return of western unity behind it, the issue for Ukraine has always been the time it takes for help to arrive. Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly doesn't have to negotiate as many political hurdles when it comes to military spending. Democratic delays aren't exclusive to allies overseas - Ukraine has its own issues with mobilising enough men for its war effort. A controversial conscription law has just been passed after months of debating and amendments. The challenge for President Zelensky now is keeping the politics separate to the fighting. He'll be under pressure to make this latest American offering count. Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Thanyarat Doksone",2024-04-21,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68868399,politics
322,US Speaker Mike Johnson may pay political price for Ukraine deal,"After months of delay and increasingly dire warnings, the US House of Representatives approved $61bn in new aid to Ukraine by a comfortable margin. The passage is a big win for Ukraine, which has been desperate for new military supplies to stave off a Russian offensive that is gaining ground. The US Pentagon press secretary told reports on Thursday that US military supplies, including for air defence systems and artillery units, could be moved to Ukraine in a matter of days after final approval. Saturday's rare moment of co-operation in Congress is also a cause for celebration for President Joe Biden, who has been calling the Ukraine war a world-defining conflict that the US cannot afford to shrug off. ""Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage,"" he said. The president could sign the aid into law later this week, as the US Senate is expected to approve the House foreign aid package - which also includes funding for Israel and Taiwan - as early as Tuesday. Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also has reason to be encouraged by the result. It was his change of heart on Ukraine support, from a reticence to active support, that proved the decisive factor in getting the foreign aid package approved. He received a vote of confidence from Donald Trump just a week ago, and the former president - who has spoken out against more support for Ukraine in the past - could have caused untold headaches for Mr Johnson as aid moved through the House. Instead, he largely stayed silent, focused instead on his ongoing trial in New York City. Mr Johnson may still pay a political price for Saturday's achievement, however. He relied heavily on Democratic support not just on the final votes but to clear procedural hurdles leading up to those votes. His decision to turn to Democrats was necessitated by intense resistance among a handful of Republicans, some in key positions of power in the House, who opposed any new aid to Ukraine. Now those Republicans may force a vote on whether to oust Mr Johnson from the speaker's chair. In remarks to the press after passage of the foreign aid bill, Mr Johnson defended his actions and said he was not walking around the halls of Congress worrying about being removed from power. ""I've done here what I believe to be the right thing,"" he said. While a move to trigger his ouster did not come on Saturday, three Republicans have come forward to call for Mr Johnson's removal - and they say more will join them in the coming days, as the House breaks for a week-long recess. ""I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents,"" Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who drafted a resolution to remove Mr Johnson weeks ago, said after the foreign aid package was approved. Public opinion polls have shown many Republican voters souring on additional aid to Ukraine, even as Democrats and independents support American help in the war effort. If a removal vote does come, some Democrats have expressed a willingness to back the speaker - essentially rewarding him for standing up to members of his own party to ensure Ukraine aid, a high priority for Democrats and the Biden White House, cleared the House. That could give Mr Johnson a short-term lease on political power, but it is difficult to imagine how a Republican speaker can reliably count on ongoing Democratic support. While there was overwhelming bipartisan backing for this foreign aid package, at some point Mr Johnson will push legislation on an issue that angers Democrats. If his Republican critics make another move then, he may find his former allies across the aisle are much less willing to throw him a lifeline. For now, however, Mr Johnson can savour a hard-fought victory. His strategy - to break the aid package into individual components on Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and to face down his Republican opponents who openly defied him - worked largely as planned. In his remarks after the votes, he said the legislation was not perfect, and that it was not a ""blank cheque"" - a reflection that recent months have shown there are clear and growing limits to US support. He said new aid must be monitored to ensure that it is being spent wisely and Ukraine must find an ""endgame strategy"" for the war. But he stood by the path he took to arrive at Saturday's result. ""I've said before, you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may,"" Mr Johnson said. For a legislator who languished in relatively obscurity until a leadership crisis last October pushed him into the spotlight, it is a historic achievement. But the coming weeks will determine whether it will also be his political epitaph.",2024-04-20,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68866912,politics
323,Ukraine war: Nato pledges more advanced air defences to Kyiv,"Nato will give Ukraine more advanced air defences after urgent Kyiv pleas and deadly Russian attacks, military bloc head Jens Stoltenberg has said. His comments come after a crisis Nato-Ukraine summit on Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv needed ""seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems"" to defend the country's cities. Seven people, including two children, were killed in Russian missile strikes on Friday, Ukrainian officials said. In other key developments on Friday: Speaking after the Nato-Ukraine Council summit held by video link, Mr Stoltenberg said: ""Nato defence ministers have agreed to step up and provide further military support, including more air defence."" He said the 32-member bloc ""has mapped out existing capabilities across the alliance and there are systems that can be made available to Ukraine"". ""So I expect new announcements on air defence capabilities for Ukraine soon,"" he added. The Nato chief said there were Patriot and other advanced air defence systems available in stocks of Nato countries that could be given to Ukraine - but he gave no details about what exactly Kyiv might get. Last week, Germany pledged to supply Kyiv with a third US-made Patriot battery out of its military stocks. Ukraine currently has several Patriot systems, but not enough to defend its cities from massive Russian attacks. Meanwhile, President Zelensky said after the summit: ""We need seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems, and it's a minimum number. They can save many lives and really change the situation. You [Nato] have such systems."" The Ukrainian leader laid out four other key priorities Kyiv has long been pressing for: Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is in its third year now, and there are no signs that Europe's biggest land war since World War Two might end any time soon. Moscow's troops have recently been making steady - albeit slow - advances in eastern Ukraine, as Kyiv faces critical arms shortages. Mr Zelensky recently admitted that Ukraine is outgunned and could lose the war without urgent Western military aid. Ukraine is critically dependent on advanced armoury supplies from its Western allies, particularly the US, to be able to continue fighting Russia - a far bigger military force with an abundance of artillery ammunition. Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian officials said seven people, including a boy and a girl, were killed and more than 30 injured in Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region. The northern city of Chernihiv was struck in Russia's deadliest attack for some time earlier this week, leaving 18 dead and dozens wounded. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Air Force said it had brought down a Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bomber 300km (186 miles) from Ukrainian territory. It said the plane eventually went down in Russia's Stavropol region after it had launched a missile strike on Ukraine. Ukraine's defence intelligence described the strike as a special operation similar to January's attack on a Russian A-50 spy plane . Intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told BBC Ukraine that ""we waited for a long time, prepared, and finally succeeded"". A source in Ukraine's intelligence later told the BBC the Russian bomber was shot down on Friday using a Soviet-era S-200 air defence system, which is believed to have been upgraded. Unverified footage showed a plane on fire spiralling out of control and falling to the ground. Russia's defence ministry blamed a technical malfunction after the bomber had carried out a ""combat task"". Two pilots had been found alive, a third crew member was killed and rescue services were looking for a fourth, Stavropol's regional governor said.",2024-04-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68857046,politics
324,Ukraine war: Children among seven dead in Russian strike on Dnipropetrovsk region,"Two Russian strikes in Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region have killed at least seven people, including two children, local officials say. The station in the main city Dnipro came under attack, and several homes were hit further east in Synelnykove. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack showed that all Ukrainian cities needed more advanced air defences. In a separate strike, Ukraine said that for the first time it had downed a strategic long-range bomber in Russia. Officials said a boy aged eight and a girl of 14 were among five people killed when private homes were targeted by Russian strikes on the town of Synelnykove. A six-year-old boy, who had earlier been reported killed, was in a critical condition and several other people were wounded, Dnipropetrovsk regional head Serhiy Lysak said. Another two people were killed in the regional capital, Dnipro, when the train station and a five-storey building were hit. More than 30 people were injured in Friday's attack in the region. Rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia said a woman who was on duty at the time was killed and seven other railway workers were hurt. Rescue services were continuing to search the rubble and warned that the number of victims would rise, the ministry added. A maternity hospital was also hit. President Zelensky said that Ukraine and its allies ""must defeat Russian terror"", urging Kyiv's partners to urgently provide more advanced air defence systems. He added that he visited Ukrainian troops close to the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region on Friday. Ukraine has for months warned that it is running low on weapons capable of bringing down Russian missiles and drones, and Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has spoken of an ""urgent, critical need"" for fresh military aid. Earlier this week, the northern city of Chernihiv was struck in Russia's deadliest attack for some time, leaving 18 dead and dozens wounded. Three Iskander cruise missiles hit residential buildings close to the centre of the city, the regional leader said. For months, a US military aid package worth $60.8bn (£49bn) has been blocked by Republican representatives in Congress. However, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has said he is determined to bring the matter to a vote, which could take place as early as Saturday. Meanwhile, the air force in Kyiv said it had brought down a Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bomber 300km (186 miles) from Ukrainian territory. It said the plane eventually went down in Russia's Stavropol region after it had launched a missile strike on Ukraine. Ukraine's defence intelligence described the strike as a special operation similar to an earlier attack on a Russian long-range radar plane. In January, Ukraine's military said it had brought down an A-50 spy plane and a control centre plane over the Sea of Azov. A source in Ukrainian intelligence later told the BBC the Russian bomber was shot down using a Soviet-era S-200 air defence system, which is believed to have been upgraded. Unverified video on Friday showed a plane on fire spiralling out of control to the ground and Stavropol regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov said only that the plane had crashed in a Russian field some distance north of the main city. Russia's defence ministry blamed a technical malfunction after the bomber had carried out a ""combat task"". Two pilots had been found alive, a third crew member was killed and rescue services were looking for a fourth, the governor said. Ukrainian air force chief Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk said Russia had fired six Kh-22 cruise missiles overnight and two of them had been destroyed for the first time. The Tu-22M3 is described as a supersonic bomber and the air force commander said the planes were used to carry Kh-22 missiles for attacks on Ukrainian cities.",2024-04-19,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68853490,politics
325,"After their PM halts Ukraine aid, Slovaks dig deep to help","A crowdfunding campaign in Slovakia to buy artillery shells for Ukraine has exceeded its target of €1m (£850,000), less than 48 hours after it was launched. The campaign is a response to the Slovak cabinet's refusal to join an initiative by the Czech government to buy up hundreds of thousands of shells for the Ukrainian armed forces. ""We have to drive Putin out of Ukraine. We have to defeat him,"" said Otto Simko, a Holocaust survivor and veteran of the 1944 Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis. Aged 99, he helped kickstart the campaign to challenge the government's policy. ""I lived through the Second World War. I fought in it. I can tell you there was no point negotiating with Hitler and there is no point negotiating with Putin,"" Simko told the BBC from Bratislava. It was a random conversation the Slovak veteran had with a journalist and a philosopher that led to the idea of crowdfunding Slovak help for Kyiv. In essence it allows Slovaks to bypass the populist-nationalist government of Robert Fico, who came to power in October pledging not to send ""one more round of ammunition"" to Ukraine. For months Ukrainian forces have struggled to defend their front lines from the Russian advance because of a shortage of shells, rockets and air defences. But Mr Fico has flatly refused to join about 20 countries that have signed up to the Czech operation to procure large quantities of artillery ammunition on the global arms market. The Slovak prime minister says the West's policy of arming Ukraine is only prolonging the conflict, and Kyiv should instead lay down its arms and sue for peace with Moscow. The crowdfunding campaign has provided an outlet for those Slovaks who do not agree with him. By Friday afternoon, more than 32,000 people had donated more than €2m since it launched on Tuesday afternoon. The money will go directly to the Czech government's initiative. ""We're really pleasantly surprised at the huge force it's awoken,"" said Zuzana Izsakova from the ""Peace to Ukraine"" initiative, which is running the effort in conjunction with the Czech-based Endowment Fund for Ukraine. ""It's a sign of the resistance of Slovak society against the government and the foreign policy of Robert Fico,"" she told the BBC. The campaign, running under the slogan ""If The Government Won't - We Will"", would continue even now it had met its target, she said. So far Mr Fico has not commented publicly on the campaign. However, Defence Minister Robert Kalinak told the Markiza TV station that Slovakia was a democracy and people were free to do what they wanted. His government was working instead on providing Kyiv with assistance such as demining equipment, he said. The Czech ammunition initiative sees Prague acting as a middleman, combining extensive defence contacts dating back to the Cold War with money from EU and Nato partners to procure ammunition for Ukraine's shell-starved artillery batteries. The scheme has been lauded by allies including President Joe Biden, at a time when Ukraine military aid has been mired for months in Congressional bickering and the EU's own ammunition pledges have fallen far short. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on a visit to Washington this week his country had so far signed contracts for 180,000 rounds and was securing the purchase of 300,000 more, following substantial pledges of money from Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and others. The first shells would arrive in June, said Mr Fiala. However, the project is shrouded in strategic ambiguity, and other Czech officials have suggested tens of thousands have already arrived on the battlefield. It is also unclear which countries are providing the shells, with unconfirmed claims that some of them enjoy friendly relations with Moscow. The Czech government says up to 1.5 million rounds could be available on the global market if the funds can be secured. Otto Simko said he had not hesitated to dip into his pension to help fund what he said was Ukraine's battle against totalitarianism. ""Remember [Neville] Chamberlain.

326,Man arrested in Poland over alleged Russia plot to kill Zelensky,"A Polish man has been arrested and charged with planning to co-operate with Russian intelligence services to aid a possible assassination of Volodymyr Zelensky, authorities said. Polish prosecutors said the man, named as Pawel K, was allegedly tasked with collecting information about an airport in Poland used by Ukraine's president. The arrest was made on the basis of Ukrainian intelligence, they added. Authorities did not specify whether the man actually passed any information on. He could face up to eight years in prison if found guilty. The suspect is in custody and the investigation is ongoing. In a statement, Polish prosecutors alleged Pawel K had offered his services to Russian military intelligence. He contacted Russians ""directly involved in the war in Ukraine,"" they added. They said Pawel K had been tasked with collecting information about security at Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport in south-east Poland. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport was a small regional airport. But it has since has become a key hub in the vast operation to supply Western military aid to Ukraine. Military and cargo aircraft from the US and across Europe regularly fly in and out of the airport to deliver supplies to waiting trucks that make the 100km (62 mile) journey to the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian airspace is closed to most flights, so leaders travelling in and out of the country tend to fly in to neighbouring countries such as Poland and travel on to Kyiv by train. Mr Zelensky is known to have flown out of Rzeszow-Jasionka on foreign visits. In December 2022, he flew back to the airport after a visit to Washington. Other foreign dignitaries, such as US President Joe Biden, have transited via the airport on their way to Ukraine. Last year, Polish authorities said they had arrested a group of foreign citizens on suspicion of spying for Russia. They were reported to have installed dozens of cameras, including some around Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport. On Thursday, neighbouring Germany arrested two alleged Russian spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine.",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68848317,politics
327,German spying: Two men held over suspected Russian sabotage plot,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said authorities had prevented ""possible explosive attacks"". The men are accused of scouting US military facilities and other sites. The main suspect, Dieter S, has been remanded in pre-trial detention accused of a string of offences, including plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also alleged to have fought for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine from 2014-16. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. The Russian ambassador has been summoned by the foreign ministry in Berlin. Ms Faeser condemned ""a particularly serious case of alleged spy activity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's criminal regime"". Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. According to the Spiegel website, a US Army facility at Grafenwöhr in Bavaria was spied on. Last year, the US sent dozens of Abrams battle tanks to Bavaria for Ukrainian soldiers to train on at Grafenwöhr and another base at Hohenfels before the tanks were sent to the front line in Ukraine. The case is reminiscent of series of arrests in Poland a year ago, when authorities said they had dismantled a Russian spy network which was preparing sabotage attacks aimed at paralysing supplies of military aid to Ukraine. German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann told German news agency DPA that the two arrests were ""another significant investigative success"" in the fight against Russian sabotage and spy networks. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"". The government in Berlin is spearheading a plan to help bolster Ukraine's air defences. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday that EU countries should try to help Ukraine with additional air defence systems, especially Patriot systems. Germany has already sent Ukraine two Patriot air defences and has promised a third. The two arrests in Bavaria follow several other high-profile espionage cases in Germany. Last summer a German national working for the military procurement agency was arrested in the western city of Koblenz on suspicion of handing information to Russian diplomats in Bonn and Berlin. In a separate scandal, the former boss of a collapsed German payment processing company, Wirecard, is believed to have fled to Moscow after the firm collapsed. Jan Marsalek is now suspected of being a Russian spy, who recruited officials in Austria to pass on sensitive information .",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,politics
328,Ukraine warns of WW3 ahead of long-stalled Congress aid vote,"Ukraine's prime minister has told the BBC there will be a ""Third World War"" if Ukraine loses its conflict with Russia, as he urged the US Congress to pass a long-stalled foreign aid bill. Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Russia says any fresh American aid for Ukraine will not make a difference on the battlefield, as the situation on the front line is looking ""unfavourable"" to Kyiv. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - with some 40% of the national budget due to be devoted to defence and security in 2024, and deals struck with Iran and North Korea covering ammunition, missiles and drones.",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68840261,politics
329,Lincolnshire IT firm's fresh appeal for laptops to send to Ukraine,"A Lincolnshire electronics firm wants people to donate their old laptops to keep families in Ukraine connected. Since the start of the conflict, Tattershall-based Sivill Service has sent more than 5,000 devices to the country. Manager Kelly Teasdale said the devices were providing a lifeline for displaced families. She told BBC Radio Lincolnshire: ""Those older devices are making a difference and saving lives."" Citing tensions in the Middle-East, Ms Teasdale said she felt people had ""forgotten"" about the plight of Ukrainians. She said: ""Things there are worse than ever."" Ms Teasdale said she could relate with being separated from family. ""I grew up as an RAF child and one of the big things we found with my dad being away was the communication was so difficult,"" she said.

330,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do."" In a later statement, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Iran's missile and drone programme as well as the IRGC and the Iranian defence ministry would also be covered.",2024-04-18,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,politics
331,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,politics
332,Ukraine war: Eighteen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 18 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to local officials. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoi in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. They initially said 17 people had died but regional chief said later that another person had died and 37 others were being treated in hospital. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",2024-04-17,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,politics
333,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2024-04-16,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,politics
334,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",2024-04-15,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,politics
335,Ukraine war: Russian double-tap strikes hit civilians then rescuers too,"On the night of 3 April, a swarm of Russian drones attacked Kharkiv, in Ukraine's northeast. The country's second-largest city has been targeted almost incessantly since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. But this time was worse than usual, because, when rescue workers arrived at the scene, there was a second strike. Three of them were killed. The following Friday, it happened again when Russian missiles hit Zaporizhzhia, a major city in Ukraine's southeast. Rescuers and journalists rushed to the scene, and then two more missiles hit. In total, four people were killed and more than 20 were wounded, including two local journalists. Both the Kharkiv and the Zaporizhzhia attacks employed a technique called ""double-tap"" - when an initial air strike is followed by a second attack, killing rescuers trying to help the injured. Russia has carried out this kind of repeat attack before. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a strike on a building in the southern city of Odesa in March that killed 20 was a double-tap, and called it a ""despicable act of cowardice"". But Ukrainian officials say they have seen an increase in the use of such attacks. Oleh Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, told Ukrainian media that Russia has started incorporating repeat strikes on its targets ""day and night"". ""The occupiers are using the tactic of double-taps to hit civilian rescuers and other workers who are there first to arrive at the scene,"" he said. On Thursday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it had seen a ""particularly troubling pattern"" of double taps in recent weeks. It called them ""cruel"" and ""unconscionable"" and urged for them to stop. Rescuers from Ukraine's State Emergencies Service DSNS often arrive to deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks before everyone else, and they also say the threat of repeat strikes is becoming ever more frequent. ""Unfortunately, the tactic of double-tapping has been used increasingly often recently. This is difficult to comprehend. The Russians have no right to do this,"" DSNS spokesman Oleksandr Khorunzhy told the BBC. ""They know perfectly well what they're doing, and not just to rescuers, police officers, utility workers or medics. This affects ordinary civilians,"" Mr Khorunzhy said. He called double-taps ""utterly immoral"". ""I can't wrap my head around this, it's just inhuman,"" he said. ""They see perfectly well that unarmed rescuers are the first to arrive at the sites of their attacks."" The DSNS says 91 of its rescuers have been killed and more than 340 injured since the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kira Oves was one of the journalists injured in the Zaporizhzhia double-tap attack. She told the BBC that she had just arrived at the scene of a strike when she heard a whistling sound. ""A colleague shouted: Incoming! On the ground!"" She crouched and heard a massive explosion. She only realised that she was wounded after she felt blood streaming down her face. She and her colleague ran to what they thought was a safe place - only to hear another ""enormous blast"". ""I knelt down, and a policewoman rushed over to me to help close the wound. Another police officer bandaged my head to stop the bleeding. From the shouting we found out that another journalist had been wounded much more badly,"" Kira said. She had not expected two more strikes to follow the one she had gone to report on. Ukrainians targeted by double-tap attacks accuse Russia of trying to crush their fighting spirit and resilience. They also worry that no medic or emergency worker would be prepared to risk coming to their rescue for fear of coming under fire, too. But there are other pragmatic reasons for Russia's strategy too. ""If you abandon any pretence at subscribing to international humanitarian law and even commonly accepted humanitarian norms, then there is a sound military rationale for double-tap attacks because you target high-profile targets,"" says Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think-tank. There is a limited supply of first responders such as medics, emergency personnel and fire crews and they are difficult to replace. ""If you take them out by the second attack on the same spot, at exactly the time when they've congregated to help the victims of the first attack, you're actually achieving quite a lot."" Karolina Hird, an analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War, says double-tap attacks targeting rescue workers could, and likely do, constitute a war crime. ""If, indeed, Russian forces are found to be targeting specifically and intentionally these sections of the population - that would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law and the general rules and norms of armed conflict,"" Ms Hird told the BBC. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross told the BBC that all parties involved in a conflict had an obligation to ""respect and protect"" both the wounded and those who cared for them. If one party chooses to re-attack the same target, international humanitarian law requires them to take ""particular care"" when first responders are trying to evacuate the wounded, the ICRC said. Russia adopted the same strategy previously in Syria, where its troops fought against anti-government rebels between 2015 and 2017. In that case it targeted rescuers from the White Helmets, a civil defence group. ""We have documented hundreds of such cases since Russia intervened in 2015,"" the White Helmets chief Raed al-Saleh says. ""Frankly, the Russian army has no morals when it comes to military operations. It focuses on breaking the will of civilians."" Russia has not explicitly disavowed double-taps, but it has repeatedly denied it aims for civilian targets. ""Our military does not hit social facilities and residential neighbourhoods and does not hit civilians,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in January. But those in towns and cities across Ukraine see the opposite is the case. ""They're using double-taps to kill as many of us as possible,"" says Kira Oves, the journalist wounded in one such attack in Zaporizhzhia. ""But they'll fail, because Ukrainians are survivors. We shall win.""",2024-04-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68761490,politics
336,Ukraine army chief says Russia making significant 'gains' in east of country,"The head of Ukraine's military has warned the battlefield situation in the east of the country has ""significantly worsened"" in recent days. Fierce battles are ongoing in a several villages in the eastern Donbas region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was benefitting from warm weather - making terrain more accessible to its tanks - and making tactical gains. It comes as Germany said it will give Ukraine an extra Patriot missile defence system to fend off air attacks. In his update posted to social media on Saturday, Gen Syrskyi explained the situation on the eastern front had deteriorated as Russia intensified its armoured assaults. Battles have raged for control of Bohdanivka - a village west of the devastated city of Bakhmut, he said. The settlement lies a few kilometres northeast of the town of Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the town of Avdiivka in February to the south. Ukrainian officials say a slowdown in military assistance from the West - especially the US - has left it more exposed to aerial attacks and heavily outgunned on the battlefield. Despite repeated assurances that he is dedicated to Ukraine's defence, US House Speaker Mike Johnson has failed to advance a new military aid bill. The Democratic-controlled Senate passed fresh funding in February which included $60bn in aid for Kyiv, but conservative Republicans in the House objected to the bill as it did not include funds for border security. Gen Syrskyi said without fresh aid and sophisticated weapons Kyiv would be unable ""to seize the strategic initiative"" from the numerically superior Russian forces. Separately on Saturday, Germany vowed to give Ukraine an additional air defence system. Ukraine has made increasingly desperate appeals for supplies of air defence missiles in recent weeks. On Friday, a major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Trypillya power plant was the largest electricity provider for three regions, including Kyiv, officials said. In response, Berlin has agreed to give Kyiv an additional Patriot missile system. It is capable of intercepting Russia's most advanced munitions, including Kinzal hypersonic missiles. Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russian strikes against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure were causing untold suffering. President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Germany for the decision, calling it ""a true manifestation of support for Ukraine"". Since President Vladimir Putin won his stage managed election last month, Moscow has stepped up air attacks on Ukraine. Russia has, in recent days, unleashed three massive aerial strikes on its energy system, pounding power plants and substations. Elsewhere, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it has foiled an assassination attempt on the governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin. Officials said two men attempted to strike Mr Prokudin's car with a Russian-manufactured drone. ""This was not the first attempt, and probably not the last one,"" Mr Prokudin said a message posted to Telegram. SBU officials also said they had detained 11 networks of Russian operatives since the start of 2024. SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk said in another Telegram post that this was in addition to 47 last year.",2024-04-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68806207,politics
337,Ukraine could face defeat in 2024. Here's how that might look,"The former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command has warned that Ukraine could face defeat by Russia in 2024. General Sir Richard Barrons has told the BBC there is ""a serious risk"" of Ukraine losing the war this year. The reason, he says, is ""because Ukraine may come to feel it can't win"". ""And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die any longer, just to defend the indefensible?"" Ukraine is not yet at that point. But its forces are running critically low on ammunition, troops and air defences. Its much-heralded counter-offensive last year failed to dislodge the Russians from ground they had seized and now Moscow is gearing up for a summer offensive. So what will that look like and what are its likely strategic objectives? ""The shape of the Russian offensive that's going to come is pretty clear,"" says Gen Barrons. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people reinforced by the use of newish weapons."" These include the FAB glide bomb, an adapted Soviet-era ""dumb bomb"" fitted with fins, GPS guidance and 1500kg of high explosive, that is wreaking havoc on Ukrainian defences. ""At some point this summer,"" says Gen Barrons, ""we expect to see a major Russian offensive, with the intent of doing more than smash forward with small gains to perhaps try and break through the Ukrainian lines. ""And if that happens we would run the risk of Russian forces breaking through and then exploiting into areas of Ukraine where the Ukrainian armed forces cannot stop them."" But where? Last year the Russians knew exactly where Ukraine was likely to attack - from the direction of Zaporizhzhia south towards the Sea of Azov. They planned accordingly and successfully blunted Ukraine's advance. Now the boot is on the other foot as Russia masses its troops and keeps Kyiv guessing where it is going to attack next. ""One of the challenges the Ukrainians have,"" says Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow in land warfare at the Whitehall thinktank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), ""is that the Russians can choose where they commit their forces. ""It's a very long front line and the Ukrainians need to be able to defend all of it."" Which, of course, they cannot. ""The Ukrainian military will lose ground,"" says Dr Watling. ""The question is: how much and which population centres are going to be affected?"" It is quite possible that Russia's General Staff have yet to go firm on which direction to designate as their main effort. But it is possible to broadly break down their various options into three broad locations. ""Kharkiv,"" says Dr Watling, ""is certainly vulnerable."" As Ukraine's second city, situated perilously close to the Russian border, Kharkiv is a tempting goal for Moscow. It is currently being pummelled daily with Russian missile strikes, with Ukraine unable to field sufficient air defences to ward off the lethal mix of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles aimed in its direction. ""I think the offensive this year will have breaking out of the Donbas as its first objective,"" adds Gen Barrons, ""and their eye will be on Kharkiv which is 29km [18 miles] or so from the Russian border, a major prize."" Could Ukraine still function as a viable entity if Kharkiv were to fall? Yes, say analysts, but it would be a catastrophic blow to both its morale and its economy. The area of eastern Ukraine known collectively as the Donbas has been at war since 2014, when Moscow-backed separatists declared themselves ""people's republics"". In 2022 Russia illegally annexed the two Donbas oblasts, or provinces, of Donetsk and Luhansk. This is where most of the fighting on land has been taking place over the past 18 months. Ukraine has, controversially, expended enormous efforts, in both manpower and resources, in trying to hold on to first the town of Bakhmut, and then Avdiivka. It has lost both, as well as some of its best fighting troops, in the attempt. Kyiv has countered that its resistance has inflicted disproportionately high casualties on the Russians. That is true, with the battlefield in these places being dubbed ""the meat grinder"". But Moscow has plenty more troops to throw into the fight - and Ukraine does not. The Commander of US Forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, has warned that unless the US rushes significantly more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine then its forces will be outgunned on the battlefield by ten to one. Mass matters. The Russian army's tactics, leadership and equipment may be inferior to Ukraine's, but it has such superiority in numbers, especially artillery, that if it does nothing else this year, its default option will be to keep pushing Ukraine's forces back in a westward direction, taking village after village. This, too, is a tempting prize for Moscow. The southern Ukrainian city of more than 700,000 (in peacetime) sits dangerously close to the Russian front lines. It is also something of a thorn in Russia's side given that it is the capital of an oblast of the same name that Russia has illegally annexed, and yet the city is still living freely in Ukrainian hands. But the formidable defences that Russia built south of Zaporizhzhia last year, in the correct expectation of a Ukrainian attack, would now complicate a Russian advance from there. The so-called Surovikin Line, consisting of triple layers of defences, is laced with the largest, most densely packed minefield in the world. Russia could partially dismantle this but its preparations would probably be detected. Russia's strategic objective this year may not even be territorial. It could simply be to crush Ukraine's fighting spirit and convince its Western backers that this war is a lost cause. Dr Jack Watling believes the Russian objective is ""to try to generate a sense of hopelessness"". ""This [Russian] offensive will not decisively end the conflict, irrespective of how it goes for either side,"" he says. Gen Barrons is also sceptical that, despite the dire situation Ukraine now finds itself in, Russia will automatically drive home its advantage with a decisive advance. ""I think the most likely outcome is that Russia will have made gains, but will not have managed to break through. ""It will not have forces that are big enough or good enough to punch all the way through to the river [Dnipro]... but the war will have turned in Russia's favour."" One thing is certain: Russia's President Vladimir Putin has no intention of giving up on his assault on Ukraine. He is like a poker player gambling all his chips on a win. He is counting on the West failing to supply Ukraine with the sufficient means to defend itself. Despite all the Nato summits, all the conferences and all the stirring speeches, there is a chance he may be right.",2024-04-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68778338,politics
338,Ukraine Russia war: BBC Russian journalist Ilya Barabanov branded 'foreign agent',"The Russian justice ministry has labelled two prominent journalists - BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Barabanov and science reporter Asya Kazantseva - as ""foreign agents"". Barabanov has written extensively about Russia's war in Ukraine and the Wagner mercenary group. The BBC condemned the ministry's move against him. ""The BBC strongly rejects the decision,"" a BBC statement said. The ""foreign agent"" label has very negative connotations in Russia. The government has used it to marginalise not only critics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but also voices challenging other Kremlin policies, including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups. One of Russia's most popular novelists - Boris Akunin - was put on the list in January. He is a long-standing critic of President Vladimir Putin. The term ""foreign agent"" recalls the Soviet-era campaign against ""enemies of the people"". ""Foreign agents"" have to identify themselves as such on social media and in other publications, and face burdensome financial reporting requirements. Both Barabanov and Kazantseva are now living abroad. Kazantseva signed an open letter from Russian scientists and science journalists demanding that Russian troops withdraw from Ukraine. She left Russia in January, saying she was being harassed by pro-war figures and seeing her lectures and book presentations cancelled. The justice ministry accused Barabanov - now based in Latvia - of ""spreading false information"" about Russian government decisions and policies, and of opposing the war in Ukraine. The BBC statement condemned the move, stressing that ""the BBC has a global reputation as a trusted and independent source of news"". It went on: ""BBC News Russian has been a vital source of accurate and impartial news to Russian-speakers for 80 years. We are incredibly proud of all our journalists and our priority right now is to support Ilya and all his colleagues to ensure that all are able to continue their jobs reporting on Russia at such an important time.""",2024-04-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68803936,politics
339,DragonFire: UK laser could be used against Russian drones on Ukraine front line,"A UK high-power laser weapon could be sent to Ukraine to take down Russian drones, the defence secretary says. According to Grant Shapps, the weapon could have ""huge ramifications"" for the conflict in Europe. The DragonFire weapon is expected to be rolled out by 2027, but Mr Shapps said he wanted to ""speed up"" production and make it available sooner. It follows a successful trial of the laser, carried out against an aerial target for the first time in January. The laser was originally expected to be operational by 2032, but new reforms intended to speed up government procurement of weapons mean that it will now be ready five years earlier. Despite this, the defence secretary told reporters while on a visit to Porton Down military research centre near Salisbury that he wanted to speed this up even further. ""Let's say that it didn't have to be 100% perfect in order for Ukrainians perhaps to get their hands on it,"" he said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says the faster timetable comes in response to the ""rapidly changing threat environment"" faced by the UK. ""It's designed to not wait until we have this at 99.9% perfection before it goes into the field, but get it to sort of 70% and then get it out there and then develop it from there,"" Mr Shapps said. ""But 2027 is still the date as of this moment,"" he continued. The weapon is precise enough to hit a £1 coin from a kilometre away, according to the MoD. It is hoped that it will pave the way for a low-cost alternative to missiles, to shoot down targets such as drones. January's successful test of the weapon was carried out at the MoD's Hebrides Range in Scotland and was hailed as a ""major step"" in bringing laser-directed energy weapons (LDEWs) into service. The greatest advantage of lasers is cost and, in theory, an ""unlimited magazine"" of ammunition - as long as there is a reliable source of power. But the big drawback is that they can only fire at targets in the line of sight, unlike most missiles. The US has been testing directed-energy weapons for decades. They have been fitted on to several warships for trials and evaluation. The UK's ambition to do the same by 2027 might be possible, but lasers have not been tried and tested in battle. US warships are still shooting down Houthi drones in the Red Sea with conventional missiles. Any suggestion that UK lasers could be sent to Ukraine to take out Russian drones is optimistic. Ukraine's demands are more urgent. It requires mobile air defence systems which have been proven in battle. With its electrical grid constantly being targeted by Russia, lasers which require a source of power, are unlikely to be the solution to Ukraine's urgent needs. LDEWs use an intense light beam to cut through their target and can strike at the speed of light. As a line-of-sight weapon, it can attack any visible target that is close enough, although the range of the DragonFire system is classified. Missiles can be far more expensive than the drones they destroy, with some costing millions of pounds compared with a few thousand. The MoD says firing the DragonFire system for 10 seconds is the cost equivalent of using a regular heater for an hour, with the operating expense typically less than £10 a shot.",2024-04-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68795603,politics
340,Ukraine war: Key power plant near Kyiv destroyed by Russian strikes,"A major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes early on Thursday, energy company Centrenergo said. Trypillya power plant was the largest electricity provider for three regions, including Kyiv, officials said. ""The scale of destruction is terrifying,"" said Centrenergo chairman Andriy Hota. Russia has long been deliberately and systematically targeting Ukraine's energy system. Mr Hota told the BBC that Thursday morning's strikes destroyed ""the transformer, the turbines, the generators. They destroyed 100%"". A fire broke out in the turbine workshop of the Trypillya plant - located 50km (31 miles) to the south of Kyiv - following Thursday's large-scale airborne attack. The Centrenergo boss said the plant was targeted by multiple missiles. Staff on shift were able to escape, he said, because they ran for cover as soon as the first drone hit. Residents were urged to shut their windows, charge all their devices and stock up on water. More than 80 missiles and drones targeted sites across Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday. Many targeted energy infrastructure and almost a third made it through Ukraine's air defences. Hours later, Centrenergo confirmed its Trypillya plant had been put out of use. Mr Hota said his company's entire generative capacity in Ukraine was now destroyed. It was one of Ukraine's largest providers of electricity and heat. It operated two other power plants - one in the Kharkiv region which was destroyed in late March, and one in an area of the Donetsk region that was taken over by Russia in 2022. The Kharkiv and the Trypillya plants used to generate some 8% of the country's electricity, according to Mr Hota. The Trypillya thermal plant provided power to the three central regions of Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Kyiv. The destruction of the Trypillya plant would not be a critical issue for Ukraine in the summer, he believed, although by winter it would become a ""giant problem"". While the plant can be rebuilt with help from spare parts from Europe, he says it will remain vulnerable to attack without Ukraine's allies providing powerful air defences. ""We can repair. We can do the impossible. But we need protection."" At least two more thermal power plants suffered ""significant damage"" overnight in the west of Ukraine, placing even more strain on electricity supply nationwide. The DTEK power company was already down to 20% capacity after repeat attacks in March. The company told the BBC that the latest missile and drone strike on these ""purely civilian power stations"" would make the task of providing critical power to the grid harder. ""Attack by attack, Russia is trying to strangle Ukraine's energy system and with it our hard-won freedom,"" DTEK said. The Kharkiv region in the north-east has been hard hit again after its power plants suffered major damage in late March. The mayor there described the situation as ""very difficult"" and announced more blackouts for households and businesses. For a time on Thursday, the Kharkiv metro stopped running to save power. It has since resumed, but the power supply is dipping and surging so the trains are only working very intermittently. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had been ""obliged to respond"" to the strikes on Ukrainian energy sites following Kyiv's attacks on Russian targets, although this is a war he launched without cause two years ago. ""Unfortunately, we observed a series of strikes on our energy sites recently and were obliged to respond,"" he said. ""I want to emphasise that, even for humanitarian reasons, we did not carry out any strikes in winter. What I mean is that we didn't want to leave social institutions without power - hospitals and the like. But after a series of attacks on our power facilities, we had to respond."" ""Strikes on energy"", he added, were part of Russia's aim of ""demilitarising"" Ukraine - one of his stated goals when the invasion began in February 2022. In a separate development, four people died and several more were injured in the southern city of Mykolaiv in a rare series of daytime strikes on Thursday. The Ukrainian Southern Military Command said on Telegram that private houses, cars and industrial facilities were damaged in the ""insidious"" attack.",2024-04-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68788110,politics
341,Ukraine war: MPs pass long-awaited law to boost troop numbers,"Ukraine's parliament has passed legislation to help mobilise troops to fight invading Russian forces. The measure - adopted after months of wrangling - is aimed at boosting numbers in the military, which is under severe pressure as Russia continues its advances in the east. But a clause aimed at demobilising soldiers after three years was dropped at the army's request. The president still has to sign the bill into law. Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelensky approved other measures, including lowering the age of mobilisation by two years, to 25. The new legislation passed on Thursday tightens registration processes and strengthens penalties for draft dodgers. MP Oleksandr Fedienko said, quoted by Reuters, that the bill would send a ""message to our partners that we are ready to retake our territory and we need weapons"". Ukraine's military has been under severe pressure of late, in part due to Russia's greater manpower. A senior general told MPs before the passing of the bill that Ukrainian forces were outnumbered by Russia by between seven and 10 to one. ""We are maintaining our defences with our last strength,"" joint forces commander Gen Yuriy Sodol said, quoted by Reuters. ""Pass this law and the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not let down you or the Ukrainian people."" A total of 283 MPs voted in favour of the bill, but 49 opposition lawmakers abstained. One of them, Oleksiy Goncharenko, said he could not vote for a bill that excluded demobilisation. ""The main question for those serving and those who might be potentially mobilised [is] 'how long will I serve?' Without this, I don't think the law will improve mobilisation,"" he said, quoted by the Financial Times. Protesters outside the parliament, many of whom have serving relatives, also criticised the exclusion. ""Our boys and girls in the service are very tired. They have been fighting for two years, and no-one is planning to replace them,"" Keteryna Kulibaba told Reuters. ""For rotation to happen, newcomers have to know how much time they'll have to spend [at the frontline]. ""Undefined mobilisation terms mean fighting forever. Without strictly defined terms, no-one will join the army."" The demobilisation issue will now be considered in a separate bill, parliament officials said. Draconian measures to prevent draft-dodging were also excluded from the latest version of the bill after a public outcry. The main provisions of the bill, which has not yet been published in full, include: The bill was passed hours after the country was hit by more heavy bombardments by Russia. More than 80 missiles and drones targeted sites across Ukraine, many of them involving energy infrastructure. The Trypillya power plant, a key provider of electricity for three regions including Kyiv, was completely destroyed . Ukraine has been asking Western countries to send more assistance, including ammunition and air defences.

A girl aged 10 was among four killed in Odesa late on Wednesday, in an attack coinciding with the city's liberation from the Nazis during World War Two. Two women and a girl of 14 were also killed in an attack on a pharmacy not far from Ukraine's northern border with Russia, officials said. Russia's recent attacks have targeted Ukraine's energy sector in particular. Power infrastructure came under attack in five regions early on Thursday from more than 40 missiles and 40 drones, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Some 200,000 people were left without power in the Kharkiv region alone, said officials, and Mr Zelensky appealed for increased international support. ""We need air defence and other defence assistance, not turning a blind eye and lengthy discussions,"" he said. A multi-billion dollar aid package for Kyiv continues to be blocked by Republicans in the US Congress. The head of the Ukrainian air force said 57 of 82 Russian airborne weapons were destroyed, although air defences failed to intercept either Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles fired by Russian MiG warplanes or guided S-300 missiles. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians with double-tap tactics, where a missile strike is followed by a second which aims to kill emergency service personnel arriving at the scene. Governor Kiper said ballistic missiles had been used in the strikes on Odesa between 18:00 and 18:30 (15:00-15:30 GMT) on Wednesday. Attacks on Kharkiv, the closest big city to the Russian border, have been intensifying in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials have said the city might be the target of a future Russian offensive. The country's second-largest city has suffered extensive damage from months of Russian bombardment since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine has been suffering setbacks on the ground in the past few months. Ukrainian troops have been running out of ammunition as vital US support has been held up by supporters of former President Donald Trump in Congress. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has been refusing to call a vote on a bill that would provide $60bn (£48bn) in military aid for Ukraine. The US's top general in Europe told Congress on Wednesday that Ukraine would run out of artillery shells and air defence interceptors ""in fairly short order"" without American support. Gen Christopher Cavoli said Russia was currently firing five artillery shells for every one fired by Ukrainian forces - a disparity which could soon increase to 10 to one. ""Without our support, they will not be able to prevail,"" Gen Cavoli said.",2024-04-11,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68781339,politics
343,Ukraine war: The Indian men traumatised by fighting for Russia,"In October last year, David Moothappan saw a Facebook advertisement offering jobs as security guards in Russia. The promised monthly salary - 204,000 roubles ($2,201; £1,739) - seemed a huge amount to the school-dropout fisherman from the southern Indian state of Kerala. Weeks later, Mr Moothappan, 23, found himself on the warfront in the Russian-held city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. ""It's death and destruction everywhere,"" he says, when asked about his time there. He and another man from Kerala managed to return home last week. They are among several Indians who were duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces in the country's war with Ukraine over the past few months. A few have managed to make their way back home but others are still stuck in Russia. Most of them are from poor families and were lured with the promise of jobs, sometimes as ""helpers"" in the Russian army. At least two Indians have died so far in the war. India's foreign ministry has said it is ""pressing very hard with the Russian authorities"" to bring back its citizens who have been tricked into fighting in the war. Last week, foreign minister S Jaishankar called this ""a matter of very, very deep concern"" for India. The BBC has emailed the Russian embassy in India for comment. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing. Mr Moothappan is relieved to be back home in the fishing village of Pozhiyoor in Kerala, but says he can't forget what he saw in the war. ""There were body parts strewn all over the ground,"" he says. Distraught, he started vomiting and almost fainted. ""Soon, the Russian officer commanding us told me to return to the camp. It took hours for me to recover,"" he says. He says he broke his leg around Christmas while fighting in a ""remote place"" - his family, he says, didn't know about his situation at that time. Mr Moothappan spent two and a half months in different hospitals in Luhansk, Volgograd and Rostov before recovering partially. In March, a group of Indians helped him reach the country's embassy in Moscow, which then arranged for him to travel back home. Some 61km away in Anchuthengu, another fishing hamlet in Kerala, Prince Sebastian has a similar story of escape - and trauma - to tell. Duped by a local agent, he was deployed in a group of 30 fighters in the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian town of Lysychansk. After just three weeks of training, he says he was sent to the frontline with several weapons including an RPG-30 (a handheld, disposable rocket-propelled grenade launcher) and bombs, which prevented him from moving quickly. Fifteen minutes after he reached the front, he says a bullet fired from close range deflected off the tank he was in and pierced below his left ear. He fell - on to what he realised was a dead Russian soldier. ""I was shocked and I couldn't move. After an hour, as the night fell, another bomb exploded. It badly injured my left leg."" He spent the night in a trench, bleeding. He escaped the next morning and subsequently spent weeks in different hospitals. He then got a month's leave to rest. During this time, a priest helped him contact the Indian embassy which then issued him a temporary passport and arranged for his return home. He says two of his friends who went with him, also fishermen, are still missing. Neither he nor their families have heard from them in weeks. Officials in Kerala say they have so far received complaints from the families of four men - Mr Moothappan, Mr Sebastian and his two friends - about being duped by agents. Mr Sebastian says he and his friends went to a local agent in their village to check if they could find jobs somewhere in Europe (the man is currently absconding). The agent suggested Russia, speaking of a ""golden opportunity"" to work as a security guard for a monthly salary of 200,000 rupees ($2,402; £1,898). They agreed instantly. The friends paid 700,000 rupees each to him for a Russian visa. On 4 January, they reached Moscow, where an Indian agent identified as Alex, who spoke their language, Malayalam, welcomed them. They spent the night in a flat, following which a man took them to a military officer in the city of Kostroma, 336km (208 miles) away, where they were made to sign a contract in Russian, a language they couldn't read, Mr Sebastian said. Three Sri Lankan recruits also joined them there. Then the six men were taken to a military camp in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine. The officers took their passports and mobile phones. The training started on 10 January. In the following days, they learnt how to use handheld anti-tank grenades and what to do if they were injured. After this, they were taken to a secondary base known as the Alabino Polygon. There, the training continued for 10 days, ""day and night"". ""All kinds of armaments were waiting for us there,"" Mr Sebastian said. ""I started enjoying the weapons like toys."" But the brutal reality of the war hit him on the battlefield. Now, he is hoping to resume fishing. ""I have to repay the money I borrowed from lenders and restart my life,"" he says. In Pozhiyoor, Mr Moothappan hopes to do the same. ""I was engaged to a girl in my village when I left. I told her I'll return with money and build a house before our marriage,"" he said. Now the couple have decided to wait for two more years as Mr Moothappan tries to rebuild his life. But he's happy that at least he didn't kill anyone in his time on the battlefield. ""One time, the Ukrainians were some 200m away. We were asked to go on the offensive but I didn't fire a single shot at them,"" he said. ""I can't kill anybody.""",2024-04-11,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68767470,politics
344,Why is Russia trying to frame Ukraine for concert massacre?,"It began with hints. Intimation. Now, it's no holds barred accusations. The Russian authorities are aggressively pushing the line that Ukraine and the West were behind last month's Crocus City concert hall massacre outside Moscow which left 145 people dead. The Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. But soon after the suspected gunmen were detained President Vladimir Putin hinted at a Ukrainian connection. At the weekend Russian state TV broadcast interrogation videos of the four suspects, all citizens of Tajikistan. One of the men said on camera that the post-attack plan had been ""to head towards Kyiv"". Their words must be taken with extreme caution. During a court appearance after their arrest the men showed signs of torture. The Russian TV correspondent presenting the report went on to make a series of strange claims: ""Following the terrorist attack Western sources and many Russian 'foreign agents' began to shift the focus from the Ukrainian connection to, exclusively, Islamic State."" In Russia many Kremlin critics have been designated ""foreign agents"" for allegedly receiving funding from abroad or just being deemed ""under foreign influence"". The ""shift of focus"" to the IS was hardly surprising. Not only had the group announced that it was behind the attack, it had released video of the shooting. By contrast, Ukraine had denied any involvement. What's more, both America and, reportedly, Iran had warned Moscow of possible attacks on Russian soil. In its 13-minute report, Russian state TV made no mention of the IS claim of responsibility. Then, from the journalist, this baseless accusation - that Western media ""had more sympathy for those who carried out the terrorist attack which killed more than 140 defenceless people, than for the victims…"" It was a clear attempt to demonise the West in the eyes of the Russian public. It's not just Russian TV saying this. So is the Russian foreign ministry. In a statement on its Telegram channel, the ministry claimed that in the West ""there is a strict order not to report in the media the true scale of the tragedy - not to mention the number of victims of the terrorist attack, the dead children… ""Demonstrations of humanity and sympathy for the Russian people are not allowed."" This is pure parallel reality. The BBC has received no such order. International media organisations widely reported the devastating consequences of the mass shooting and fire at Crocus City. As for sympathy, many Western diplomats visited the Russian foreign ministry to sign a book of condolence and, later, laid flowers for the victims outside Crocus City. That hasn't stopped Russian officials from lining up to blame Ukraine and the West. Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB security service, told Russian TV: ""We believe that the action was prepared by both the Islamist radicals themselves and was facilitated by Western special services. The special services of Ukraine are directly related to this."" Last week President Putin claimed that ""Russia cannot be the target of terrorist attacks by Islamic fundamentalists. We are a country that demonstrates a unique example of interfaith harmony and inter-religious and inter-ethnic unity"". Yet only last month the FSB reported it had thwarted an IS plot to attack a Moscow synagogue. So why is the Russian leadership seemingly determined to frame Ukraine and the West for the huge loss of life at Crocus City? Here are some possible reasons: Since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Russians have been led to believe that their principal adversaries are Ukraine and the ""collective West"". It's a message the authorities here are unwilling to alter. After all, if the Russian public were to conclude that radical Islam is a greater threat to their security than the Ukrainian government or Western leaders, they may wonder why Moscow hasn't focused on that particular threat and has chosen, instead, to fight Ukraine. Last month President Putin publicly dismissed a US embassy warning that an attack by extremists here was ""imminent"". He called the terror alert ""outright blackmail…[with] the intention of intimidating and destabilising our society"". The Crocus City concert hall attack followed days later. US officials subsequently made it clear that the intelligence they had shared with the Russian authorities had been ""specific, timely, and credible"". Blaming Kyiv and the West may be an attempt to distract attention from the question of what information was passed on and how the Russian authorities acted upon it. Asserting that Kyiv and the West were connected to the attack gives Moscow a pretext for any future escalation in the war in Ukraine - if it decides it needs it. But some commentators are warning the Russian authorities that, for a political system, identifying the wrong enemy can prove a fatal mistake. ""That's the way this type of system usually dies,"" believes political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov, honorary senior research associate at University College London. ""They concentrate on someone they see as the main enemy and miss the real one somewhere else. For now [the authorities] will concentrate on Ukraine, on the West, on liberals. And they will open the back door. It's through the back door that the real danger will come.""",2024-04-08,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68759150,politics
345,Ukraine war: UN body urges restraint after Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant hit,"A new drone attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant has raised the risk of a ""major nuclear accident"", the UN's atomic watchdog has warned. Russia said Ukraine was behind the attack, which it said injured three people. Ukraine has denied involvement. The giant Russian-held nuclear plant, with six reactors, is on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned against such attacks. IAEA head Rafael Grossi said Sunday's drone strike was ""reckless"" and ""a major escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers"" facing the plant. The Zaporizhzhia plant, in southern Ukraine, is the largest in Europe. Russian forces seized it shortly after launching their February 2022 full-scale invasion and have occupied it ever since, alongside most of the Zaporizhzhia region. The facility stopped generating power in 2022, but needs a constant supply of electricity to cool one of its reactors which is in a state of ""hot conservation"", meaning it is not fully offline. The IAEA, which has a team of experts at Zaporizhzhia, confirmed ""physical impact of drone attacks"" at the plant, including at one of the reactors. The plant's Russian-installed administration said radiation levels were normal and that there was no serious damage. The IAEA said the damage had not compromised nuclear safety, but it warned that ""this is a serious incident with potential to undermine [the] integrity of the reactor's containment system"". Mr Grossi specified there had been ""at least three direct hits"" against the plant's ""main reactor containment structures"". ""This cannot happen,"" he said. ""No one can conceivably benefit or get any military or political advantage from attacks against nuclear facilities. This is a no go."" Both Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse each other of shelling the plant and risking a serious nuclear accident. The plant's Russian administration has said Ukraine's armed forces were behind the attack, but Ukraine has denied the allegation. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the attacks were a ""very dangerous provocation"". Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate spokesman Andriy Yusov told the Ukrainska Pravda news website that ""Ukraine was not involved in any armed provocations on the site."" The plant is ""illegally occupied by Russia,"" he added. Mr Yusov accused Russia of endangering the nuclear facility, the civilian population and the environment by carrying out strikes on the plant itself. Last month the IAEA said its team of experts at the plant had heard explosions every day for a week. At the time, Mr Grossi said: ""For more than two years now, nuclear safety and security in Ukraine has been in constant jeopardy. We remain determined to do everything we can to help minimise the risk of a nuclear accident that could harm people and the environment, not only in Ukraine."" The region of Zaporizhzhia came under fire early on Monday morning.  Governor Ivan Federov said three people were killed and three more were wounded after Russian forces struck eight populated areas over 350 times in the space of 24 hours. Last week, a Russian strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed four people and wounded more than 20.",2024-04-08,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68757082,politics
346,More than 250 wheelchairs sent to Ukraine's injured,"A charity has sent more than 250 wheelchairs to disabled and injured people in Ukraine in two years. Hereford Help for Ukraine was set up in 2022 and had since teamed up with volunteers and companies across Herefordshire to gather money and much-needed aid. As well as wheelchairs, the group also sent packages of clothes, toiletries and food to the war-torn country. Volunteers also provided support to refugees living in the county since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Olga Tverdokhlib is an accountant but in her spare time she runs the organisation and is chair of the Ukraine Association in Hereford. “It’s very important for the Ukrainian people. So many people have been injured, many have lost their legs and can’t find funds for wheelchairs,"" she said. Disability equipment firm TPG Disableaids, based in the city, contacted the charity to offer spare equipment they could no longer use, the group said. “We are very thankful for the help because they can be very expensive,” Ms Tverdokhlib said. Initially volunteers would drive the aid and wheelchairs to Poland where they would be met by Ukrainian volunteers who took them the rest of the way. Now the charity said it paid £3,000 for the hauls to be loaded into Ukrainian lorries that come to Hereford to drop off trade deliveries.

347,Ukraine war: Bucha's wounds still raw two years on,"In March 2022 invading Russian troops occupied the Ukrainian town of Bucha outside Kyiv, leaving a trail of death and destruction which shocked the world. Two years after their departure, the BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford has gone back to see how its traumatised residents are trying to return to normal life. When Russian soldiers killed Ludmila's husband, she had to wrap him in a blanket and bury him at the back of their garden. She then fled Bucha with her daughter. It was March 2022. The Russians had occupied the small town just outside Kyiv and taken over the pensioners' home. Soldiers drove a tank into their yard and used the house opposite as their headquarters. Two years on, Ludmila has finally installed a marble headstone on Valeriy's grave with his photograph. After Bucha was liberated, she was able to have him reburied properly at the local cemetery. The couple's home, destroyed in the fighting, is slowly being rebuilt. Ludmila has been planting bright coloured flowers in the yard. But when the house is finished, she will live there alone. The building work is part of efforts to restore Bucha from the ruins left by retreating Russian soldiers. When Ukrainian forces retook the town, they discovered bodies strewn in Yablunska Street, where they had been shot. It was the first the outside world knew of the horrors Bucha had endured during 33 days of occupation. ""We have a moral obligation to support the families who live on that street, because more than 70 civilians were brutally killed and tortured there,"" explains the local mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk. Yablunska Street and the area around has been cleaned, spruced up and in some places rebuilt. But the Russians took over ""almost every yard or house"", according to the mayor, who estimates the total cost of repair at €1.6bn (£1.4bn; $1.7bn). ""Of course we don't have this sum. But we are doing whatever we can to return people to their houses."" Just a few steps from Yablunska Street, Ludmila's new home is still just a shell. The builders have promised to finish it by summer, but she hasn't seen them for days. Homeless for two years, on top of her bereavement, Ludmila is anxious to move in. ""I'm trying to cope, but my blood pressure is high, which it never was before the war,"" she says, showing me around the building site. ""I'm getting heart scans, signs of problems. It's all from the stress. From the memories."" In 2022, I saw the burned-out wreck of Ludmila's old home not long after the Russians had pulled out. The yard was still heaped with alcohol bottles and wrappers from their military ration packs. It was the rubbish of men who had shot Ludmila's husband in the head when he surfaced for a moment from the cellar where the couple were hiding. She found Valeriy's body later that night, face down on their porch. The investigation is still open, one of hundreds of suspected war crimes cases in Bucha. Ludmila was recently called in by police who had found new CCTV footage and hoped she might help identify the soldiers on film. ""Maybe they can be charged in absentia. I know Russia will never hand them over,"" Ludmila says, realistic about the chances of anyone being held to account for the killing. ""Personally, I'd like to grab them by the throat and demand to know why they had to come here,"" she says, suddenly animated. ""They are scumbags."" Behind the white walls of St Andrew's Church, where many were buried in a mass grave during the occupation, there is now a memorial wall of metal plaques. So far it displays 509 names. Some squares are still blank because there are more than 100 unidentified bodies at the town cemetery, unearthed from shallow graves all over Bucha and reburied. DNA samples were taken first, in the hope that someone would one day come looking for them. Other plaques on the memorial wall have no death date - only the month of March, when Bucha was under Russian occupation. Opposite is a sign that lists the dozens of people still missing. Among the names is Bohdan Kostyrenko, whose wife Natalia I first met in 2022. I was investigating the killing of five men from Bucha whose bodies had been found beneath a children's summer camp. Natalia's husband had been taken away by Russian soldiers and she feared he might be one of the dead. He wasn't. After months of searching, she finally traced Bohdan to a prison in Russia. ""They took him to Belarus, then to Detention Centre Number Two in Bryansk [in Russia],"" Natalia says. Through other Ukrainians swapped for Russian POWs, she learned that he was then moved to a facility in Tula, south of Moscow. ""Russia has officially confirmed he's a prisoner, but I had to find him through my own contacts,"" she tells me. ""They should just give the civilians back, but they don't."" Bohdan retired from the army in 2019 with PTSD. As a civilian prisoner, Natalia fears his chances of being exchanged are slim, as only a few dozen non-combatants have been returned so far. ""There are a lot of civilians from Bucha missing - people we know are in prison, but the Russians haven't confirmed. At least they've admitted to having Bohdan, officially."" Natalia has heard nothing from her husband directly since he was taken. But she knows from others held in Bryansk that they were tortured. ""They say it was really hard - they were not fed, they were badly beaten, including with electric shock and pipes,"" she tells me. ""Now I don't know what else to do. I can't get him freed. I can't find any way to do it."" Natalia herself is ethnically Russian. Both her parents are from the country now holding her husband prisoner illegally and accused of abusing him. It was people like Natalia that Vladimir Putin used as his excuse for invading Ukraine. He claimed they needed saving from brutal treatment at the hands of a ""Nazi"" government in Kyiv. As we talk in the yard, children play football, laughing and shouting. Most of the pre-war population of Bucha has returned, including many who fled Ukraine as refugees. But Natalia worries things could deteriorate again. ""You see what Putin's up to, blaming Ukraine for the Moscow terrorist attack,"" she tells me, referring to last month's attack on the Crocus concert venue. ""I think he wants a full war. Full mobilisation."" Across town, Ludmila is worried too, especially by the recent increase in Russian missile strikes. She keeps visiting her house to check on its progress and to be closer to her memories from before the occupation. She feeds Murka, the stray cat Valeriy once loved to photograph. Gardening distracts her when everything gets too much. ""There's such ruin, all over Ukraine! They're rebuilding here in Bucha and that's such joy. But there's no peace, no stability."" Ludmila shows me purple crocuses and bluebells in neat rows and the green shoots of daffodils. Then she leads me past the porch where Valeriy was shot, through a wooden gate onto the plot of land where she buried him. ""Look how many tulips are coming out!"" Ludmila points towards the spot, now a neat flowerbed again. ""It used to be so lovely here. We'll soon have flowers again, all round the house.""",2024-04-08,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68755814,politics
348,Peter Pellegrini: Russia-friendly populist elected Slovak president,"Populist Peter Pellegrini has been elected president of Slovakia, succeeding the liberal Zuzana Caputova. Mr Pellegrini, 48, defeated the pro-Western Ivan Korčok, a former diplomat, with 53% of the vote. A former prime minister, he is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and shares the PM's dovish attitude towards Russia. Mr Fico and his allies now control Slovakia's parliament, government, and soon the president's office. Slovakia had been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies before Mr Fico came to power in October on a pledge to halt supplies of Slovak Army military stocks to Kyiv. With Mr Pellegrini replacing Mrs Caputova, Ukraine has now definitively lost a voice of support in an EU and Nato capital. Mr Fico has called for an end to Western military support for Ukraine, an immediate ceasefire, and peace talks with Moscow. He said recently President Vladimir Putin had been ""unfairly demonised"" and argued admitting Ukraine to Nato would mark the beginning of a third world war. Mr Pellegrini's campaign echoed some of that Moscow-friendly rhetoric, accusing Mr Korčok of being a warmonger who would send Slovak soldiers to fight in Ukraine - a constitutional power the president does not have. On Sunday Mr Pellegrini vowed ""to ensure that Slovakia remains on the side of peace and not on the side of war"". ""You don't have to worry that the Presidential Palace, as it has been for the last 10 years, will become a centre of oppositional, opportunistic power that will harm the government, that will harm the state abroad and will rejoice in the failures of the Slovak government,"" he said. Once Mrs Caputova steps down in June, there will no longer be any high-level official in Slovakia - a country which barely a year ago donated its entire fleet of MiG-29 aircraft to Ukraine - who unequivocally backs Kyiv's effort to defend its territory with force. Mr Korčok expressed his anger at Mr Pellegrini's campaign tactics, saying it was fear that decided the outcome of the election, and ""that fear was spread by those who are hidden in state positions"". He said of the result: ""It turns out that it is possible to become President of the Slovak Republic not only by spreading hatred, whipping up passions and pushing people to the barricades, but also by painting the opposite number, that is to say, me, as a candidate of war. I will not forget this."" The liberal pro-Western opposition also accuses Mr Pellegrini - as head of the coalition Hlas party and chairman of parliament - of remaining silent as Mr Fico took a wrecking ball to Slovakia's criminal justice system, notably abolishing the Special Prosecutor's Office, which was set up 20 years ago to probe serious corruption and economic crime. It had investigated a number of senior officials in Mr Fico's Smer party, and had been overseeing the prosecution of those believed to be responsible for the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova in 2018. The killings were a seismic event in Slovak politics. The fallout ended Mr Fico's second premiership in 2018 and led to the liberal, pro-Western Zuzana Caputova being elected president on a wave of popular anger at official corruption and organised crime. Robert Fico's government recently set its sights on Slovakia's public broadcaster, submitting plans to abolish the institution and replace it with one under virtual state control. Those plans were put on the back burner after a surprisingly poor showing from Peter Pellegrini in the first round of the presidential election two weeks ago. The opposition fears a reinvigorated Robert Fico will resubmit them - and they say President-elect Pellegrini is unlikely to stand in his way.",2024-04-07,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68754112,politics
349,"Ukraine war: Russian drone strikes on Kharkiv kill seven, officials say","At least seven people have been killed in Russian drone attacks on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, officials say. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said six people were killed when Iranian-made Shahed drones hit several buildings, including apartment blocks, early on Saturday. Another person was killed in a second strike on a residential area, he added. Attacks on Kharkiv, the closest big city to the Russian border, have been intensifying in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials have said the city might be the target of a future Russian offensive. ""This attack on peaceful residents of Kharkiv once again proves that Russia is a terrorist state,"" Mr Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app after the first attack. At least 11 people were injured by the attack in the residential Shevchenkivskyi district, according to the local prosecutor's office. It said high-rise buildings, administrative buildings, dormitories, a kindergarten, shops, cafes and cars were damaged. Unverified photos published by Ukrainian police showed rescuers at the scene, with damaged and burning buildings visible. Local police said Moscow fired two missiles, followed by ""repeated shelling"", and then drones which attacked during the rescue operations. Volodymyr Tymoshko, of the local police force, said on social media: ""When all relevant services were working at the site of the missile hit, enemy drones arrived."" Ukraine's second-largest city has suffered extensive damage from months of Russian bombardment since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Polish authorities said fighter jets had been scrambled in response to the latest missile attacks on Ukraine. Authorities in Kyiv said air defences had been activated to repel an attack on the capital. Ukraine's military said its air defences destroyed 28 of 32 drones and three of six missiles launched by Russia. On Thursday, Russian forces attacked Kharkiv with drones, leaving at least four dead, according to Ukrainian officials. And on Friday, authorities said four people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.",2024-04-06,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68747752,politics
350,"Laura Kuenssberg: West facing 'authoritarian' alliance, says Nato chief","An ""alliance of authoritarian powers"" is working more closely together against Western democracies, the head of Nato has warned. Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned. He also said he was confident allies of the Nato military alliance would agree a long-term funding deal for Ukraine by July. But he suggested Ukraine might have to decide on some ""kind of compromises"". Mr Stoltenberg was speaking to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday morning. On the Middle East conflict, he said it was ""very important"" that the US and other Nato countries conveyed ""a very clear message to Israel"" that they have to do ""significantly more"" to protect civilians and aid workers after the World Central Kitchen convoy attack . Mr Stoltenberg took over as the leader of Nato, the Western defence alliance, 10 years ago. Speaking to mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation, he told me the world was now ""much more dangerous, much more unpredictable"" and ""much more violent"". He said there is an ""authoritarian"" alliance giving each other practical support that is ""more and more aligned"". The Nato chief explained: ""China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing."" Russia was providing technology to Iran and North Korea in return for ammunition and military equipment, he added. Mr Stoltenberg told me that Nato had to work with other countries beyond its geography - such as Japan and South Korea - to ""stand up against this stronger alliance of authoritarian powers"". The Nato chief has been trying to persuade other countries to commit more money to the war effort in Ukraine in recent days in the hope of a five-year, 100bn euro (£86bn) fund. He said he was confident he would get an agreement by July, despite some countries expressing hesitation this week . Long-term support was vital now, and to rebuild the country after the conflict, he said. ""Even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future, we need to support Ukraine for many years, to build their defences to deter future aggression,"" he said.

However, while Mr Stoltenberg said that military support was vital to repel Russian forces from Ukraine and force Putin to give up his goals of occupation, he also suggested that Ukraine might ultimately have to make concessions too. ""At the end of the day, it has to be Ukraine that decides what kind of compromises they're willing to do, we need to enable them to be in a position where they actually achieve an acceptable result around the negotiating table,"" he said. He said he was not calling for Ukraine to offer concessions now, and added that ""real peace"" would be achievable when ""Ukraine prevails"". But his language is notable because President Volodymyr Zelensky has always been adamant that he would never negotiate with Putin despite some calls on him to do so, including from the Pope. Mr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether he was concerned about the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, saying only that he was sure the US would continue to be an important ally, whoever was in charge. But his remarks about the way regimes around the world are working together are a reminder for Western leaders of the complicated and dangerous diplomatic jigsaw they have to piece together. More than two years into the conflict in Ukraine, our politicians must grapple with the reality that what is happening there is affected by decisions not just in Moscow and Kyiv but also in Washington DC, Brussels and London, as well as Beijing, Tehran and even Pyongyang. Meanwhile, six months into the Middle East conflict in Gaza, as Jeremy Bowen writes , solutions are affected by decisions not just by Israelis and Palestinians, but also Iranians, politicians in the US, the Gulf States and the UK. Most recently, this has centred on a row over arms sales, prompting criticism of the government from all sides. The latest intervention came on Saturday morning from one former Conservative prime minister , Boris Johnson, to another, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron. Foreign policy is rarely the overwhelming driver of votes and public opinion in the UK. This is partly because opposition parties traditionally try to avoid fights at home about battles abroad. It's also partly because voters' top priorities normally centre on their own lives and the prospects for their families. But that does not mean that the public doesn't care, or is immune from the horror they see unfolding on their screens every day, or hasn't been affected by world events - take, for instance, the huge energy price rises caused by the Ukraine conflict. And conflicts around the world in all their complexities are increasingly occupying our politicians' time, energy and effort.",2024-04-06,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68743805,politics
351,"Ukraine war: Six Russian planes destroyed by drones, says Kyiv","Ukraine has carried out a drone attack against targets in southern Russia and claims to have destroyed six Russian planes at an airbase in Rostov region. Security sources told BBC Ukrainian eight more aircraft were badly damaged, while 20 service personnel could have been killed or injured. The Morozovsk base houses Su-27 and Su-34 aircraft used on the front line in Ukraine, the sources said. There has been no word from Russia on reports of an airfield attack. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the reports. However, Russian officials said that more than 40 drones had been aimed at the region, which borders Ukraine. BBC Russian military analyst Pavel Aksyonov says an attack by so many drones over a short space of time could have overwhelmed air defences. Meanwhile, four people were killed and over 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said. The eastern city of Kharkiv also came under air attack, with local authorities reporting two deaths from the Russian bombardment. In Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said several high-rise blocks and private homes were damaged. Two missiles struck first, and then - after rescuers and police arrived - three more hit, he added. Ukrainian media said several journalists were among the injured. Earlier, Ukraine's air force said that overnight and into Friday, Russia had attacked Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions and Kharkiv with 13 drones and five missiles. All the drones were shot down, it said, but energy facilities were damaged in Odesa region, as well as residential buildings in Kharkiv. Also, Russian troops continued their slow advance in Donetsk region. Ukrainian officials said the town of Chasiv Yar was coming under constant bombardment amid reports that Russian forces had reached the outskirts. Reporting the Rostov attacks, the Russian defence ministry said Saratov, Kursk, Belgorod and Krasnodar regions had also been targeted. It said all the drones involved were shot down. In Rostov's Morozovsk district, an electrical sub-station was hit, leaving about 600 people without power for a few hours, Rostov governor Vasily Golubev said on his Telegram channel. He added that there had been some damage to a 16-storey residential block. In a later post, he said eight people had been injured by explosives detonating on one of the fallen drones during an investigation of the site ""not far from the aerodrome"". Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on targets within Russia recently, targeting military and energy facilities. It has warned repeatedly that its army is facing severe ammunition shortages, but has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year. On Tuesday it claimed responsibility for a drone attack in Tatarstan, more than 1,300km (807 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border. The strikes, targeting a drone factory and an oil refinery, are the deepest into Russian territory since the start of the war. Twelve people were reported injured.",2024-04-06,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68740094,politics
352,Oleksandr Zinchenko: Arsenal footballer would fight in Ukraine if called up,"Arsenal footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko says he would leave the UK to fight in Ukraine if he was called up. The 27-year-old told BBC Newsnight he has donated about £1m to help people in his home country since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. He said Ukraine has become a ""shield"" for Europe and called for more support. On Wednesday, the country's president signed into law a bill lowering the military mobilisation age from 27 to 25. This would allow the country to call up more people to replenish its reserves and comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky said in December that the country would need 500,000 more soldiers to be mobilised. BBC Newsnight asked the footballer whether he would answer a call-up to fight, if he saw more value in that than staying to play football in the Premier League. ""I think it's a clear answer. I would go [to fight]"", he said. He added that he had former school friends fighting on the frontline. ""It's tough to understand that just recently we've been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,"" he said. ""And, honestly, [it's] so hard to accept this, but it is what it is. We cannot give up."" Mr Zinchenko said the situation in the country is ""super tough"" but he and his family were ""proud of our president"". ""I know maybe some people might think that it's much easier … for me being here [in London] rather than being there [in Ukraine]. I really hope that this war will end soon,"" he said. The Arsenal defender began his football career with Russian team Ufa in 2016, and said he no longer talks to his friends or former teammates that are in Russia. ""Since the invasion really few [have] texted mebut I stopped any communication since February 2022. They sent me some messages and I can't blame them because this is not their fault,"" he said. ""I cannot tell them, 'Guys, do the protests outside and all these things', because I know they can be [put] in prison. ""But I have a question to the people of Russia - how do you live in the country where you don't have a freedom of speech at all?"" He said Russians used to call Ukrainians their ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but the invasion has shown ""all of us Ukrainians that we can't be friends with them any more"". ""We will never forget what they have done to us, to our people,"" he said. ""And that's what I will teach my kids as well. And my kids will teach their kids. This is not acceptable."" In February, President Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during Russia's full-scale invasion and tens of thousands of civilians had died in areas of the country occupied by Russia. In the first few days of the invasion, Mr Zinchenko said he sent money to help refugees in Ukraine, and his donations have amounted to over £1m. He added that he knows of hundreds of children whose parents have died in the war. The Arsenal star said: ""What is my duty now? How can I help as much as I can to my country, to my people, over there and all these things? ""I can't be more proud than I am right now to be Ukrainian. ""I have a dream that this war will end very, very soon, and we can rebuild our Ukraine like we really want [to]."" Additional reporting by Tetiana Kharchenko and Jasmin Dyer.

353,"Europe and US need each other, Nato chief Stoltenberg says","Europe and the US need each other and are ""stronger together"", the secretary-general of Nato has said. Jens Stoltenberg was speaking at a ceremony marking the alliance's 75th anniversary. While the US provided Europe with security, he said it also needed the militaries, intelligence and diplomatic leverage of its European allies. ""I don't believe in America alone just as I don't believe in Europe alone,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""I believe in America and Europe together in Nato, because we are stronger and safer together."" The Nato chief's remarks came as the alliance considered a €100bn (£86bn) five-year fund to provide long-term military support for Ukraine, so aid to Kyiv is not jeopardised by political changes either in the US or other Nato states. A US package worth $60bn (£47bn) has been stalled in Congress for months because of resistance from Republican lawmakers, as well as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has spoken of ending the war ""in one day"". During his speech, Mr Stoltenberg said Nato must be ""doing something right"", as it had grown from 12 countries at its inception to 32. Its newest members Sweden and Finland abandoned their neutrality and joined the alliance as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to the speech that relations between Russia and Nato had ""slid to the level of direct confrontation"" as the alliance was already ""involved"" in the conflict around Ukraine. Although Nato is a defensive alliance Mr Peskov alleged it ""was conceived, configured, created and controlled by the US as a tool of confrontation"" and was now a ""destabilising element"". The 32-member alliance has agreed to initiate planning for long-term military support for Ukraine. Several countries have only backed the initiative in theory. Hungary, which has kept close ties with Russia, has warned it will not back ""any Nato proposals proposals that might draw the alliance closer to war or shift it from a defensive to an offensive coalition"". The Hungarian government has long sought to distance itself from international initiatives to fund Ukraine's fight against Russia, and for a period blocked a EU plan to provide a €50bn (£43bn) aid package for Ukraine. Mr Stoltenberg acknowledged the framework of support was yet to be decided, but said Nato foreign ministers had agreed on the principle: ""Make no mistake, Ukraine can rely on Nato support now and for the long haul."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters support for Ukraine within the alliance is ""rock solid"" and that he believes Ukraine will eventually become a member of Nato, Reuters reported. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters at Nato headquarters that while he did not want to ""spoil [Nato]'s birthday party"", his country needed help in improving its air defences - specifically Patriot missiles. ""Saving Ukrainian lives, saving the Ukrainian economy and saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of Patriots and other air defence systems,"" Mr Kuleba said. Lacking air superiority and faced with formidable Russian defences, Ukraine's counter-offensive ground to a halt last year and is now at risk of being outgunned on the front line in the east. The US has given Ukraine more financial aid than any other Nato state- more than $44bn (£34bn) since the 2022 invasion, according to the White House in December. However, its aid has now become caught up in a political row months before the presidential election. Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticised the level of spending. He has also long complained that the US has shouldered a greater financial burden than the rest of the alliance. Fewer than two-thirds of Nato members are on course to reach their 2% funding goal. Highlighting the importance of Nato's European allies to the US, Mr Stoltenberg noted it was America's allies that came to its help after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That was the only occasion that a key principle of the alliance has been invoked, in which an attack on one ally is seen as an attack on all. Nato allies closest to Russia have stepped up efforts to boost their armed forces. Norway is increasing its number of conscripted soldiers, while Denmark says it intends to extend conscription to women and increase the duration of service. Latvia and Sweden recently restarted military service, while Lithuania brought it back after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

354,"Paris 2024: Russia seeking to undermine Games, says Emmanuel Macron","Russia is running a disinformation campaign to undermine the Paris Olympics, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. At the inauguration of a new Olympic swimming centre, reporters asked if he thought Russia was targeting the Games. ""Without a doubt,"" he said, ""including in the field of information. ""Every day (Russia) is putting out stories saying that we are unable to do this or that, so (the Games) would be at risk."" The French government says Russia has recently stepped up propaganda attacks on France, using fake accounts on social media to spread rumours and disinformation. It follows Mr Macron's switch to a more hard-line policy on the Ukraine war , to which he no longer refuses to rule out eventually sending French troops on the side of Kyiv. France believes Russian intelligence was behind the daubing of Israeli Stars of David on Paris walls after the October 7 Hamas attacks, in what was interpreted as a bid to stir up divisions in France. A network of Russian-created websites named Portal Kombat is accused of spreading made-up stories, such as claims that French mercenaries are already serving in Ukraine, or that Mr Macron cancelled a trip to Kyiv because of fears of an assassination attempt. After the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack near Moscow, the French and Russian defence ministers had a rare telephone exchange on Wednesday. According to Mr Macron, this was because France had intelligence information that could help the Russians know more about the alleged attackers, from the Afghan section of the Islamic State group. In his account of their conversation, French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said he told his counterpart Sergei Shoigu that France was concerned about Russian claims that Kyiv was behind the Crocus City Hall attack - claims for which France said there was no evidence. But in his account of the phone call, Mr Shoigu said: ""The Kyiv regime does nothing without the approval of its western minders. We hope that in the case (of the Crocus City Hall attack) the French secret services are not involved."" Asked about Mr Shoigu's remarks on Thursday, Mr Macron said they were ""bizarre and menacing … ridiculous."" The president confirmed for the first time that there are alternative plans for the Olympics opening ceremony in July, if the terrorist threat worsens. Currently the 26 July ceremony is supposed to take place on boats in the river Seine, with more than 300,000 people watching from the quays. However experts have warned that the occasion is highly vulnerable to terrorist attack. ""We will be ready,"" Mr Macron said. ""We are preparing several scenarios. If the threat were to evolve, if we considered that circumstances made it necessary, we have back-up scenarios."" Mr Macron also lent his support to the popular French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, whose name has been mentioned as a possible performer at the opening ceremony.  Critics on the hard-right of French politics say she would not be a good ambassador because the language of her songs is often crude and difficult to understand. ""She speaks to a good number of our fellow citizens and I believe she has every right to be at the opening or closing ceremonies of the Games,"" the president said.",2024-04-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68733267,politics
355,Lord Cameron rules out Western boots on the ground in Ukraine,"Lord Cameron has ruled out Western troops being sent into Ukraine to avoid giving Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a target"". The foreign secretary acknowledged that the ""war will be lost if the allies don't step up"" on the BBC's Ukrainecast podcast. But asked whether Western nations should send troops into Ukraine, Lord Cameron replied ""no"". He added Nato must be in the ""best possible shape"" by the US elections. Lord Cameron was speaking at a two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) summit of 32 foreign ministers in Brussels. Nato boss Jens Stoltenberg has floated plans for a 100 billion euro (£86bn), five-year package of military aid to Ukraine, with the aim of finalising a package in time for the next summit in Washington in July. The move is aimed at allaying concerns around the outcome of the US election in November, with candidate Donald Trump suggesting the US could cut support , and claiming some Nato members were not paying their way. One diplomat, quoted by the Reuters news agency, suggested the package ""goes some way to protecting in case of Trump. But it is impossible to create something Trump-proof"". Lord Cameron said he'd be making his second visit to the United States since becoming foreign secretary next week and would be urging Congress to give more financial support, which ""could change the narrative"" in Ukraine. Nato would have to work with whoever wins this year's US election, he said, so now was the time to get into ""the best possible shape by November"" - alluding to complaints from candidate Mr Trump. He told Ukrainecast: ""If we can get that money out of the US Congress, if we can get Ukraine the arms they need, if we can show Putin that he can't outwait us and that Ukraine is going to fight back and win back more of its territory. ""If we can do all those things, whoever gets in in November, we'll look at the situation in Ukraine and... look at more and more Nato members spending 2% of their GDP on defence and say, this is a success story. I want to invest in this success. ""So turn Ukraine in the situation and Nato into the strongest possible alliance with the strongest possible prospect of success. And whoever wins in November 2024 would inherit a better situation."" The UK is a founding member of Nato, formed 75 years ago by countries including the US, Canada and France in order to block expansion by the Soviet Union - a group of communist states which included Russia. Some Nato members have sent weapons to Ukraine, with the UK, US, Germany and Turkey providing anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones. The US and UK have also supplied long-range missiles. Nato countries have not sent troops to Ukraine, and ruled out using their air forces to impose a no-fly zone over the country, because of fears such action could provoke a direct conflict with Russia. But the Russian invasion has rebooted conscription, particularly among countries living on Russia's doorstep . Asked about fears the war could still spill over the Ukrainian border, particularly in Poland and the Baltics, Lord Cameron gave assurances that Nato would intervene in those circumstances, under the organisation's Article 5 pledge that ""an attack on one is an attack on all"". But he ruled out Western ""boots on the ground"" in Ukraine itself, saying: ""We don't want to give Putin a target like that."" The former prime minister said the UK would use the ""architecture of Nato"" to deliver support to Ukraine but drew a distinction between a Nato mission ""for Ukraine"" as opposed to ""in Ukraine"". He added: ""I think it's not escalatory to say we're going to help this independent, sovereign country to fight off an aggressor and we're going to give it all the help we can  in order to do that."" Britain has given Ukraine more than £7bn and trained more than 60,000 Ukrainian soldiers, in a programme started under Mr Cameron's tenure as PM. But the foreign secretary urged other countries backing Ukraine to also step up, perhaps by donating weapons. ""Some weapons have an expiration date,"" he said. ""Much better to give those to Ukraine and they can use them than have to decommission them at home that actually costs you money."" Ukrainecast host Lucy Hockings tried to ask the foreign secretary about his views on the Israel-Gaza conflict but he declined to comment, saying he wanted to focus on Ukraine.",2024-04-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68730246,politics

Janie Penn-Barwell from Eastleigh was one of thousands across the UK to get involved in a scheme housing displaced families after the Russian invasion. Ms Penn-Barwell hosted Oksana and her two daughters, Lena and Yara, for 18 months and has since bought a home for them to live in. Oksana said she felt like she could stop running after receiving the keys. Oksana said: ""It's wonderful, I had a feeling that I was running, running, running and finally I have stopped. I just relax and let them [her daughters] do what they want and have their dreams come true. ""I try to work as much as I can, try to take more hours and try to be useful."" Ms Penn-Barwell got a mortgage to purchase the property, which she now rents out to Oksana and acts as landlady, she said she is ""really proud"" of how they have settled in. She said: ""It wasn't so much that we were too crowded and fighting or anything like that, absolutely not, but it seemed sensible that they needed a home of their own. ""I guess it seemed obvious because there wasn't anywhere else to rent and I thought if you can do it, you should do it - so I could, so I did."" Ms Penn-Barwell added: ""I'm not a wildly wealthy woman, far from it, I have an NHS pension but you know, if you don't need things, why not do something useful?"" Oksana and her daughters have been living in their new home for six months now and Lena and Yara are studying for their GCSEs and A Levels. Yara, 15, said: ""It's wonderful, I really like that I have my own bedroom and I can decorate it myself how I want. It feels more free I would say."" Lena, 18, added: ""I do like that me and my sister have separate bedrooms because now I can keep my room neat and tidy and I really like living close to Janie still. Having a home of our own where we can speak Ukrainian together, it's very nice."" Yara and Lena said Ms Penn-Barwell has become part of their family and they now fondly refer to her as ""Granny."" Oksana added: ""She's definitely a member of our family. I don't see her as much as I'd like now, I miss her, she really can make my day better.

357,Ukrainians returning home to get dental treatment,"A Ukrainian mother living in Wiltshire says she returned to her war-torn country because she could not access NHS dental care. Natalia Negreba has recently had root canal work done in the city of Dnipro. The 36-year-old said she was in ""excruciating"" pain, but could not find NHS dental care or afford to pay for private treatment. The care board that covers Wiltshire said it had laid on ""additional urgent dental care appointments"" since 2021. Dnipro, which is fewer than 100km (62 miles) from the front line, was on the receiving end of a devastating wave of attacks by Russian forces in December. The Ukrainian air force said it had ""never seen so many locations targeted simultaneously"" after Russia launched 158 drones and missiles . Despite the danger the city has faced since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, Mrs Negriba says she returned with her three-year-old daughter Agnia in July 2023 because she was in so much pain. ""I started looking for a dentist but I didn't find any [NHS clinics]. It was very terrible because I took paracetamol and ibuprofen every day. My pain didn't go away,"" she said. ""My friend helped me make an appointment at a private clinic in Corsham but it would have cost £800 - which was too much for me, it's very expensive. ""Dnipro is very dangerous, and I was very worried when I went [back], but my pain was very strong. I could not stay here."" Mrs Negriba, who moved to Corsham at the start of the war, told the BBC she would often hear air raid alarms when she was in Dnipro, where her treatment cost about £150 for a root canal procedure and an implant. She said she also has a friend from Chippenham who had also travelled to Dnipro for dental care. Mrs Negriba added: ""I had a very long wait, too much. I didn't find an NHS dentist. ""If I have a new problem with my tooth, I will fly to Ukraine to have it fixed again."" Liz Taylor, from Chippenham, runs Bybrook Homes for Ukraine, which supports about 50 Ukrainian refugees living in Wiltshire. She said other patients have revisited their mother country to get dental care, with some of them having ""severe dental problems"". ""We've either had to pay ourselves for them to receive treatment, or they have gone back to Ukraine - much to our horror - and to some of the really dangerous parts of Ukraine in the east, near the Russian border, because of toothache,"" said Mrs Taylor. She added that she was also supporting another woman who was considering going back to Kharkiv, which is right next to the front line and a place Mrs Taylor considers even more dangerous than Dnipro. Kateryna Lagun, Mrs Negriba's dentist in Dnipro, said she had treated several Ukrainians who had travelled from the UK. ""We have a lot of people coming from outside of Ukraine to get their treatment,"" she said. ""Dnipro is quite dangerous because we have a lot of air attacks at night, and up to 15 air raid warnings a day. ""I live really close to the [bombed] factory here and several times I thought it was the end because it [the bombing] was really close to us. ""I guess they do not have much choice in the UK. I heard you have this situation with NHS dentistry and even UK citizens cannot get the proper treatment."" A spokesperson for the Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Integrated Care Board said it would not comment on individual cases but that in this case Mrs Negriba may meet the criteria for ""an urgent dental or a stabilisation appointment"". ""Since September 2021 we have commissioned additional urgent dental care appointments that people can access by calling NHS111 with an urgent dental need,"" they added. ""There are 390 appointments every week across the South West, with 86 urgent dental appointments in Wiltshire each week."" The board said there were also 750 stabilisation appointments across the South West, which were for people who had a serious but not urgent dental issue. It said Mrs Negriba should contact the board to discuss her treatment. Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook , X and Instagram .

358,Russia’s neighbours urge Nato allies to bring back military service,"Rain drips down the glasses of new recruit Toivo Saabas, tracing the contours of the green and black face paint that completes his camouflage. Lying on the saturated ground, and peering through the sight of his gun, the only frailty that threatens to give away his position is the plume of air he breathes out silently into the icy Estonian forest. Then comes the deafening call to attack. The 25-year-old springs to his feet. Forming a line with his brothers in arms, he bounds through the trees towards the Russian border. As he advances to the clatter of enemy fire, the Southampton University mechanical engineering graduate knows that one day this could all be for real. ""We're practising for any threat,"" he says. ""We're ready for anything that comes to Estonia and we're ready to defend the country."" Toivo, from the capital Tallinn, is among the current crop of young Estonians undergoing their military service - a duty all men over 18 are asked to carry out. For women, it's voluntary. As the Cold War ended, and relations with post-Soviet Russia warmed in the 1990s, conscription appeared consigned to history in many parts of Europe. But not in Estonia, where it would have been impossible for the collective pain of occupation and deportation to have faded away. And now, following President Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, conscription is being rebooted and expanded across Europe, with those living on Russia's doorstep urging their Nato allies further afield, including the UK, to follow suit. This week Norway announced it was increasing the number of conscripted soldiers after Denmark said last month it intends to extend conscription to women and increase the duration of service. Latvia and Sweden recently restarted military service and Lithuania brought it back after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""It takes a toll on you,"" says a drenched Toivo, explaining that the training has been the toughest experience of his life. ""But in the end, it's service for your country. Being prepared for anything is better than kind of sneaking off and trying to evade this service."" Rain has turned to hail and then to snow in a matter of minutes. Everyone is soaked to their skin. But as the simulation ends, relief quickly leads to animated conversation and laughter eclipsing the hardship of the previous hours. ""It's the conscripts in Ukraine I feel sorry for,"" says Captain Mikk Haabma who is overseeing proceedings. ""They are fighting for their lives."" Standing more than 2m tall, the 38-year-old has a natural advantage when it comes to surveying the progress of his new intake. ""Our country is based on reserves and these guys are filling the slots all the time. But also, they're getting the skills to get by in life - especially building their confidence. In a few weeks from now, these guys will be ready to fight the enemy."" He means Russia. Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, whose collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. Indeed, the Kremlin ridicules suggestions it might. Three Nato countries - the UK, the US and France - each have nuclear weapons, as does Russia, so there would be concerns over the risk of nuclear escalation as a result of such a conflict. However, if the Russians did attack, I ask, what would they be confronted with? ""A massive defeat,"" Captain Haabma replies. ""Of course, they have the numbers, but in the end on a strategic level we have Nato and the technical superiority."" The transatlantic military alliance - now a club of 32 including new members Finland and Sweden - is celebrating its 75th anniversary this week. So what is the overwhelming feeling in Estonia today? A sense of security being part of an enlarged alliance? Or fear about what Vladimir Putin may do next? ""I think it's both,"" replies Kaja Kallas in her prime ministerial office in Tallinn. For her, Nato allies keeping their promise to spend 2% of GDP on defence is what's crucial. ""In 1938, it was clear that the war was coming so the defence expenditure was increased by 100% but it was already too late."" She continues, ""This is what we have to do now in order to preserve our way of living, in order to preserve peace in Europe."" However, in 2024, fewer than two thirds of Nato members are on course to reach their 2% funding goal, a shortfall that perpetually irked US President Donald Trump during his time in the White House. Ms Kallas, who's led Estonia since 2021, sees conscription as another integral part of both providing a deterrence to Russia but also stronger defence if it does attack. ""We have a reserve army of 44,000 people that would equal, for Great Britain, around two million people. Two million people who are ready to defend their country and know what they have to do."" After she mentions Britain unprompted, I ask whether she would in fact recommend conscription to the UK. ""Of course, every country decides for themselves, we are all democracies, but I recommend this in many aspects."" When I recall that the head of the British Army was rebuked by Downing Street after saying Britain should train a ""citizen army"" ready to fight a war on land in the future, Kallas widens her eyes. ""Well it doesn't surprise me because we have different historical backgrounds. We have lost our independence and freedom once and we don't want to lose it again. They say that you only understand freedom and what it means when you don't have it."" A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson told the BBC there is ""absolutely no suggestion of a return to conscription"". The British government says £50bn is being invested in its armed forces in 2024 to tackle multiple threats, including Russian aggression in Ukraine, and that ""increasing recruitment and improving retention across the services is a top priority"". Military service may well be going through a renaissance, but that doesn't mean all young Estonians are filled with unbridled enthusiasm for it. The warmth and buzz of F-Hoone bar in the centre of the capital is a far cry from the rain-soaked forest where the conscripts have been toiling away. The capital is gearing up for Tallinn Music Week, an annual celebration with live performances embracing a range of genres. Among those taking the stage will be The Boondocks - a four piece indie rock band originally formed in Pärnu, the coastal city in the south west of the country. ""I'm not a soldier"" sings 25-year-old Villem Sarapuu in their track Smokin' Aces. But every morning for two months he did in fact pull on military fatigues for his national service. ""To begin with, I really didn't want to do it,"" he confides. ""I don't think there are many people who are voluntarily going there."" He says at first it took a considerable mental toll. ""You're isolated from everyone and the wider world, but you're still in Tallinn so it's like a weird limbo."" After the initial physical training, Villem spent his remaining six months with the military orchestra ultimately performing at the Independence Day parade. ""My friends doing the real service were laughing at me - in a positive way. But I was doing the same thing: it's representing your country, you don't have to be in the trenches. Sitting next to him is band member Hendrik Tamberg, 28. As a conscientious objector, he was spared military service and instead spent a year caring for vulnerable adults with mental health problems. ""I found it incredibly rewarding but I didn't have the camaraderie of people going through the tough forest hikes. I did feel that I missed out on something."" As for lead singer Villem, he says he now looks back at his military training with happy memories and says it's a stark contrast to a deep collective unease his generation feels at the prospect that Russia may attack. ""If I think about the free will of people, conscription isn't a very nice thing to force people to do,"" he muses. ""But when it comes to a country such as Estonia, pretty small, it's absolutely necessary to recruit people to do this. Or this country won't exist any more.""

359,Ukraine gives award to foreign vigilantes for hacks on Russia,"A team of vigilante hackers carrying out cyber-attacks against Russia has been sent awards of gratitude by Ukraine's military. The team, One Fist, has stolen data from Russian military firms and hacked cameras to spy on troops. The certificates are a controversial sign of how modern warfare is shifting. Concerns have been raised about the practice of states encouraging civilian hackers. One of the hackers called ""Voltage"" has been co-ordinating hacks from his home in the US. His real name is Kristopher Kortright and he is an IT worker from Michigan. The 53-year-old told the BBC he is delighted his efforts for Ukraine have been officially recognised with a certificate of gratitude. One Fist is made up of hackers from eight different countries including the UK, US and Poland. They have collectively launched dozens of cyber-attacks - celebrating each one on social media. The certificates were sent to them all for ""a significant contribution to the development and maintenance of vital activities of the military"". They were signed by the commander of the Airborne Assault Forces of Ukraine. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has controversially been encouraging volunteer hackers to attack Russian targets. But sending out official awards to foreign civilians is being seen as a controversial move and a sign of the times. Although many nations, including the UK and the US, have official award systems for ethical hacking, this is thought to be the first time a country has awarded hackers for malicious and possibly criminal hacks. In October, in response to the increase in vigilante hacking in Ukraine and in the Gaza conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned against the use and encouragement of civilian hackers. It published guidelines to reinforce the ethos of the rules of war laid out in the existing Geneva Conventions. Dr Lukasz Olejnik, author of Philosophy of Cyber-security, said Ukraine's awards to foreign hackers are potentially problematic. ""Giving out awards may further blur the lines between combatants and civilians, and even undermine the recent call by the ICRC to limit and end the involvement of civilians in combat operations. In the long run, such an erosion is dangerous,"" he said. Dr Olejnik also said it is a ""testament of our times"" that cyber is now considered as a domain of operations and that anyone can join the fight online. Kristopher started hacking Russia when it launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and says he has devoted himself to the cause and sacrificed a lot. ""I've lost my job doing this and spent all my life savings in pursuit of a victory for Ukraine,"" he said from his home office. ""This award is a real morale-booster,"" he said. The awards do not state which cyber-attacks were most useful, but Voltage has three in mind as the most likely candidates. At the start of the invasion in 2022, One Fist spent months mapping out the physical and cyber-locations of hundreds of publicly viewable CCTV cameras in Ukraine. It was discovered that Russian forces were using them to monitor troops, so his team helped get the cameras switched off. Conversely, it was One Fist that hacked into cameras in occupied Crimea to catalogue Russian tanks and equipment being moved over the Kerch bridge. And most recently, in January, Kristopher and others also successfully hacked into a prominent Russian weapons-maker and stole 100 gigabytes of private data, which led to a public celebration from the Ukrainian authorities. ""The array of information transferred to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine contains drawings, specifications, patents, software referring to both existing and promising military developments,"" the announcement said. Ukraine added that the data stolen was a ""significant blow"" to Moscow and worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) - although it did not say how this figure was reached The Ukraine conflict prompted a surge of cyber-activity - mostly from supporters of Ukraine. Groups like the Anonymous collective targeted Russia with disruptive and low-level hacks that Russia largely brushed off. In some instances, TV and radio stations were hijacked and news websites defaced. Russian authorities too have been accused of working with vigilante hacking groups like Killnet to attack Ukraine, but has never admitted having any relationship to the gangs. Most of the vigilante hacking activity on both sides dissipated after the first year as the war ground on. But One Fist has kept attacking Russia and increasingly worked closely with the Ukrainian forces on choosing targets. Emily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs and editor of Chatham House Cyber Policy journal, agrees that the hacking awards are a landmark moment that might shift thinking about how cyber volunteers are used in conflicts. ""Governments usually discourage non-state actors from taking direct action in the cyber-domain, for fear of escalation or unintended consequences, but wartime is often a period of extraordinary technological innovation, and the Ukraine invasion is no exception,"" she said. ""Sometimes these events force a reconsideration of issues that have previously been taboo."" Kristopher says his team has built up a strong relationship with the Ukrainian military. ""They send us ideas and we send them options but they don't ever give us any help or funding as I think that would cross some sort of line,"" he said. Kristopher recognises that receiving military awards is controversial, but is determined to keep hacking for Ukraine.",2024-04-04,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68722542,politics
360,Ukraine lowers combat call-up age to boost numbers,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed into law a bill lowering the military mobilisation age by two years from 27 to 25. Kyiv and Moscow have both faced heavy losses on the battlefield after two years of war, but Russia has benefited from a sizeable advantage in manpower. The move will allow Ukraine to call up more people to replenish its reserves, after volunteer numbers dropped. Mr Zelensky said in December 500,000 more soldiers needed to be mobilised. But on Wednesday, he said: ""We don't need half-a-million."" Last week, Ukraine's top general said the required number of mobilised soldiers had been ""significantly reduced"" following a review of available resources. Ukraine's parliament approved the bill in May 2023, but it did not come into force because Mr Zelensky did not sign it. In a separate move, Nato foreign ministers in Brussels were discussing plans for a €100bn (£86bn) five-year fund to provide long-term military support for Ukraine. Asked if the figure was correct, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the framework was yet to be decided but Nato allies agreed that Ukraine needed more money and for many years. ""Make no mistake, Ukraine can rely on Nato support now and for the long haul."" Russia was ""pushing"" on the battlefield in Ukraine and trying to win the war by ""waiting us out"", Mr Stoltenberg said. It was not immediately clear what prompted President Zelensky to sign the bill and how many additional soldiers Ukraine could now get, although he has previously warned of plans Russia may have to launch a spring or summer offensive. And on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said Russia was ready to mobilise additional 300,000 troops in June. Russia's military has not commented on the claim. Ukrainian forces had hoped to take back swathes of territory gained by Russia as well as cutting off Russian supply lines to Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. But lacking air superiority and faced with formidable Russian defences, Kyiv's counter-offensive ground to a halt at the start of winter and there are fears that Russian forces could outgun Ukraine. In the past few months, Kyiv has been actively building defence fortifications amid steady Russian advances in eastern Ukraine, including the capture of the strategic town of Avdiivka. Last year, Ukrainian Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi warned troops had already been forced to downsize some military operations because of a drop-off in foreign aid. Ukraine has relied heavily on Western supplies, particularly on deliveries of long-range missiles and air defence systems. However, billions of pounds of US and EU aid have been held up amid political wrangles. In January 2024, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine's armed forces numbered 880,000, without specifying how many were actually fighting on the more than 1,200km-long (745 miles) frontline in the country's south-east. In February, he said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but US officials have put the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed as at least 70,000 and as many as 120,000 injured. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said more than 600,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine, but has not revealed how many have lost their lives there. A classified US intelligence report released in December estimated that 315,000 Russian soldiers had been either killed or wounded since the war began - which it said was almost 90% of Russia's military personnel at the start of the invasion. On Wednesday, Russia's defence ministry said more than 100,000 people had signed up to serve in the country's armed forces since the start of the year.",2024-04-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68719473,politics
361,Man's Ukraine anxiety affected ex-partner - judge,"A writer's anxiety about Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""very plainly"" had an impact on his ex-partner, a family court judge has ruled. The man was a member of an organisation known as the ""North Atlantic Fellas Organisation"" (""NAFO"") , Recorder Simon Rowbotham heard. He worked with ""NAFO"" to ""combat online Russian propaganda"", a private family court hearing in Northampton was told. Recorder Rowbotham said the man's obsession with ""NAFO"" was a ""feature"" of family life. Detail of the case has emerged in a ruling by the judge published online. The man and woman, who had lived together in Northamptonshire, are embroiled in a family court dispute over the care of their two children. Recorder Rowbotham said he had been asked to make rulings on a number of allegations the woman had made about the man's behaviour. The woman said she had been a victim of ""controlling and coercive behaviour"". One of her complaints related to his anxiety about Russia's attack on Ukraine. Her ex-partner, a ""writer and researcher"", disputed allegations made against him. The judge said the children at the centre of the case could not be identified in reports of his ruling. Recorder Rowbotham upheld some of the woman's allegations and dismissed others. He said there was evidence of a ""pattern of controlling behaviour"" which was ""subtle in places"" but "" nonetheless insidious"". The woman had described her former partner's ""ability to become obsessive"" over certain topics. Recorder Rowbotham said he had formed the same ""impression"". ""The main example concerns the father's anxiety around the Russian invasion of Ukraine and his involvement with an organisation known as the North Atlantic Fellas Organisation (""NAFO""), with whom it appears to be common ground the father worked to combat online Russian propaganda,"" said the judge. ""He describes this as a group 'using humour to fight misinformation on Twitter'."" Recorder Rowbotham said on one occasion the man had told the woman, at 03:00, that a Ukrainian power plant had been shelled. ""The point here is not that the father was anxious about Russian aggression; he was certainly not alone in that,"" said the judge. ""What troubles me is the impact this very plainly had on the mother."" The judge said: ""Having read and heard the accounts of both parties concerning the father's involvement with NAFO, I prefer on balance the mother's account that the father became obsessed and dedicated much time to this enterprise, at times drawing the children in."" He added: ""Even allowing for some exaggeration by the mother, this was a sufficient feature of family life that it was noticed by others.""

362,How much grain is Ukraine exporting and how is it leaving the country?,"Ukraine is exporting over five million tonnes of grain a month - much more than in the summer of 2023, when Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal. Russia stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine in July of that year, and as a result, the country's grain exports slumped. Ukraine exported 5.2 million tonnes of grain and maize in March, 5.8 million tonnes in February and 5.3 million tonnes in January. Before Russia's invasion in 2022, the country was sending about 6.5 million tonnes abroad every month . After Russia pulled of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (or ""grain deal""), it said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target. Few cargo ships dared to go to Ukrainian ports, and monthly grain exports fell to just over 2 million tonnes in July, August and September 2023 . However, Ukraine has since established new export routes. Between the end of the grain deal in July 2023 and the end of February 2024, it shipped about 20 million tonnes of grain to 42 countries , according to the country's vice prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov. This is despite 30 Russian attacks on Ukrainian grain ports and storage facilities since the deal ended. Before Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was the world's seventh largest exporter of wheat, fourth largest exporter of barley, and the biggest exporter of sunflower seeds (used for sunflower oil and feed). When the war started, Ukraine's exports slumped and world prices for grain soared . This particularly affected people in the world's poorest countries. The more grain that Ukraine has been able to supply to global markets, the lower prices have gone . Foodstuffs are a major earner for Ukraine. In 2021, the year before Russia's invasion, it made $27.8bn (£23.8bn) from exports . Under the grain deal, cargo ships travelled to and from Ukrainian ports along a 357-mile (574km) corridor across the Black Sea to the Bosphorus Strait. After that deal ended, Ukraine established a new ""temporary export corridor"" in August 2023, which hugs the western coastline. This is a relatively safe route for cargo ships because the waters there are too shallow for Russian submarines to operate . It also passes through the territorial waters of Romania and Bulgaria, two Nato countries. Under the EU's ""solidarity lanes"" scheme , Ukraine is also sending grain by land and barge to ports on the River Danube, or to the Romanian port of Constanta, to be loaded onto cargo ships which then travel through the Black Sea. More Ukrainian grain is also being exported to Europe to be sold on arrival, or to be shipped onwards from other European ports. Ukrainian armed forces have carried out repeated attacks on Russian naval ships and bases in the Black Sea, using aerial drones, sea drones and long-range missiles. Ukraine's navy claims it has hit or disabled a third of all the ships in Russia's Black Sea fleet since the war began. This has meant Russia is now putting fewer ships near the Ukrainian coast to blockade it . To help Ukraine's economy after the Russian invasion, the EU scrapped tariffs on imports from the country. However, countries in eastern Europe complained that this meant Ukrainian grain was flooding their markets, lowering wholesale prices and hitting the incomes of their farmers. Some dealers had decided to sell the grain in these countries rather than ship it overseas from other European ports. According to the EU's agriculture commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, 4.1 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain entered Poland between April 2022 and March 2023 , and 3.4 million tonnes of that stayed in the country. In May 2022, the European Commission introduced a ban on Ukrainian grain sales in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, only allowing grain meant for transit to enter those countries. It lifted the restrictions in September 2023, saying the problem had been solved. However, Poland has since imposed its own ban on Ukrainian grain imports, and Polish farmers have been blockading border crossings with Ukraine . In March 2024, the European Commission proposed a cap on duty-free imports of some Ukrainian produce , including oats, eggs, poultry and sugar. However it confirmed that all other Ukrainian imports into the EU - including wheat and barley - would remain free of duties until at least June 2025. It is also proposing to increase tariffs on imports of Russian and Belorusian grain to reduce surpluses in eastern European countries.",2024-04-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61759692,politics
363,Ukraine war: Deepest Ukraine drone attack into Russian territory injures 12,"Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a drone attack in Russia's Tatarstan region - more than 1,300km (807 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border. The strikes, in which 12 people were injured, are the deepest into Russian territory since the start of the war. Local authorities said that the strikes hit the town of Yelabuga, where drones are thought to be produced, and an oil refinery in nearby Nizhnekamsk. The attacks occurred around 05:45 local time (02:45 GMT). Yelabuga is located in the Alabuga ""special economic zone"" - an area with a special legal system aimed at attracting foreign investment. Iranian Shahed drones - which are frequently used by Russia to attack Ukraine - are thought to be assembled in Yelabuga. According to media reports, at least 12 people - all of them students - were injured in Yelabuga. Tatarstan regional leader Rustam Minnikhanov said the drones caused ""no serious"" damage to infrastructure in either location and that production operations were unaffected. However, Ukraine's military intelligence said the strike in Yelabuga ""caused significant destruction of production facilities"". Shortly after the attacks, a video circulated online purporting to show a light aircraft - thought to have been modified to fly unmanned - descending onto a building in Yelabuga before exploding, sending a fireball into the air. On Tuesday morning, drones were also spotted in the Lipetsk region south of Moscow and an air raid alert was introduced, local authorities said. For several months now, Kyiv has been ramping up its drone attacks on Russian territory. Ukraine has warned repeatedly that its army is facing severe ammunition shortages, but has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year. Earlier this year, Ukraine was reportedly able to hit a major gas export terminal near the city of St Petersburg , 1,250km (775 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border.",2024-04-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68712158,politics
364,Republican Speaker Johnson makes fresh push for Ukraine aid,"Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has a plan for getting new military assistance for Ukraine approved by Congress - and for keeping his tenuous hold on power. With Democrats wary and a Republican right flank eyeing open rebellion, however, Mr Johnson may find that even the best-laid plans could quickly unravel. The Louisiana congressman told Fox News he would push the House - which has the narrowest of Republican majorities - to structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans. To help cover the costs he suggested authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. ""If we can use the seized assets of Russian oligarchs to allow the Ukrainians to fight them, that's just pure poetry,"" said Mr Johnson. An estimated $300bn (£239bn) in Russian central bank assets have been frozen - although most of this is under European, not American, control. As an additional sweetener for his Republican colleagues, he also proposed tying the passage of Ukraine aid to legislation ending a hold on new liquefied natural gas export authorisations. The hold was imposed by the Biden administration in January at the behest of environmental activists. This wouldn't be the first time Republicans have tried to tie Ukraine assistance - which is opposed by a growing number of conservative voters and a small but vocal group of legislators - to an unrelated political priority for the party. In February, Senate Republicans negotiated with Democrats to construct a legislative package that included funding for Ukraine along with conservative immigration reforms and resources for border security. The deal collapsed, however, after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump voiced his opposition and his supporters in Congress - including Mr Johnson in the House - followed suit. The White House says approved Ukraine aid ran out at the beginning of the year and has repeatedly warned that the nation is losing ground in its war against Russia because of a lack of continued American backing. In the House of Representatives, pro-aid legislators have been gathering signatures for a parliamentary procedure that would trigger a vote on a Senate-approved measure that authorises new aid for Ukraine and Israel - essentially forcing Mr Johnson's hand. The House speaker's latest proposal may be a way to forestall such a direct erosion of his power to set the legislative agenda. As Mr Johnson grapples with how to help Ukraine, however, he stands on unstable ground. The man who assumed the speakership after his predecessor was ousted last year by a right-wing rebellion is facing similar unrest from his party's hard-core right. His negotiated deal with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown two weeks ago prompted one conservative firebrand, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to file a motion for his removal. While she has not taken steps to force a vote on the matter, she has warned that she will if Mr Johnson isn't ultimately replaced. Later this month, Republican membership in the House will drop to 217 - meaning it would only take two Republicans to join the chamber's 213 Democrats to launch an attempt to oust Mr Johnson. On Sunday night, Mr Johnson tried to reset expectations for his party - and buy himself some breathing room. ""We have the smallest majority, literally, right now in US history,"" he said. ""So we're not going to get the legislation that we all desire and prefer."" This mathematical reality puts the speaker in a delicate situation. If he angers even a handful of Republicans, such as by striking a deal to help Ukraine, it may trigger an uprising. And if he doesn't do enough to placate Democrats, they may once again help the rebellious conservatives execute their plot. With national elections to decide the presidency and control of both chambers of Congress set for November, Mr Johnson - and his fellow Republicans - can ill afford to appear rife with internal divisions and incapable of governing. ""This is not an easy job right now,"" Mr Johnson said.",2024-04-02,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68710298,politics
