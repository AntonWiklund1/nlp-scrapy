The members of the Arc de Seine Kayak club then sent what they had collected to be tested for bacterial levels. “My kayak capsized this morning and I’m OK,” a laughing Paul Maakad told NBC News on Sunday, at the Pont de Sevres in central Paris. But while Maakad, 40, and his fellow boaters said they were not scared of getting into the river, with less than 100 days to go before the 2024 Paris Olympics, fears are growing that events like the marathon swim, the triathlon and the paratriathlon could be postponed or canceled because of high pollution levels, or that the flotilla-based opening ceremony could be affected.Kayakers Paul Maakad, Sarah Birden and Vincent Darnet with the trash they collected from the Seine.Joel Lawrence / NBC NewsEarlier this month, Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris Organizing Committee, expressed confidence ""that it will be possible to use the Seine,” but admitted that the swimming leg of the triathlon could be canceled if pollution levels are too high. ""It’s what we want to avoid, of course,” he said. His comments came days after a French charity warned that bacteria, including “pollution of fecal origin,” was far higher in the river than permitted. As part of an ambitious plan to open up the Seine to public swimmers by 2025 — after being illegal for 100 years because of dangerously high pollution levels — France has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on altering and upgrading the city’s antiquated sewage system, which now includes a 13-million-gallon overflow tank called the Austerlitz Basin. But in August, the swim portion of the test marathon event was canceled because the river failed pollution tests.As the starting gun to the Games approaches, Fluidion, one of the companies the city of Paris contracted to monitor bacteria in the water, exclusively shared its findings with NBC News. Paul Maakad and Vincent Darnet are members of the Arc de Seine Kayak club.Joel Lawrence / NBC NewsA sample of water collected by the Pont Alexander III bridge, in the city’s center, showed E. coli levels two-and-a-half times the level considered safe for swimming. But that in itself isn’t necessarily a concern for the Games themselves, according to Dan Angelescu, the CEO of Fluidion, a tech company that develops water testing products. “In the summer when there is a lot of sunlight, when the water flow, river flow rate is really low, and when there is no rain for several weeks, let’s say two or three weeks without rain, you can actually reach really good water quality conditions,” he said in an interview this month.But he added that even a small rain event could make E. coli levels shoot up. “You may swim in very polluted water and nothing may happen to you, or you may swim and you may develop itches, or you may develop infections, or you may catch a strain of E. coli that may be pathogenic,"" he said. ""Those aren’t very common, but they exist, and that could get you really sick.”"
1,"In a first, London Marathon awards wheelchair and non-disabled athletes equal prize money",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/london-marathon-award-wheelchair-non-disabledd-athletes-equal-prize-mo-rcna148524,2024-04-20T12:31:40.000Z,"LONDON — In a global first for equality in sports, wheelchair athletes and non-disabled runners participating in the London Marathon on Sunday were competing for the exact same prize money.The move makes the event the only marathon in the world to award winners the same sum — $55,000 for first place, $30,000 for the runners-up and $22,500 for third-place finishers. Organizers said they were unaware of any other major athletic event in any sport that has taken a similar step.By equalizing the prize pot, marathon organizers have said they hope to pave the way for other races and sporting events to offer parity, encouraging more athletes to participate in disability sport and removing financial barriers to participation. The parity extends to gender: Both male and female wheelchair athletes are eligible for equal prize amounts.The men's wheelchair division race was won by Marcel Hug, a Paralympian widely considered the world’s best wheelchair racer, who cheered the decision ahead of the race.“The London Marathon is setting a great and strong but also courageous example for equality and inclusion that should go beyond the world of sport and hopefully inspires in other areas, too,” Hug told NBC News.Hug crossed the line in one hour, 28 minutes and 35 seconds in London to claim his fifth victory.American athlete Daniel Romanchuk placed second behind Hug. In third was British wheelchair racing star David Weir, a six-time Paralympic gold medalist who’s won the London race eight times before — more than any other athlete. Swiss athlete Catherine Debrunne won the women's event with a time of one hour, 3 minutes and 54 seconds. Manuela Schar, also from Switzerland came in second and American Tatyana McFadden placed third.Third place U.S. athlete Tatyana McFadden, winner Switzerland's Catherine Debrunner and second place Switzerland's Manuela Schar pose for a photo after the women's wheelchair race on Sunday.Justin Tallis / AFP via Getty ImagesIn Boston, the top prize for the wheelchair division was $40,000. In the open division, the non-disabled male and female winners took home $150,000 — more than three times as much.The 26.2-mile race in London kicked off Sunday morning south of the Thames River, crossing over Tower Bridge and passing iconic London landmarks like the Tower of London, the London Eye and the Big Ben before reaching the finish line near Buckingham Palace. Hugh Brasher, the London Marathon’s event director, cast the move as part of an evolution toward greater inclusion for athletes with disabilities that started in 1983 when the London race held its first wheelchair event, and continued with multiple International Paralympic Committee World Championships held since then in the British capital.Romanchuk, 25, who grew up in Maryland, applauded the decision to equalize the prize structure, predicting it would have “huge effects beyond race day.”“London Marathon’s equal prize money helps elevate perception of the sport to reflect the reality that we’re professional athletes, training and competing just like other professional athletes,” Romanchuk told NBC News as he traveled to London for the race. “My main hope is that it brings more visibility to the sport so that more athletes with disabilities can see the possibility of having an active lifestyle and participate in community running races.”Another reason why equalizing the financial aspect of sports is important, Romanchuk said, is that the high cost of specialized equipment for wheelchair racing often prevents lower-income athletes from getting involved. He said adaptive sports equipment starts at several thousands of dollars at entry level — far more than the pair of running shoes that a nondisabled athlete would need to start competing.Romanchuk said he’d first gotten involved in adaptive sports when he was 2 years old, describing the effect it had on his development and self-confidence.“They taught me to focus on what I did have — two strong arms — instead of what I didn’t have,” said Romanchuk, who was born with spina bifida, a congenital defect that affects the spinal cord. “The fact that my legs didn’t work normally was never an acceptable reason why I couldn’t reach a particular goal.”"
2,House advances Ukraine and Israel aid with rare support from more Democrats than Republicans,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-tees-votes-ukraine-israel-aid-speaker-johnson-defies-right-flank-rcna148550,2024-04-19T15:07:50.390Z,"WASHINGTON — The House voted 316-94 to tee up votes on four separate bills that include aid to Ukraine and Israel, a good sign for the prospects of Congress approving U.S. funding for the two countries after months of delay and partisan fighting.Speaker Mike Johnson, facing intense opposition from right-wing members, received crucial help from Democrats to move forward with the votes. More Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voted to pass the “rule,” a procedural step to set up the votes.The move tees up four House votes that are expected Saturday afternoon: one on Israel aid, another on Ukraine aid, another on Indo-Pacific security and a fourth bill that includes a bill designed to ban TikTok in the U.S. if it does not divest from its China-based owner, as well as various national security priorities. If they pass, the measures would be packaged together and sent to the Democratic-controlled Senate.Mike Johnson on April 17, 2024 in Washington, D.C.Kent Nishimura / Getty ImagesTaken together, the foreign aid measures closely resemble the $95 billion national security package pushed by President Joe Biden. The Senate would have to pass it again, due to some differences with the version that passed the upper chamber in February.""The world is watching what the Congress does. Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment,"" the White House budget office said in a statement Friday endorsing the House package. ""The Administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the President’s desk.""The House's move followed a vote of 9-3 in the Rules Committee late Thursday to send the bills to the floor for a final vote, with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., breaking with Johnson to vote against it. But all four Democrats on the committee voted for the rule and rescued it, an extremely unusual move for the minority party.""We only control one chamber, and I barely have control of that,"" Johnson said Thursday on Newsmax, explaining why he couldn't include GOP immigration measures in the package as some wanted. ""The Senate won't advance our legislation and the president won't sign it. ... I have a handful of my Republicans, at least, who will not advance a rule to bring that to the floor to combine it with the Ukraine and Israel funding. They won't do it. And so if I don’t have Republican votes, that means we have to have Democratic votes."" Johnson's decision to move forward with the bills comes as two of his members — Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — threaten to remove him as speaker. They and many other House conservatives oppose additional aid to Ukraine.“We’ll see what happens. I’m going to do my job. I’m not deterred by threats,” Johnson said Friday. “We’re going to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may.”But Johnson, who opposed Ukraine aid last year before he became speaker, now says he believes it is ""critically important,"" based on the intelligence and briefings he has since gotten.“I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,"" he told reporters this week.""I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,"" Johnson said, adding that his son is entering the Naval Academy this fall. ""This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.” The fourth bill includes a provision to force China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months, which the president can extend to a year, or face a ban in the U.S. The provision, which has Senate buy-in as well as Biden's support, puts TikTok closer than ever to a prohibition in the country.Democrats praised the move to proceed to House votes, highlighting their party's key role.""It is vital that Congress act to send assistance to support Ukraine and fend off Russian aggression,"" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said on X. ""We may be in the minority, but we are not going to let that urgent mission fail. Democrats are doing what it takes to make sure Ukraine gets help.""Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said Democrats were effectively in charge: ""We may be in the minority in the House right now, but @RepJeffries is essentially functioning as the real Speaker already. Rs couldn’t get their own bills out of the committee they control so Ds had to help them. Work horses not just show horses."""

The case is developing, they said.In Germany on Thursday, prosecutors said that two German-Russian men have been arrested on suspicion of espionage, one of them accused of agreeing to carry out attacks on potential targets including US military facilities in hopes of sabotaging aid for Ukraine.The two, identified only as Dieter S and Alexander J in line with German privacy rules, were arrested on Wednesday in the Bavarian city of Bayreuth, Germany’s federal prosecutors said.A number of people, including a dual Russian-Spanish citizen have been arrested in Poland on allegations of spying for Russia since Moscow launched its attack on Ukraine in February 2022.European Union member Poland has been a staunch supporter of neighboring Ukraine and Zelenskyy in fending off Russia’s aggression of more than two years."

The German Foreign Ministry confirmed that it summoned the Russian ambassador to Berlin on Thursday in light of the arrests.The Federal Criminal Police Office arrested the men Wednesday in Bayreuth, a city in the southern state of Bavaria.Bavarian state police searched their homes and workplaces. Some Ukrainian soldiers have been training at U.S. military installations in this part of Bavaria.Arrest warrants dated April 9 accuse both men of working for a foreign secret service, carrying out ""activity for sabotage purposes"" and obtaining ""security-threatening depictions of military installations,"" prosecutors said. The prosecutor's statement said Dieter S. has been in touch with a ""person who is connected to the Russian secret service"" since October, with whom he discussed possible sabotage operations in Germany. ""The actions were intended in particular to undermine military support provided to Ukraine from Germany against the Russian war of aggression,"" the statement said. ""Against this background, the accused stated to his counterpart that he was willing to use explosion and arson attacks especially on infrastructure used for military purposes and industrial sites in Germany,"" it added. ""To prepare, Dieter S. collected information about potential attack targets, including U.S. military facilities.""Authorities accused Dieter S. of going to multiple sites to take photos and videos that were passed on to his Russian secret service contact. They also allege that Alexander J. helped him from March this year at the latest.Dieter S. appeared Wednesday in court, where he was placed in pretrial detention. Alexander J will appear in court Thursday, authorities said.A separate arrest warrant dated April 11 accuses Dieter S. of membership in a foreign terrorist organization and of ""preparation of a serious act of violence that endangers the state."" The warrant notes the ""strong suspicion"" that he was active as a pro-Russian soldier in an armed wing of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, engaging in the ongoing war for control of Ukraine. Ukraine has long warned that Russian spies were active across Europe and working to sabotage its defense against Russia's invasion, in particular in Germany.Oleksiy Danilov, the former coordinator of Ukraine's war Cabinet, told The Times of London last month: ""We have made multiple warnings to our German partners about the spy network of Russians that are very active in Germany.""He added: ""It is well known the Russians are listening to conversations of German officials and we think this is not the last conversation they have.""Danilov was removed from his job and replaced last month as part of a military shake-up by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Germany accused Russia of ""information war"" last month after Russian state media published the audio of a private discussion among high-ranking German military officers about support for Ukraine, sparking embarrassment in Berlin and glee in Moscow.Germany has become the second-biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine after the U.S., but it has been engaged in a fierce debate over whether it should be doing more.“We know that the Russian power apparatus is also targeting our country,"" Justice Minister Marco Buschmann wrote on X after the arrests, adding that Germany “must respond to this threat defensively and decisively.”Germany’s top security official, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, said in a statement that this was ""a particularly serious case of suspected spy activity for Putin’s criminal regime.""Asked about the arrests Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""I can’t comment on it in any way. I do not have any information in this regard.”Carlo Angerer reported from Munich and Patrick Smith from London."

""The U.K. is my home and a place that I love. That will never change,"" he said in a speech soon after the announcement. ""We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride."" But a filing Wednesday from Travalyst Ltd, which the prince founded, showed that America is now his primary residence — at least for business purposes.The listing was added to Companies House, a government agency that lists public documents for privately owned businesses in Britain.Using his full name, Prince Henry Charles Albert David Duke Of Sussex, it said: ""New country/State Usually Resident: United States.""The London-based company, set up in April 2020, is 75% owned by the prince and describes itself as an adviser to the ""world's leading travel brands"" on sustainable tourism.Its most recent set of accounts, covering the year to June 30, 2023, show the company made a profit of £56,620 ($70,600).The change was filed this week, but it was made on June 29 last year, the day it was reported that Harry and Meghan had officially left Frogmore Cottage, a royal property near Windsor Castle west of London. Harry told a reporter in February that he had considered applying to become a U.S. citizen. Harry and Meghan have made headlines in recent years more for their media careers. His memoir, ""Spare,"" shot to the top of bestseller charts in the U.K. with its frank and detailed account of his early life, including losing his virginity in a field outside a country pub.The couple last week announced the latest productions as part of their multiyear contract with Netflix, a documentary series about polo and a lifestyle show focused on friendship and food.This week Meghan launched her own lifestyle brand by sending strawberry jam to influencers across the U.S. The jars were labeled ""American Riviera Orchard — Montecito,"" referring to the upmarket neighborhood of Santa Barbara, California, where the couple now live with their two children, Archie and Lilibet.Thursday also marks the first official royal engagement for Prince William, the heir to the throne, since his wife, Princess Kate, announced she was receiving treatment for cancer.The prince was due to visit community groups in west London and the neighboring area of Surrey to highlight efforts to reduce food waste as a way to feed people in need and reduce emissions that harm the environment."

The current minimum target is 2%.“They also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict with Israel in the Middle East, and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,” the campaign said.After their dinner Duda said it was “a friendly meeting in a very nice atmosphere.”Trump, who is on trial in New York over accusations that he covered up a “hush money” payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, is likely to face a tight race against President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November presidential election.Duda is in New York to attend the United Nations, and will travel on to Canada on Friday."
7,Prominent figure in German far-right party stands trial over alleged use of Nazi slogan,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/germany-far-right-leader-stands-trial-alleged-use-nazi-slogan-rcna148337,2024-04-18T09:58:36.709Z,"One of the most prominent figures in the far-right Alternative for Germany party arrived in court Thursday for his trial on charges of using a Nazi slogan, months before a regional election in which he is running to become his state’s governor.Björn Höcke, 52, is the leader of the regional branch of Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in the eastern state of Thuringia and a powerful figure on the party’s hard right.While never formally a national leader of AfD, the former history teacher has been consistently influential as the 11-year-old party has steadily headed further right and ousted several comparatively moderate leaders.At the trial at the state court in Halle, he is charged with using symbols of unconstitutional organizations. He is accused of ending a speech in nearby Merseburg in May 2021 with the words “Everything for Germany!”Prosecutors contend he was aware of the origin of the phrase as a slogan of the Nazis’ SA stormtroopers.Using symbols of unconstitutional organizations can carry a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years. Four court sessions have been scheduled through May 14.Demonstrators gathered outside the court building before the trial opened, with banners including “Björn Höcke is a Nazi” and “Stop AfD!” About 570 protesters turned out, according to police.The court last week added a second count of using the same phrase to the Halle trial, but decided shortly before proceedings started to try that separately because Höcke’s defense lawyers recently changed, German news agency dpa reported. In that case, prosecutors allege that he repeated the offense at a party event in Gera last December, “in certain knowledge of the punishability” of the slogan.They say that Höcke said “Everything for ...” and encouraged the audience to shout “Germany!”Höcke has led AfD’s regional branch in Thuringia since 2013, the year the party was founded, and its group in the state legislature in Erfurt since it first won seats there in 2014.He once called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a “monument of shame” and called for Germany to perform a “180-degree turn” in how it remembers its past. A party tribunal in 2018 rejected a bid to have him expelled.Höcke’s regional branch of AfD is now one of three that the domestic intelligence agency has under official surveillance as a “proven right-wing extremist” group.Wolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the Berlin Social Science Center, said Höcke has become an increasingly important figure in AfD and the front man of a “radicalization project” in the party. He said that people vote for the party “in part out of protest, in part out of conviction.”AfD is particularly strong in the formerly communist east and is in first place in polls in Thuringia ahead of a state election on Sept. 1, with recent surveys showing support of 29-to-31%.It’s unlikely that any other party will agree to work with Höcke and put him in the governor’s office, but AfD’s strength has made forming governing coalitions in the state enormously complicated.Höcke insisted in a debate with a conservative rival last week that he wasn’t aware “Everything for Germany!” was a Nazi slogan and claimed that many others have used it. “Everyone out there knows it’s an everyday saying,” he said on Welt television.He also faces a second trial, for which dates haven’t yet been set, on charges of incitement related to a 2022 post on Telegram about a crime in the western city of Ludwigshafen."
8,"House Republicans release aid bills for Israel and Ukraine, eyeing weekend House votes",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republican-aid-bills-ukraine-israel-rcna148025,2024-04-17T20:50:04.368Z,"WASHINGTON — Facing a divided party and pressure to act, House Speaker Mike Johnson rolled out three bills Wednesday to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, with the hope of holding final votes on Saturday.The bills represent a major test of Johnson’s ability to navigate a thicket of political and global challenges with a wafer-thin majority. And it comes as Johnson, R-La., faces a serious threat to his gavel from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.Johnson's biggest challenge is Ukraine funding, an issue that has bitterly divided the GOP. He has been squeezed by conservative security hawks who want to help Ukraine fend off Russia’s aggression and by an empowered isolationist wing that is feeding off former President Donald Trump’s criticism of NATO and prior Ukraine aid measures.Multiple Republicans say they oppose any funding for Ukraine, meaning that a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line. Many of the provisions in the bills resemble the package passed by the Senate in one bundle, which Johnson rejected and refused to put to a House vote.In a message to members before releasing the legislation, Johnson said there would be ""three bills that will fund America’s national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.""He said Republican leadership will come forward with an amendment process ""alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act,"" which is aimed at seizing Russian assets to benefit Ukraine; the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it divests from its China-based owner; as well as ""sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.""“We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening,” Johnson said in a text message obtained by NBC News.He said there will also be a ""border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2"" — a conservative, House-passed immigration bill — moving under a separate process. That measure serves as a sweetener for reticent conservatives who are unhappy that the aid bills don't include domestic immigration provisions.Swift conservative pushbackMultiple House conservatives pushed back immediately on social media Wednesday after Johnson's message went out, complaining that the border measures weren't directly tied to Ukraine funding.""The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid — while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the most recent chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said: ""Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to @SpeakerJohnson's own words just several weeks ago. Our constituents demand — and deserve — more from us.""Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, earlier called aid to Ukraine unnecessary, saying: “I’m not giving them a nickel today, tomorrow or next week.""“Putin is not going into Poland. I don’t care what you say. Besides, anyway, it doesn’t really matter because ... when Donald Trump wins, Putin’s leavin’. Putin’s leavin’ Ukraine,” Nehls said ahead of the bill’s release, without explaining his logic.House Democrats have repeatedly called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, calling it the best — if not only — path to getting a bill on Biden's desk. They have posted a ""discharge petition"" with 195 signatories to end-run Johnson and force a vote on that bill. It needs 218 votes to come up, meaning it will need the backing of some Republicans in addition to Democrats.At a Wednesday meeting with Democrats, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., told members that they need to use their “personal relationships” with Republicans to garner support for the discharge petition, according to two people familiar with her comments.Treasury Secretary Yellen dials up pressureAt a bilateral meeting later Wednesday with Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to dial up the pressure on House Republicans to act.“The failure of House Republicans to act to support Ukraine in this pivotal moment of the war for so long has been inexcusable—and detrimental to our national security,” Yellen will say, according to a Treasury source. “Every moment of delay by House Republicans strengthens Putin and emboldens America’s adversaries around the world who are closely watching to see if we, the United States, maintains its resolve to support a democratic Ukraine as it fends off an autocratic Russia.”Meanwhile, Greene has not said when she might force a vote on her ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair, which would take a simple majority to remove Johnson from his job. Her effort gained a cosponsor in Massie on Tuesday, who predicted Johnson would be voted out.It's not clear the votes are there to oust Johnson. Many conservatives, including some who voted to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have not joined the effort to oust Johnson. Some Democrats have also said they'll vote to protect Johnson from a motion to depose him.But Massie said that would only hurt his standing with the GOP in the long term.“Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans. He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he’ll lose 2 to 3 more Republicans,” Massie said. “He doesn’t have much shelf life after that.”Johnson struck a defiant tone Tuesday when asked about the threat to his gavel, calling it “absurd” while saying he’s “not concerned” about the motion and will continue to do his job."

The speaker did not mention a ban on TikTok, but other lawmakers leaving the meeting appeared to believe that could be included in the package. He indicated funding levels for the national security bills will be about the same as those proposed in the Senate supplemental aid package.Johnson said Ukraine aid was the most “controversial” piece in the GOP conference, but stressed that the majority of the bill would go toward replenishing American munitions — and therefore would be good for American jobs.“Every member ultimately will be able to vote their own conscience on all of these matters, and everyone have an opportunity to weigh in and bring the amendments that they think are suitable,” Johnson said. “We will follow the germaneness rules of the House of course and the regular rules with regard to amendments,” he added. “But I think the final product will be something that everybody can take confidence in because they got to vote their district and vote their conscience.”Johnson said he intends to allow members to read the text of the legislation for 72 hours before bringing the bills to the floor. If the text is released Tuesday, as Johnson said he hopes, that could mean the House might not vote on the four separate bills until Friday afternoon or evening. The House is currently scheduled to leave Thursday afternoon and be in recess next week, but that could change.Johnson said it was the will of the GOP conference to vote on the foreign aid pieces separately and that he would prefer to send each bill individually to the Senate, but no final decision has been made on whether to package them together.House Republicans had mixed reactions to Johnson’s plan, with many moderates expressing their support.“We need to get aid; I don’t care procedurally how we do it,” Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said.Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., called Johnson’s plan “thoughtful” and “an appropriate democratic process.”“It’s the right way in which the House should function, and quite frankly, I think America should see this,” Molinaro said.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said members were “excited” to hear they would get to vote this week and hopefully the House would pass the bills.Meanwhile, some on the far-right flank of Johnson’s caucus expressed opposition to his plan.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who filed a “motion to vacate” to oust Johnson, said she is “firmly against the plan” right now and that people would be angry about it. “I think it’s another wrong direction for Speaker Johnson,” she said. Greene added that she hasn’t decided whether to force a vote on her motion to remove Johnson, but said she doesn’t believe he will remain in the spot in the next Congress if the GOP maintains the majority.Johnson, for his part, said when asked whether he could survive a motion to vacate after bringing the bills to the floor that he doesn't  “spend my time worrying about motions to vacate.”Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., argued that if the House passes the supplemental bills that Johnson proposed, it should wait to transmit them until the Senate takes up bills focused on energy and the border.“It doesn’t make for a really precise soundbite, but there is a legislative mechanism by which we can take up these votes but then not transmit the bills until the Senate takes some action,” Gaetz said. “That’s a way to leverage the Senate into taking action on our drilling agenda and on our border agenda.”House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., said he supports Johnson’s plan for separate aid bills but said GOP leadership will be “terribly disappointed” if border security isn’t tied into the supplemental aid.“Republican leadership promised that we would utilize the supplemental process to fight for border security,” Good said. “So I think they’re going to be terribly disappointed if we don’t do that.”Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., also warned that he would walk back his support on Johnson’s supplemental if it lacks border security provisions.“Border security is the No. 1 issue in the country. And for this town to be totally focused on Ukraine while they continue to ignore our southern border is atrocious, and it’s a slap in the face of the American people,” Donalds said."
11,"From Sin City to the City of Angels, building starts on high-speed rail line",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sin-city-city-angels-building-starts-high-speed-rail-line-rcna148753,2024-04-22T09:20:11.593Z,"Work is set to begin Monday on a $12 billion high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area, with officials projecting millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding trains by 2028.Brightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 218 miles of new track between a terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip and another new facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Almost the full distance is to be built in the median of Interstate 15, with a station stop in San Bernardino County’s Victorville area.In a statement, Brightline Holdings founder and Chairperson Wes Edens called the moment “the foundation for a new industry.”Brightline aims to link other U.S. cities that are too near to each other for flying between them to make sense and too far for people to drive the distance, Edens said.CEO Mike Reininger has said the goal is to have trains operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to take part in Monday’s groundbreaking. Brightline received $6.5 billion in backing from the Biden administration, including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure funds and approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar bonds.The project is touted as the first true high-speed passenger rail line in the nation, designed to reach speeds of 186 mph comparable to Japan’s Shinkansen bullet trains.The route between Vegas and L.A. is largely open space, with no convenient alternate to I-15. Brightline’s Southern California terminal will be at a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles.The project outline says electric-powered trains will cut the four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours. Forecasts are for 11 million one-way passengers per year, or some 30,000 per day, with fares well below airline travel costs. The trains will offer rest rooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check luggage.Las Vegas is a popular driving destination for Southern Californians. Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where motorists often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home from a Las Vegas weekend.The Las Vegas area, now approaching 3 million residents, draws more than 40 million visitors per year. Passenger traffic at the city’s Harry Reid International Airport set a record of 57.6 million people in 2023. An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data.Florida-based Brightline Holdings already operates the Miami-to-Orlando line with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph. It launched service in 2018 and expanded service to Orlando International Airport last September. It offers 16 round-trips per day, with one-way tickets for the 235-mile distance costing about $80.Other fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak’s Acela, which can top 150 mph while sharing tracks with freight and commuter service between Boston and Washington, D.C.Ideas for connecting other U.S. cities with high-speed passenger trains have been floated in recent years, including Dallas to Houston; Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago to St. Louis. Most have faced delays.In California, voters in 2008 approved a proposed 500-mile rail line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the plan has been beset by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than tripled to $105 billion."

It’s always fun surfing against John — we’re going to have many more heats together,” said Robinson, who missed the event last year due to injury.The world tour next heads to the thumping tubes of Teahupo’o in Tahiti, where both Robinson and Florence will be among the favourites battling for Olympic gold in just a few months time.Florence earlier scored the only perfect 10 of the event in his semi-final against Australian wildcard George Pittar, blowing his tail out and holding onto his board with the toenails of one foot before recovering for a couple more turns.Gabriela Bryan of Hawaii after winning the final round at the Western Australia Margaret River Pro on Sunday.Beatriz Ryder / World Surf League via Getty ImagesBoth Bryan, 22, and 18-year-old Lindblad had to go deep at Margaret River to avoid the mid-season cut and secure their place for the remainder of the 2024 tour.Lindblad went into the final in top form, having dispatched two-time world champion Tyler Wright in their semi-final to secure her place above the cut line.Bryan took a commanding lead with a 7.83 for two powerful turns on her forehand as a handful of dolphins swooped around her.“When I kicked out, I was just wow! That wave was sent to me by someone, the dolphins in it. It was magical,” said Bryan, who scored an even better 8.10 on her second scoring ride.“I’m just so happy we got good waves today and all the girls put on a really good show. It’s insane, I just won!”Both the men’s and women’s field will now be cut for the final four events of the world tour, with 11-time world champion Kelly Slater and Australian veteran Sally Fitzgibbons among those missing out."

15,"Terry Anderson, AP reporter kidnapped in Lebanon and held captive for years, dies at 76",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/obituaries/terry-anderson-ap-reporter-kidnapped-lebanon-held-captive-years-dies-7-rcna148731,2024-04-21T22:21:38.746Z,"LOS ANGELES — Terry Anderson, the globe-trotting Associated Press correspondent who became one of America’s longest-held hostages after he was snatched from a street in war-torn Lebanon in 1985 and held for nearly seven years, has died at 76.Anderson, who chronicled his abduction and torturous imprisonment by Islamic militants in his best-selling 1993 memoir “Den of Lions,” died on Sunday in at his home in Greenwood Lake, New York, said his daughter, Sulome Anderson.The cause of death was unknown, though his daughter said Anderson recently had heart surgery.After returning to the United States in 1991, Anderson led a peripatetic life, giving public speeches, teaching journalism at several prominent universities and, at various times, operating a blues bar, Cajun restaurant, horse ranch and gourmet restaurant.He also struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, won millions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets after a federal court concluded that country played a role in his capture, then lost most of it to bad investments. He filed for bankruptcy in 2009.Upon retiring from the University of Florida in 2015, Anderson settled on a small horse farm in a quiet, rural section of northern Virginia he had discovered while camping with friends. `“I live in the country and it’s reasonably good weather and quiet out here and a nice place, so I’m doing all right,” he said with a chuckle during a 2018 interview with The Associated Press.In 1985 he became one of several Westerners abducted by members of the Shia Muslim group Hezbollah during a time of war that had plunged Lebanon into chaos.After his release, he returned to a hero’s welcome at AP’s New York headquarters.As the AP’s chief Middle East correspondent, Anderson had been reporting for several years on the rising violence gripping Lebanon as the country fought a war with Israel, while Iran funded militant groups trying to topple its government.On March 16, 1985, a day off, he had taken a break to play tennis with former AP photographer Don Mell and was dropping Mell off at his home when gun-toting kidnappers dragged him from his car.He was likely targeted, he said, because he was one of the few Westerners still in Lebanon and because his role as a journalist aroused suspicion among members of Hezbollah.“Because in their terms, people who go around asking questions in awkward and dangerous places have to be spies,“ he told the Virginia newspaper The Review of Orange County in 2018.What followed was nearly seven years of brutality during which he was beaten, chained to a wall, threatened with death, often had guns held to his head and often was kept in solitary confinement for long periods of time.Anderson was the longest held of several Western hostages Hezbollah abducted over the years, including Terry Waite, the former envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had arrived to try to negotiate his release.By his and other hostages’ accounts, he was also their most hostile prisoner, constantly demanding better food and treatment, arguing religion and politics with his captors, and teaching other hostages sign language and where to hide messages so they could communicate privately.He managed to retain a quick wit and biting sense of humor during his long ordeal. On his last day in Beirut he called the leader of his kidnappers into his room to tell him he’d just heard an erroneous radio report saying he’d been freed and was in Syria.“I said, ‘Mahmound, listen to this, I’m not here. I’m gone, babes. I’m on my way to Damascus.’ And we both laughed,” he told Giovanna DellÓrto, author of “AP Foreign Correspondents in Action: World War II to the Present.”He learned later his release was delayed when a third party who his kidnappers planned to turn him over to left for a tryst with his mistress and they had to find someone else.Anderson’s humor often hid the PTSD he acknowledged suffering for years afterward.“The AP got a couple of British experts in hostage decompression, clinical psychiatrists, to counsel my wife and myself and they were very useful,” he said in 2018. “But one of the problems I had was I did not recognize sufficiently the damage that had been done.“So, when people ask me, you know, ‘Are you over it?’ Well, I don’t know. No, not really. It’s there. I don’t think about it much these days, it’s not central to my life. But it’s there.”At the time of his abduction, Anderson was engaged to be married and his future wife was six months pregnant with their daughter, Sulome.The couple married soon after his release but divorced a few years later, and although they remained on friendly terms Anderson and his daughter were estranged for years.“I love my dad very much. My dad has always loved me. I just didn’t know that because he wasn’t able to show it to me.,” Sulome Anderson told the AP in 2017.Father and daughter reconciled after the publication of her critically acclaimed 2017 book, “The Hostage’s Daughter,” in which she told of traveling to Lebanon to confront and eventually forgive one of her father’s kidnappers.Terry Anderson arrives to a festive welcome at Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va., on Dec. 12, 1991.Barry Thumma / AP“I think she did some extraordinary things, went on a very difficult personal journey, but also accomplished a pretty important piece of journalism doing it,” Anderson said. “She’s now a better journalist than I ever was.”Terry Alan Anderson was born Oct. 27, 1947. He spent his early childhood years in the small Lake Erie town of Vermillion, Ohio, where his father was a police officer.After graduating from high school, he turned down a scholarship to the University of Michigan in favor of enlisting in the Marines, where he rose to the rank of staff sergeant while seeing combat during the Vietnam War.After returning home, he enrolled at Iowa State University where he graduated with a double major in journalism and political science and soon after went to work for the AP. He reported from Kentucky, Japan and South Africa before arriving in Lebanon in 1982, just as the country was descending into chaos.“Actually, it was the most fascinating job I’ve ever had in my life,” he told The Review. “It was intense. War’s going on — it was very dangerous in Beirut. Vicious civil war, and I lasted about three years before I got kidnapped.”Anderson was married and divorced three times. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by another daughter, Gabrielle Anderson, from his first marriage."

17,Iran’s supreme leader tacitly acknowledges Tehran hit little in its attack on Israel,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/irans-supreme-leader-tacitly-acknowledges-tehran-hit-little-attack-isr-rcna148718,2024-04-21T17:37:43.625Z,"JERUSALEM — Iran’s supreme leader on Sunday dismissed any discussion of whether Tehran’s unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel hit anything there, a tacit acknowledgment that despite launching a major assault, few projectiles actually made it through to their targets.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments before senior military leaders didn’t touch on the apparent Israeli retaliatory strike on Friday on the central city of Isfahan, even though air defenses opened fire and Iran grounded commercial flights across much of the country.Analysts believe both Iran and Israel, regional archrivals locked in a shadow war for years, are trying to dial back tensions following a series of escalatory attacks between them as the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip rages on and inflames the wider region.Khamenei, 85, made the comments in a meeting attended by the top ranks of Iran’s regular military, police and paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a powerful force within its Shiite theocracy.“Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn’t, these are of secondary importance,” Khamenei said in remarks aired by state television.“The main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation and Iranian military’s will in an important international arena. This is what matters.”Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles that sought to overwhelm Israel’s air defenses in the April 13 attack — the first on Israel by a foreign power since Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launched Scud missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War.However, Israeli air defenses and fighter jets, backed by the U.S., the United Kingdom and neighboring Jordan, shot down the vast majority of the incoming fire.Satellite images analyzed Saturday by The Associated Press showed the Iranian attack caused only minor damage at the Nevatim air base in southern Israel, including taking a chunk out of a taxiway that Israel quickly repaired.Iran’s attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on April 1 targeting a consular building next to the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria, which killed two Guard generals and others.“Today, thanks to the work done by our armed forces, the Revolutionary Guard, the army, the police, each in its own way, praise be to Allah the image of the country around the world has become commendable,” added Khamenei, despite Iran facing public anger over its economy and crackdowns on dissent."
18,Public school enrollment in the U.S. slipping as alternatives gain support,https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/public-school-enrollment-us-states-map-chart-rcna119262,2024-04-21T12:30:41.000Z,"More and more, parents are opting America’s children out of public school.The share of children ages 5 to 17 enrolled in public schools fell by almost 4 percentage points from 2012 to 2022, an NBC News analysis of Census Bureau data found, even as the overall population grew.NBC News’ analysis found:87.0% of children were enrolled in public school in 2022, compared to 90.7% in 2012.In Kentucky, the share of school-age children in public schools decreased by almost 8 percentage points. In South Carolina, the share of children enrolled in public schools decreased by 7.4 percentage points. In Alaska, enrollment decreased by nearly 7 percentage points.During the same period, the share of 5 to 17 year-olds enrolled in private schools increased by 2 percentage points, the Census Bureau data showed. Charter schools saw a similar increase, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, a nonprofit group dedicated to advancing charter schools. Educators and researchers say the swing has been caused in part by laws that have targeted public schools while propping up alternatives. “[The rise in charter schools] is a thread of the larger campaign of privatization,” said Abbie Cohen, a Ph.D. candidate in UCLA’s School of Education and Information Studies. “Those two things are happening at the same time, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence.” Policies that make private, charter and homeschooling options more available to families — dubbed “school choice” by advocates — have expanded rapidly since 2022. Such policies grant families public funds for alternative schooling in the form of vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, refundable tax credits and more. In 2023, at least 146 school choice bills were introduced across 43 states, according to FutureEd, an education-focused think tank at Georgetown University. Nineteen school choice laws were enacted last year in 17 states, including South Carolina and Florida, which have seen some of the most dramatic declines of students enrolled in public schools. As part of the push for school choice, states are eliminating income limits and other eligibility requirements, allowing higher-income families to receive benefits. Eight states passed such laws or created such programs in 2023, FutureEd’s data shows, bringing the total number of states with these programs — commonly referred to as  “universal school choice” — to 10.Though Kentucky has seen the most students leave public schools, it is one of 18 states without a school choice program, and the state doesn’t fund charters. Homeschooling and “microschooling,” where students are homeschooled together and may be supervised by someone other than their own parents, are increasingly popular alternatives. An EdChoice/Morning Consult poll reported that 15% of parents in Kentucky prefer homeschooling, compared to 9% of parents nationwide. Robert Enlow, the CEO of the nonprofit school choice advocacy group EdChoice, said he is “agnostic” to which options are chosen, but believes the money should follow each student wherever they go. “Families are saying, ‘Let me have the resources that are due to me, that I get through taxes that are set aside for my kid, and then let me choose,’” Enlow said.At the same time that states are pushing school choice programs, public schools — already dealing with declining enrollment — have faced budget cuts, teacher shortages, and laws and fights over what is taught in the classroom. More than 20 states have considered bills since 2022 that would give parents more control over the curriculum in public schools, from granting parents access to course materials prior to classes, to banning instruction on sexual orientation and gender and allowing parents to opt their children out of any classes. One state that has pushed such laws is Florida. The state has passed several parent rights laws since 2020, including changes to make it easier for parents to ban books from classes, a ban against discussing sexuality and gender identity in younger grades and a ban on teaching critical race theory in classes.Florida’s 5 to 17-year-old population has grown 9% since 2012, but NBC News’ analysis found that  its public school enrollment fell 7% during that span.Andrew Spar, the president of the Florida Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, said new laws have unclear directions and handcuff teachers’ ability to instruct without fear of retaliation for what’s discussed in class. “In Florida, there’s so much micromanaging of our public schools, so many bureaucratic rules and laws that get in the way, that it becomes increasingly difficult for us to do our jobs,” Spar said. “Teachers are vilified; they can’t do their jobs.”Cohen, from UCLA, said parents are unenrolling students from public schools when they either feel the curriculum is not teaching accurate history, or hope for more conservative changes in school policies and curricula. Her research found that funding cuts are among the policies “fueling mistrust” in public schools and could be leading families to alternatives. The states with the largest declines in public school enrollment also have the lowest per-pupil spending, Census Bureau data shows. Educators and researchers question whether public schools will bounce back from recent enrollment declines as districts experience a wave of financial struggles and closures. “Who is hurting the most are the students who have been most historically marginalized in society,” Cohen said. “When more kids are leaving the public schools, that’s less funding for the public schools and those who are left, are left with less.”"
19,University of Idaho murder suspect's alibi defense puts spotlight on cellphone data analyst,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/university-idaho-murder-suspects-alibi-defense-puts-spotlight-cellphon-rcna148405,2024-04-21T11:00:40.000Z,"When Bryan Kohberger’s lawyers filed an updated alibi defense last week, suggesting cellphone tower data will show the man suspected in the slayings of four University of Idaho students was not in the area of the crime scene when they were killed, they said they planned to turn to an Arizona-based cell data analyst for key testimony.It wouldn’t be the first time that Sy Ray has been asked to be an expert witness in a high-profile murder trial, although he said Friday that, out of the more than 100 times he’s testified in state and federal cases, it has typically been for the prosecution.Now, Ray’s involvement in the case of the four college students fatally stabbed in their off-campus apartment house in November 2022, which continues to stir speculation over why someone would commit the gruesome act, is putting a spotlight on his expertise after past scrutiny over his credentials.A timeline of the Idaho stabbingsRay declined to address the Kohberger case, as a judge issued a gag order last year preventing many involved from speaking publicly, but he said in general that it takes “competent experts with adequate experience to interpret call detail records.”“Where the challenges come in is when there’s a different level of experience,” he added, “and some of these records can be extremely complicated.”Ray, a former Gilbert, Arizona, police detective, founded ZetX Corp., a company specializing in cellular geolocation mapping, in 2014. In the courtroom, Ray has found himself and his mapping software, Trax, under questions about reliability before.“I’ve seen in previous cases where his credibility has been brought into question,” said Mark Pfoff, a cellular technology expert and former sheriff’s detective in El Paso County, Colorado.Pfoff testified for the defense in a 2022 hearing related to the case of a man accused of stalking an ex-girlfriend. But the judge barred prosecutors from using Ray’s software data.District Court Judge Juan Villaseñor ruled that ZetX’s Trax mapping was inadmissible and based on a “sea of unreliability” after other experts found the technology to be problematic.“For one, the Court doesn’t find Ray credible,” Villaseñor wrote, adding: “He inflated his credentials, inaccurately claiming to be an engineer.” He went on to say that Ray has “no qualifications, licenses, or credentials to support” calling himself an engineer and that there’s “no evidence that Ray’s taken any engineering classes.”Police tape surrounds the home where four University of Idaho students were found dead in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13, 2022.Ted S. Warren / AP fileVillaseñor also took exception with how the Trax algorithm wasn’t open to “scientific scrutiny.”“While Ray stands by his formula, it hasn’t gained traction in the scientific community,” the judge wrote. “The methodology and algorithm aren’t published or subject to peer review, and they’ve been routinely labeled as junk science by the relevant scientific community.”Ray said on Friday that he agreed with the defense in that there was inaccuracy with the data, but the case was an anomaly. NBC News found other cases, including in Pennsylvania and Michigan, in which Ray’s credibility and data were questioned in hearings, but judges ultimately deemed them admissible.“I absolutely stand by the product,” Ray said.He added that the Colorado judge denigrated his background unfairly and that he was misquoted and misinterpreted about discussing how he and engineers interpret call records. He said he has gone into the field to research how a cellphone will connect to certain cell sites, which an engineer would not need to do.“In a way, I’m doing something the engineers don’t do to figure out how to do this better,” he said Friday, adding that the Trax software is “testable” by others.It’s unclear how many law enforcement agencies currently use Trax, but Ray in 2022 said he provided training to more than 8,000 law enforcement officers, prosecutors and defense experts. LexisNexis purchased ZetX in 2021. The data analytics company said in a statement that it is “proud to support a broad range of law enforcement agencies,” but does not disclose customer information.According to a background of Ray’s experience filed in court documents by Kohberger’s defense team, he ended his role as a director for LexisNexis Special Services last year.He has also appeared on various true crime television shows, including NBC’s “Dateline,” and hosts a true crime podcast with his wife, “Socialite Crime Club,” in which they “discuss their involvement in criminal cases from around the world and what it takes to solve complex investigations.”Idaho alibiIn a 10-page filing Wednesday signed by Anne Taylor, Kohberger’s lead public defender, his lawyers said they would call on Ray to help corroborate their client’s alibi.At the time of the slayings, Kohberger was a doctoral student at Washington State University and living in Pullman, Washington, about 10 miles west of Moscow, Idaho, where the University of Idaho is located.In an affidavit following Kohberger’s arrest weeks after the killings, prosecutors said he was linked to the scene through male DNA discovered on a knife sheath left at the victims’ apartment house.In addition, investigators said, they tracked Kohberger in the area of the home through his cellphone use and surveillance that picked up a Hyundai Elantra that they believed he was driving.Kohberher’s alibi defense said he would go for nighttime drives, and that those only increased during the school year.“This is supported by data from Mr. Kohberger’s phone showing him in the countryside late at night and/or in the early morning on several occasions,” they wrote. “The phone data includes numerous photographs taken on several different late evenings and early mornings, including in November, depicting the night sky.”From top left, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle.In the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022, when Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kernodle’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20, were killed, Kohberger “was out driving” in an area south of Pullman and west of Moscow.But, the defense team added, Ray’s testimony intends to show that “Kohberger’s mobile device did not travel east on the Moscow-Pullman Highway in the early morning hours of November 13th, and thus could not be the vehicle captured on video along the Moscow-Pullman highway near Floyd’s Cannabis shop.”They said that Ray would be able to share further analysis that would be based on discovery provided by the prosecution, but if such information is “not disclosed, Mr. Ray’s testimony will also reveal that critical exculpatory evidence, further corroborating Mr. Kohberger’s alibi, was either not preserved or has been withheld.”Prosecutors had said in its affidavit that a search warrant provided Kohberger’s cellphone data for the 24 hours before and after the incident, and it showed that he left his home two hours before the killings and then turned his phone off, only to turn it on again afterward, when it was seen traveling from Idaho to Pullman.Bryan Kohberger listens to arguments at a hearing in Moscow, Idaho, on Oct. 26.Kai Eiselein / New York Post pool via AP fileA grand jury last May indicted Kohberger on four counts of murder and burglary, and a judge entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.A trial was expected to begin last October, but has been delayed, with a change of venue hearing scheduled for June 27.Cellphone analysisWhile further detail about how Ray would support the defense’s alibi claim is unclear, the use of such cellphone mapping technology and forensics has become a sought-after capability in legal proceedings, experts say, as prosecutors attempt to prove a defendant was at the scene of a crime. Defense teams as well may bring on their own experts to refute law enforcement’s analysis.Kevin Horan, a retired FBI agent and co-founder of Precision Cellular Analysis, an Ohio-based firm that consults in legal cases, said mapping software generally works the same: It matches cell site information, known as call detail records, with a list of cell towers, and plots it onto a map.He said analysts can determine from which side, or sector, of a cell tower a cellphone utilized. In criminal cases, he added, investigators can use that information to analyze whether the phone was in a certain vicinity of where the crime happened.“Ultimately the question of where the phone was during the date and time in question is answered by the jury, who must decide based on all available evidence if the defendant and his phone were at the crime scene,” Horan said. “Cellphone evidence like this simply helps the jury draw these types of conclusions. A properly trained cellphone expert will never testify that, based on the cell data, the defendant or his phone were at a crime scene.”Horan said Ray’s Trax mapping software has stood out from other programs because it includes an estimated coverage area of a cell site, which he finds “highly problematic and misleading,” and that only a “drive test” in which scanning gear is used can help determine a cell site’s full coverage area.Ray said the company he founded has a database in which every cell site in the U.S. — hundreds of thousands — have been mapped, updated over time and archived.“We’ve been drive-testing since 2014, and every drive test we do, we archive,” Ray said. “Nobody will ever be able to drive-test every cell site. It’s an impossible task.”Horan said in general it’s imperative for the data collected to be accurate and interpreted correctly.“People’s lives, their liberty, is on the line, and we certainly don’t want to convict someone who’s innocent or use evidence that’s questionable and could come back at a later time,” he said."

The country’s top priority, he said, is “securing food for all Zimbabweans. No Zimbabwean must succumb to, or die from hunger.”He appealed to United Nations agencies, local businesses and faith organizations to contribute towards humanitarian assistance.El Nino, a naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world’s weather. In southern Africa, it typically causes below-average rainfall, but this year has seen the worst drought in decades.In Zimbabwe, the United Nations’ World Food Program has already rolled out a food assistance program targeting the 2.7 million people, nearly 20 percent of the country’s population, from January to March.Women share peas during a food aid distribution in Mangwe  southwestern Zimbabwe last month.Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi / APThe first few months of the year are traditionally known as the “lean period,” when households run short as they wait for the new harvest. However, there is little hope for replenishing food stores this year, and Mnangagwa said that even more people than previously forecast will likely need food aid.More than 60% of Zimbabwe’s 15 million people live in rural areas, growing the food they eat, and sometimes small surpluses that can be sold to cover expenses such as school fees. With relatively little participation in the cash economy, many of those won’t be able to buy food even when it’s available in markets.Zimbabwe, once a regional agricultural powerhouse and grain exporter, has in recent years relied more and more on aid agencies to avert mass hunger due to extreme weather conditions such as heat waves and floods.Mnangagwa’s declaration will open the way for aid agencies to mobilize international support for more aid, but many people may still fail to get assistance, which is likely to be targeted to the most vulnerable populations due to limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by rich governments.Much of Southern Africa is in the throes of a food crisis due to the ongoing drought. Zimbabwe declared a state of national disaster and appealed for humanitarian assistance from international donors in 2019, after a failed crop left tens of thousands in need.Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the current drought a national disaster in February, saying that almost half of his country’s staple corn crop had been destroyed. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than 6 million in Zambia, half of them children, have been affected by the drought.Less than a month later, Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera said his country needed more than $200 million in urgent humanitarian assistance over a drought that he said has affected 2 million households in 23 of the tiny country’s 28 districts. The U.N. Children’s Fund said about 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government’s foreign aid agency, has estimated through its Famine Early Warning Systems Network that 20 million people in southern Africa needed food relief between January and March.These needs could extend into early 2025 for many people in areas of highest concern such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar due to El Nino, USAID said."

Conversely, the law has broad support among the country’s population.  The law allows the death penalty in cases of “aggravated homosexuality,” which it defines as cases of same-sex relations involving a minor and other categories of vulnerable people, or when one of the individuals has HIV. A suspect convicted of “attempted aggravated homosexuality” can be imprisoned for up to 14 years, and the offense of “attempted homosexuality” is punishable by up to 10 years.Homosexuality was already illegal in Uganda under a colonial-era law criminalizing sexual activity “against the order of nature.” The punishment for that offense remains life imprisonment.More than 60 countries — mostly in Africa and the Mideast — have criminalized homosexuality, according to Human Rights Watch, but Uganda’s anti-gay law is considered one of the harshest. The Biden administration sanctioned the Ugandan government and restricted visas of Uganda officials following the law’s passage last year. Uganda’s government then accused the United States of pushing an “LGBT agenda.”Mugisha said the U.S. needs to do more.“The U.S. government has got a very good relationship with Uganda,” Mugisha said. “I think there are so many bilateral relationships that they can engage in. It could be behind the scenes advocacy, it could be public advocacy, but they should engage more.”Ugandan officials deliver a judgment on the consolidated petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Anti-Homosexuality Act in Kampala on Wednesday.Badru Katumba / AFP - Getty ImagesMugisha said he is worried about going back to his home country and facing what he described as “violence that would come from the state.” “I am petrified,” he said. “If the judges can give such a ruling, that means there is no protection for any LGBTQ person in Uganda, and I’m not immune to that.”“Uganda is ground zero for homophobia,” he added.For more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter."
24,Eight passengers stranded on African island after Norwegian cruise ship left without them,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/eight-passengers-stranded-african-island-norwegian-cruise-ship-left-rcna145984,2024-04-03T15:41:06.494Z,"A dream cruise vacation has turned into a nightmare for eight passengers left stranded on the African island of São Tomé and Príncipe after their ship left without them because they were late to return from a private tour. The tourists — six from the U.S. and two from Australia — were aboard the Norwegian Dawn, a Norwegian cruise line ship, which departed from Cape Town, South Africa, on March 20 for a 21-day voyage up the coast of Africa set to end in Barcelona, Spain, on April 10. But on Wednesday, the group of eight tourists was late to return to the ship by more than an hour for the all-aboard time of 3 p.m. from a private excursion on the island, which was not organized by the cruise line.Jay and Jill Campbell of South Carolina were part of the group that was left behind. They said that their tour’s operator notified the cruise captain that they were going to be late to rejoin the ship and that the local Coast Guard tried to get them on the vessel but that they weren’t allowed to board. As a result, the couple and the rest of the group have been stranded for days on the island off Nigeria, grappling with language, currency issues and complicated travel to catch up with the ship. “The lovely people of São Tomé were very gracious, very hospitable. They had reached out as much as they could to help us find hotels,” Jay Campbell said on NBC's ""TODAY"" show Tuesday morning. “We were able to get to a tour agency there to arrange flights to the next port of call. ... Very difficult process — you’re dealing with multiple languages, language barriers, you’re dealing with different currencies ... finding someone that even has dollars ... trying to get an agent to understand where we need to get to. ""It’s one of those ‘You can’t get there from here,’"" he added. A Norwegian spokesperson called the incident a “very unfortunate situation” and said, “Guests are responsible for ensuring they return to the ship at the published time.”The cruise line said that after the guests failed to return, their passports were delivered to local port agents, in line with protocol. The company said it was working with local authorities to understand “the requirements and visas needed for the guests to reboard the ship at the next available port of call.”On Monday, the guests had made arrangements to rejoin the ship in Banjul, Gambia, but the ship was unable to safely dock there because of “adverse weather conditions” and “tidal restrictions,” Norwegian said. The guests were then contacted and provided with information to rejoin the ship at Dakar, Senegal, on Tuesday. Jill Campbell said they traveled through seven countries in 48 hours to arrive in Senegal on Monday night. But the couple was reconsidering whether they even wanted to return to the cruise.""We are considering whether or not we are going to board the ship. It is in dock here in Senegal,"" she said. ""We believe there was a basic duty of care that they had forgotten about, so it does concern us.""""After what we witnessed, we truly believe that although there’s a set of rules or policies that the ship may have followed, they followed those rules too rigidly. I believe that they really forgot that they are people working in the hospitality industry and really the safety and well-being of the customers should be their first priority,"" she added. Ultimately, the eight passengers did rejoin the cruise before 8:30 a.m. ET Tuesday in Dakar, Senegal, Norwegian told NBC News in an e-mail Tuesday evening, after this story originally published. Norwegian said the passengers were responsible for making their own travel arrangements to rejoin the ship. ""Despite the series of unfortunate events outside of our control, we will be reimbursing these eight guests for their travel costs from Banjur, Gambia to Dakar, Senegal,"" a cruise line spokesperson said in a statement. ""We remain in communication with the guests and are providing additional information as it becomes available.""A silver lining of the catastrophe was that the Campbells were able to connect with another Norwegian Dawn passenger — Julia Lenkoff, 80 — who was also left on the island, but for a medical reason. Lenkoff was on a different day tour Wednesday. She had ""medically disembarked"" from the cruise to seek local treatment on that day, Norwegian said.Norwegian said that its care team tried to call Lenkoff several times and was unable to reach her and that it worked with its port agent in São Tomé and Príncipe for updates on her health. The Campbells met Lenkoff and were able to put her in contact with her family in California, who flew her home — a move Lenkoff's daughter said ""saved her life.""""She's a world traveler. She travels all the time. So this was going to be one of her bucket list trips, because she's been to 120 countries so far, and she wanted to get to 130,"" her daughter, Lana Lenkoff Geis, said in an interview that aired Tuesday on ""TODAY."" Norwegian said Lenkoff was escorted on a flight to Lisbon, Portugal, then put in the care of airport staff members to continue her journey back to the U.S., where she has safely returned."

Human Rights Office calling it ”a recipe for systematic violations of the rights” of LGBTQ+ people and others.President Joe Biden called the law “a tragic violation of universal human rights — one that is not worthy of the Ugandan people, and one that jeopardizes the prospects of critical economic growth for the entire country.”Homosexuality is criminalized in more than 30 of Africa’s 54 countries. Some Africans see it as behavior imported from abroad and not a sexual orientation."

27,Gambia lawmakers refer repeal of ban on female genital cutting to more committee discussions,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/female-genital-cutting-mutilation-gambia-repeal-law-rcna144017,2024-03-19T09:42:24.996Z,"Lawmakers in Gambia referred an attempted repeal of the 2015 ban on female genital cutting for further committee discussions on Monday.Gambian activists fear a repeal would overturn years of work to better protect girls and women. The legislation was referred to a national committee for further debate and could return to a vote in the weeks and months ahead.Activists in the largely Muslim country had warned that lifting the ban would hurt years of work against a procedure often performed on girls younger than 5 in the mistaken belief that it would control their sexuality.The procedure, which also has been called female genital mutilation, includes the partial or full removal of external genitalia, often by traditional community practitioners with tools such as razor blades or at times by health workers. It can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications but remains a widespread practice in parts of Africa.Jaha Dukureh, the founder of Safe Hands for Girls, a local group that aims to end the practice, told The Associated Press she worried that other laws safeguarding women’s rights could be repealed next. Dukureh underwent the procedure and watched her sister bleed to death.“If they succeed with this repeal, we know that they might come after the child marriage law and even the domestic violence law. This is not about religion but the cycle of controlling women and their bodies,” she said. The United Nations has estimated that more than half of women and girls ages 15 to 49 in Gambia have undergone the procedure.The bill is backed by religious conservatives in the nation of less than 3 million people. Its text says that “it seeks to uphold religious purity and safeguard cultural norms and values.” The country’s top Islamic body has called the practice “one of the virtues of Islam.”Gambia’s former leader, Yahya Jammeh, banned the practice in 2015 in a surprise to activists and with no public explanation. Since the law took effect, enforcement has been weak, with only two cases prosecuted.On Monday, a crowd of men and women gathered outside Gambia’s parliament, some carrying signs protesting the bill. Police in riot gear held them back.Gambia’s parliament of 58 lawmakers includes five women. If the bill eventually passes through parliament, President Adama Barrow is expected to sign it into law. He has not spoken publicly about the legislation.The United States has supported activists who are trying to stop the practice. Earlier this month, it honored Gambian activist Fatou Baldeh at the White House with an International Women of Courage Award.The U.S. Embassy in Gambia declined to say whether any high-level U.S. official in Washington had reached out to Gambian leaders over the bill. In its emailed statement, Geeta Rao Gupta, the top U.S. envoy for global women’s issues, called it “incredibly important” to listen to the voices of survivors like Baldeh.The chairperson of the local Center for Women’s Rights and Leadership, Fatou Jagne Senghore said the bill is “aimed at curtailing women’s rights and reversing the little progress made in recent years.” The president of the local Female Lawyers Association, Anna Njie, said the practice “has been proven to cause harm through medical evidence.”UNICEF said earlier this month that some 30 million women globally have undergone female genital cutting in the past eight years, most of them in Africa but some in Asia and the Middle East.More than 80 countries have laws prohibiting the procedure or allowing it to be prosecuted, according to a World Bank study cited this year by a United Nations Population Fund Q&A published earlier this year. They include South Africa, Iran, India and Ethiopia.“No religious text promotes or condones female genital mutilation,” the UNFPA report says, adding there is no benefit to it.Girls are subjected to the procedure at ages ranging from infancy to adolescence. Long term, it can lead to urinary tract infections, menstrual problems, pain, decreased sexual satisfaction and childbirth complications as well as depression, low self-esteem and post-traumatic stress disorder."

In recent years, the abductions have been concentrated in northwestern and central regions, where dozens of armed groups often target villagers and travelers for huge ransoms.Locals told The Associated Press the assailants on Thursday surrounded the government-owned school in Kaduna State’s Kuriga town just as the pupils and students were about to start the school day at around 8 a.m.Authorities had said earlier that more than 100 students were taken hostage in the attack. Sani Abdullahi, the headteacher, however, told Kaduna Gov. Uba Sani when he visited the town that the total number of those missing after a headcount was 287.“We will ensure that every child will come back. We are working with the security agencies,” the governor told villagers in the area located 55 miles from the capital.No group claimed responsibility for Thursday’s attack though blame fell on armed groups that mostly constitute herders who have been accused of carrying out violent attacks and kidnappings for ransom following decades-long pastoral conflict with host communities.Security forces arrived with the governor several hours later as a search operation widened, while community members and parents gathered to wait for news.The attack occurred days after more than 200 people, mostly women and children, were abducted by extremists in northeastern Nigeria.Women, children and students are often targeted in the mass abductions in the conflict-hit northern region and many victims are released only after paying huge ransoms.Observers say both attacks are a reminder of Nigeria’s worsening security crisis which resulted in the deaths of several hundred people in 2023, according to an AP analysis.People gather around an area were gunmen kidnapped school children in Chikun, Nigeria, Thursday, March 7, 2024.

30,Millions go hungry as war and waves of ethnic killing disrupt food supply in Sudan,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sudan-famine-millions-hungry-civil-war-army-rapid-support-forces-rcna141996,2024-03-06T13:06:16.929Z,"Al Fiteihab, a district in the city of Omdurman across the Nile from Sudan's capital, Khartoum, is on the front line in the battle between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Residents searching for food say they have had to brave RSF checkpoints, as well as artillery and sniper fire by the RSF and the army.People are scared to leave their homes for fear of harassment and beatings. Mahmoud Mohammed, 60, said he was robbed and whipped by RSF fighters when he tried to go to a market last December. “When I got home, my jalabia was covered in blood,” he said, referring to the traditional robe he was wearing. A family member confirmed that Mohammed was bloodied when he arrived home.Mohammed’s wife then began venturing out in an effort to find food, but stopped after hearing that a group of women had been detained by the RSF and that others had gone missing. Two other residents said they had also heard of women going missing early this year. Reuters was unable to independently confirm these reports of disappearances. Last month, Mohammed and his family escaped from Al Fiteihab.Electrical and water facilities have been damaged in the fighting, residents said, depriving them of power and running water. Many have suffered from diarrhea after being forced to drink untreated water from the Nile. The World Health Organization has reported more than 10,000 suspected cholera cases across the country since the outbreak of the war.Mohieldin Jaafar helped to set up soup kitchens early in the war, but he said they ran out of supplies.  Sayed Sheashaa / Reuters In an effort to feed thousands of residents in Al Fiteihab, volunteers set up soup kitchens early in the war that served gruel, rice and flat bread once or twice a day. But the communal kitchens were forced to cut back on these meals when an RSF siege of the area cut short their supplies last July, volunteer Mohieldin Jaafar told Reuters.The volunteers are part of the so-called “emergency response rooms” — a network that has been feeding and evacuating residents in areas across the country. Three volunteers were killed by artillery shells and stray bullets in Al Fiteihab last year as they tried to help fellow residents, according to two volunteers.In late February, the Sudanese army made advances in the area, breaking the siege on one part of Al Fiteihab. That has allowed food to start trickling in.The military and the RSF together staged a coup against longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but went to war when tensions rose over a planned transition toward civilian rule and elections. The RSF quickly took control of most of Khartoum, despite the army’s advantage in airpower and heavy weaponry. The paramilitary also tightened its grip on Darfur, which has been wracked by more than two decades of conflict and displacement.A man inspects damage as he walks through the rubble by a destroyed car outside a house that was hit by an artillery shell in southern  Khartoum in June.AFP via Getty ImagesThe current war has triggered waves of ethnic killing in Darfur. Reuters has chronicled the violence there, which was spearheaded by the RSF and its allied militias. In a series of reports, the news agency exposed how the war unleashed a lethal, racially charged campaign against the Masalit people of West Darfur.The RSF evolved from militias that were used to crush an insurgency that flared in Darfur in the early 2000s. By 2008, an estimated 300,000 people had died in the violence, many from starvation.So far, the war in Sudan has killed more than 14,000 people, according to U.N. estimates, and driven more than eight million from their homes, making Sudan the world’s largest displacement crisis.'A death sentence'Before the conflict, Khartoum had been almost entirely untouched by the fighting that ravaged Darfur. But people in many areas of the capital now find themselves caught in a war zone between the army and the RSF.Across the Nile from Al Fiteihab, some 2,800 people are trapped in areas around the Sudanese army’s base in Al Shajarah neighborhood in Khartoum, according to two volunteers who escaped the area at the end of last year.One of the volunteers, Gihad Salaheldin, said that after running out of food, men began sneaking out under cover of nightfall to search for supplies. Residents have also been drinking untreated water from the Nile, volunteers said.Gihad Salaheldin said that after running out of food, men began sneaking out under cover of nightfall to search for supplies.Sayed Sheashaa / ReutersAcross the capital, the communications blackout forced communal kitchens to suspend operations because they could no longer receive donations sent via a mobile banking app. The emergency response rooms in Khartoum state said Sunday that they had been forced to shut 221 of these kitchens because of the blackout.Recently, donations have started to trickle in again as volunteers sporadically gain access to the internet using billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink system in some places.But little international aid is getting into Sudan as humanitarian agencies struggle to get the necessary entry and transport permits from authorities. The United States and the European Union have criticized both the army and the RSF for the breakdown in aid distribution.Displaced people line up to receive aid from a charity organization in Gedaref, in December.AFP via Getty ImagesSwaths of Darfur haven’t received aid since before the war began, according to residents and aid agencies. After previously blocking the entry of aid from Chad into Darfur, a U.N. official said Tuesday on X that the Sudanese authorities had agreed to the transfer of aid through a border crossing into North Darfur.Addressing RSF appeals for agencies to deliver aid to areas under its control, army commander Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said in February: “This will not happen until we end this war and defeat these criminal rebels.”A charity kitchen providing food for the displaced at a camp in Wad Madani, the capital of Sudan's al-Jazirah state, in June.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Sudanese Foreign Ministry, which is aligned with the army, has accused the RSF of plundering and blocking aid, as have some aid agencies. The RSF has denied looting and has said any rogue actors in its ranks will be held responsible.An assessment by Doctors Without Borders in January found that in North Darfur’s Zamzam displacement camp, home to some 400,000 people, an estimated one child is dying every two hours. Almost 40% of children ages, six months to 2 years old, were malnourished, the group found.If aid didn’t reach Darfur soon, it would be “a death sentence for millions in desperate need,” the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Jan Egeland said.In South Darfur’s Kalma camp, home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people, adults are struggling to survive on a gruel of sorghum flour and water, while malnourished children are getting infections and malaria, according to aid workers and residents.Fatma Ibrahim's twin babies, Jana and Janat, are being treated for severe malnourishment.Handout via ReutersMohammed Omar, a resident of Kalma, said that he and his family have been displaced four times since the war began. He receives one meal a day — a dumpling made of sorghum flour and water that would normally be eaten with a meat stew. “There is not a day we don’t go to the cemetery to bury people,” he said.Fatma Ibrahim was pregnant with twins as the fighting spread last year. She said that after giving birth in December, she was unable to afford baby formula and couldn’t breastfeed because she lacked enough to eat.Her twin girls, Jana and Janat — Arabic for heaven and heavens — quickly became malnourished and were admitted to a medical center in Kalma.Ibrahim, 27, spoke via WhatsApp from the medical center. “There is no money, no food, no milk,” she said. “There is nothing.”"
31,Haiti orders nightly curfew after a weekend of violence and prison break,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/haiti-orders-nightly-curfew-violence-prison-break-rcna141600,2024-03-04T12:00:59.440Z,"Authorities have ordered a nighttime curfew in an attempt to regain control of Haiti’s streets after an explosion of violence during the weekend, including gunmen from gangs overrunning the country’s two biggest prisons and freeing their inmates.A 72-hour state of emergency began Sunday night, and the government said it would set out to find the killers, kidnappers and other violent criminals that it reported escaped from prison.“The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,” said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, who is serving as acting prime minister.Prime Minister Ariel Henry traveled abroad last week to try to salvage support for bringing in a United Nations-backed security force to help stabilize Haiti in its conflict with increasingly powerful crime groups.Colombian inmates talk to journalists inside the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Sunday after hundreds of prisoners fled.Odelyn Joseph / APThe emergency decree was issued after a deadly weekend that marked a new low in Haiti’s downward spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday — four of them police officers — as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince, including the country’s international airport and the national soccer stadium.But the attack on the National Penitentiary late Saturday was a big shock Haitians, even though they are accustomed to living under the constant threat of violence.Almost all of the estimated 4,000 inmates escaped, leaving the normally overcrowded prison eerily empty Sunday with no guards in sight and plastic sandals, clothing and furniture strewn across the concrete patio. Three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance.In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires.Among the few dozen that chose to stay in the prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. Amid the fighting Saturday night, several of the Colombians shared a video pleading for their lives.“Please, please help us,” one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in the message widely shared on social media. “They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.”On Sunday, Uribe told journalists who walked into the normally highly guarded facility, “I didn’t flee because I’m innocent.”Colombia’s foreign ministry called on Haiti to provide “special protection” for the men.A second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates was also overrun.Gang gunmen also occupied and vandalized the nation’s top soccer stadium, holding one employee hostage for hours, Haiti’s soccer federation said.Gunfire was reported in several neighborhoods in the capital. Internet service for many residents was down as Haiti’s top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage.In the space of less than two weeks, several state institutions have been attacked by the gangs, which are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. As part of coordinated attacks by gangs, four police officers were killed Thursday.After gangs opened fire at Haiti’s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country and on Sunday night urged all American citizens to depart as soon as possible. The embassy said it would also cancel until Thursday all consular appointments.The Biden administration, which has steadfastly refused to commit troops to any multinational force while offering instead money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation with grave concern.The surge in attacks follows violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on a proposed U.N.-backed security mission in Haiti to be led by that East African country.Henry took over as prime minister following Moise’s assassination and has repeatedly postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven’t happened in almost a decade.Haiti’s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned by gangs, which are estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince.Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal is to capture Haiti’s police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry’s return.The prime minister, a neurosurgeon, has shrugged off calls for him to resign and didn’t comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home."
