The case, brought by Mr Huang's family, was scheduled to begin in the California Superior Court this week. If the trial had gone ahead, it would have brought increased scrutiny of the firm's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technology. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed and reports have said the deal still needs to be approved by a judge. Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Before the settlement, Tesla argued that Mr Huang had misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident. The firm has previously won trials in California by arguing that drivers involved had not followed its instructions to maintain attention while using the system. The electric vehicle (EV) maker faces a series of lawsuits over crashes related to the alleged use of its driver-assistant technology. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also been investigating some accidents involving Autopilot. For many years, Tesla has promised to produce an autonomous car but has yet to launch one. On Friday, Mr Musk said the company plans to unveil a self-driving robotaxi in August. The settlement with Mr Huang's family comes at a time when the company is battling weakening sales. Deliveries slid sharply in the first three months of this year as Tesla grappled with a fire at its European factory, global shipping disruption and growing competition. Tesla has cut prices repeatedly in response to increased competition from rivals such as BYD but demand in key markets like China has fallen. Tesla's shares have lost almost a third of their value since the start of this year.",9 April 2024,tech
2,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240404-why-we-have-co-evolved-with-technology-tom-chatfield-wise-animals,Why we have co-evolved with technology,"Our relationship with technology has a far deeper history than it seems, argues the philosopher and author Tom Chatfield in his book Wise Animals. The computer scientist Alan Kay once observed: ""Technology is anything that was invented after you were born, everything else is just stuff."" There's some truth to this: when asked to name a world-changing technology, many people might reach for something recent like AI, smartphones or the internet. What comes less readily to mind are the older ones, such as stone tools. However, if we want to understand today's technology better, we need to consider our long-running relationship with it, says philosopher and author Tom Chatfield. In his new book, Wise Animals: How Technology Made Us Who We Are , Chatfield argues we have co-evolved with technology over the last few million years. The entire human story, he says, is entwined with the innovations we create. Chatfield (who also contributes to BBC.com ) spoke to science writer David Robson about our ancestor's relationship with tech, how it has become an extension of our minds, and the insights that we can draw from taking a longer perspective on today’s developments. What inspired you to write Wise Animals? As someone who loves technology, I've been very frustrated by the way that it’s so often talked about – as though people are just consumers who are interested in buying technologies with a bunch of features that are going to fix their problems. Technology is implicated in everything we do; it's bound up with our politics, our personal relationships, the education of our children and the future of our planet. So it feels very important to me that we have a rich, multi-faceted way of talking and thinking about technology that gets the full spectrum of human activities into these discussions. As part of your research, you looked deep into prehistory and human evolution. What should we know about our ancestors' relationship with technology? The crucial point for me is that we can't put our finger on a single moment in which technology emerged, but we can say that technological culture predates the evolution of anything like Homo sapiens . When our ancient ancestors started crafting fine stone tools, and then later started creating survival strategies through fire and the harnessing of artificial heat, they moved to a place where technological expertise and bodies of knowledge were non-optional; when survival strategy was predicated upon intergenerational knowledge – an adaptation through nurture, rather than through nature. You suggest that technology is now so entwined with who we are that it's become an extension of our minds. What ethical issues does this bring? I borrow this concept from the philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers. They made the point that, in many ways, human minds are literally extended into aspects of the environment surrounding them. So when I write things down, or even when I use my fingers to count, I'm outsourcing an aspect of cognition. The same occurs when I use a computer to manipulate shapes on a screen to see whether they will or won't fit together or fit into a certain space. I am almost becoming a coupled system with that device in order to perform a cognitive act. Their paper predated the rise of the smartphone, and the thesis was so radical at the time that they had trouble finding a publisher, but it has now come to seem almost like common sense. If your phone batteries run out, you feel like a little bit of your mind is missing. A large part of your mental or cognitive capacities are bound up with the human-made world, and the ethics of these things and the values embedded in them are very important. For example, I could theoretically outsource a lot of child-raising to automated systems. I could set up surveillance cameras with climate control and AI. My children could be monitored in their rooms with facial recognition, and when they're sad, it could produce voices that cheer them up or it could them the story when they’re ready for bed. Fairly obviously, that is a horrific scenario, because, by outsourcing these things, I completely withdraw from a mutually caring, loving relationship with my children. The model for me is that we need a knowing and informed negotiation with the technologies around us – a conversation about what we want from the human-made world, why we want it, and which of its offerings might not be aligned with human thriving. These are incredibly important conversations. We mustn't be afraid to use the language of values and sentiment and morality when it comes to technology. As a prosaic personal example, I'm happy to offload navigational skills to my phone, but I hate it when my phone starts auto-suggesting answers to people's messages. I don't really want to offload my social cognition to a computer – I'd rather engage in real communication from my mind to another person's . Precisely. The question is, what tasks are so dangerous, dull, demeaning or repetitive that we're delighted to outsource them, and what do we feel are important to be done ourselves or by other humans? If I was going to be judged in a trial, I don't necessarily want an algorithm to pass a verdict on me, even if the algorithm is demonstrably very fair, because there's something about the human solidarity of people in society standing in judgement of other people. At work, I might prefer to have a relationship with human colleagues – to talk to and explain myself to other people – rather than just getting the work done more efficiently. Technology may have evolved with us, but it’s not alive. Yet many of the latest technologies, especially artificial intelligences, can appear to act like they have a mind, tricking us into recognising some kind of sentience. You describe this as the ""anthropomorphic delusion"". What is it? And why is it dangerous? There's a double danger to anthropomorphism. The first is that we treat machines like people, and project personalities, intentions and thoughts onto artificial intelligences. Although these systems are extraordinarily sophisticated, they don't possess anything like the human sense. And it's very dangerous to act as though they do. For a start, they don't have a consistent worldview; they are miraculously brilliant forms of autocomplete, working on pattern recognition, working on prediction. This is very powerful, but they tend to hallucinate and make up details that don't exist, and they will often contain various forms of bias or exclusion based upon a particular training set. But an AI can respond fast and plausibly to anything, and as human beings, we are very predisposed to equate speed and plausibility with truth. And that's a very dangerous thing. You may also like: Similarly, we might overlook the very large corporations that lie behind these entities, who have their own agendas, their own modes of profit, their own issues around privacy, and so on. So anthropomorphism gets in the way of something really important, which is the well-informed, critically engaged process of debating what these systems are, what they can do for us, what their risks are, and how we should deploy and regulate them The other danger of anthropomorphising technology is that it can lead us to think of and treat ourselves like we're machines. But we are nothing like large language models: we are emotional creatures with minds and bodies who are deeply influenced by our physical environment, by our bodily health and well-being. Perhaps most importantly, we shouldn’t see [a machine’s] efficiency as a model for human thriving. We don't want to optimise ourselves with perfectible components, within some vast consequentialist system. The idea that humans can have dignity and autonomy and potential is very ill-served by the desire to optimise, maximise and perfect ourselves.

3,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68718291,X gives free blue ticks to its most popular users,"X, formerly Twitter, is giving blue ticks to its most ""influential"" users in a significant change of policy. Those with more than 2,500 verified followers - people already paying for X Premium - have been given premium features for free. As well as the blue tick, the users will see fewer adverts on X. The social media platform also announced it was clearing bots so people may notice follower numbers decreasing. Blue ticks were originally a way to verify users were who they claimed to be, but they became a paid-for feature after Elon Musk purchased the site. However, according to messages received by people who have been given the features, it is now being given out without cost if a person is an ""influential member of the community"". Premium users also see their tweets ranked higher when replying to others, and it enables them to apply for revenue sharing from adverts on the site. Meanwhile, people with more than 5,000 verified followers have been given free access to Premium+, which removes almost all adverts and ranks their tweets even higher when replying to another person. It comes after Mr Musk announced the feature in late March. Before X was bought by Mr Musk, the blue tick was a badge of verification given for free by the platform. It was originally used as a tool of authentication, designed to help stop fake accounts and the spread of misinformation. The blue tick was once seen as a marker of a person's authoritativeness on the site, as only a few people could become verified, such as celebrities, government workers and journalists. Mr Musk disliked this system, which he criticised as creating a split between ""lords and peasants"". Under the billionaire, the blue tick instead became a symbol showing that an account had subscribed to X Premium - previously called Twitter Blue - with a verification process attached to that payment. But now it has become a combination of the two - with a person simply seen as prominent if they are followed by enough people with a checkmark of their own.",4 April 2024,tech
4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68730138,Google using AI to come up with search answers in UK trial,"Google has begun trialling search answers written by artificial intelligence (AI) in the UK, after the feature was tested in the US last year. Initially only a small proportion of logged-in UK users will see an AI-generated ""overview"" at the top of some search results. While Google is the most popular search engine, Microsoft's rival Bing already integrates its Copilot AI. But some publishers worry AI answers may reduce visits to their sites. They fear longer chatbot-style responses will satisfy users' curiosity without having to visit their websites, while AI answers will also contain fewer links and ads. The ""Search Generative Experience"" - as Google dubs the feature - has been available for nearly a year in the US, but only to users who signed up via Google Labs. It said the UK experiment will involve a ""small slice"" of UK search traffic, selected from logged-in users. It comes as a front-page report in the Financial Times suggested that the firm was considering offering subscriptions for some premium AI search features in the future. Google denied it was ""working on or considering an ad-free search experience"". Hema Budaraju, who helps drive Google's generative AI efforts in search, told the BBC its new search results will still display links and ads. She said it was a ""priority"" to continue to send traffic to creators, and claimed AI-powered search results were ""actually showing more links to a wider range of sources"". The ""proof was in the pudding"", she said, adding that so far users were clicking on an increased range of sources too. The AI-generated ""overview"" will be shown only in response to certain queries, where current trials have suggested they were helpful. Ms Budaraju said a search for ""how to get marks off painted walls"" is one example that people have found useful. But Google is aware of the risk, common to AI systems, that they can sometimes generate content that is harmful, offensive, display racial or gender bias, or factually wrong. Ms Budaraju said the tech giant wanted to maintain ""information quality"", and it would ""put in a lot of care and attention to do this in a responsible way"". As a result, she said Google chose to make answers less fluent and more constrained, focusing instead on accuracy. For example, it is not generating AI answers to all queries, particularly where there aren't sufficient high quality sources of information. Users can send feedback if they encounter problems with the results - and Google is clear this is an experiment. ""We will find issues of bias and safety,"" she said, ""but the commitment is to find [these] and then invest in making it better"". The firm says US users have responded positively so far, but if the trial is successful and AI generated search answers are eventually used by billions of people, that may bring further challenges. For example, researchers have pointed to the large amounts of electricity required to power the computing that powers big AI systems. That is energy use that comes at an environmental price.",4 April 2024,tech
5,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68722542,Ukraine gives award to foreign vigilantes for hacks on Russia,"A team of vigilante hackers carrying out cyber-attacks against Russia has been sent awards of gratitude by Ukraine's military. The team, One Fist, has stolen data from Russian military firms and hacked cameras to spy on troops. The certificates are a controversial sign of how modern warfare is shifting. Concerns have been raised about the practice of states encouraging civilian hackers. One of the hackers called ""Voltage"" has been co-ordinating hacks from his home in the US. His real name is Kristopher Kortright and he is an IT worker from Michigan. The 53-year-old told the BBC he is delighted his efforts for Ukraine have been officially recognised with a certificate of gratitude. One Fist is made up of hackers from eight different countries including the UK, US and Poland. They have collectively launched dozens of cyber-attacks - celebrating each one on social media. The certificates were sent to them all for ""a significant contribution to the development and maintenance of vital activities of the military"". They were signed by the commander of the Airborne Assault Forces of Ukraine. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has controversially been encouraging volunteer hackers to attack Russian targets. But sending out official awards to foreign civilians is being seen as a controversial move and a sign of the times. Although many nations, including the UK and the US, have official award systems for ethical hacking, this is thought to be the first time a country has awarded hackers for malicious and possibly criminal hacks. In October, in response to the increase in vigilante hacking in Ukraine and in the Gaza conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned against the use and encouragement of civilian hackers. It published guidelines to reinforce the ethos of the rules of war laid out in the existing Geneva Conventions. Dr Lukasz Olejnik, author of Philosophy of Cyber-security, said Ukraine's awards to foreign hackers are potentially problematic. ""Giving out awards may further blur the lines between combatants and civilians, and even undermine the recent call by the ICRC to limit and end the involvement of civilians in combat operations. In the long run, such an erosion is dangerous,"" he said. Dr Olejnik also said it is a ""testament of our times"" that cyber is now considered as a domain of operations and that anyone can join the fight online. Kristopher started hacking Russia when it launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and says he has devoted himself to the cause and sacrificed a lot. ""I've lost my job doing this and spent all my life savings in pursuit of a victory for Ukraine,"" he said from his home office. ""This award is a real morale-booster,"" he said. The awards do not state which cyber-attacks were most useful, but Voltage has three in mind as the most likely candidates. At the start of the invasion in 2022, One Fist spent months mapping out the physical and cyber-locations of hundreds of publicly viewable CCTV cameras in Ukraine. It was discovered that Russian forces were using them to monitor troops, so his team helped get the cameras switched off. Conversely, it was One Fist that hacked into cameras in occupied Crimea to catalogue Russian tanks and equipment being moved over the Kerch bridge. And most recently, in January, Kristopher and others also successfully hacked into a prominent Russian weapons-maker and stole 100 gigabytes of private data, which led to a public celebration from the Ukrainian authorities. ""The array of information transferred to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine contains drawings, specifications, patents, software referring to both existing and promising military developments,"" the announcement said. Ukraine added that the data stolen was a ""significant blow"" to Moscow and worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) - although it did not say how this figure was reached The Ukraine conflict prompted a surge of cyber-activity - mostly from supporters of Ukraine. Groups like the Anonymous collective targeted Russia with disruptive and low-level hacks that Russia largely brushed off. In some instances, TV and radio stations were hijacked and news websites defaced. Russian authorities too have been accused of working with vigilante hacking groups like Killnet to attack Ukraine, but has never admitted having any relationship to the gangs. Most of the vigilante hacking activity on both sides dissipated after the first year as the war ground on. But One Fist has kept attacking Russia and increasingly worked closely with the Ukrainian forces on choosing targets. Emily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs and editor of Chatham House Cyber Policy journal, agrees that the hacking awards are a landmark moment that might shift thinking about how cyber volunteers are used in conflicts. ""Governments usually discourage non-state actors from taking direct action in the cyber-domain, for fear of escalation or unintended consequences, but wartime is often a period of extraordinary technological innovation, and the Ukraine invasion is no exception,"" she said. ""Sometimes these events force a reconsideration of issues that have previously been taboo."" Kristopher says his team has built up a strong relationship with the Ukrainian military. ""They send us ideas and we send them options but they don't ever give us any help or funding as I think that would cross some sort of line,"" he said. Kristopher recognises that receiving military awards is controversial, but is determined to keep hacking for Ukraine.",4 April 2024,tech
6,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68717863,Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj want stop to 'predatory' music AI,"Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj are among 200 artists calling for the ""predatory"" use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the music industry to be stopped. In an open letter also signed by Katy Perry and the estate of Frank Sinatra, they warn AI ""will set in motion a race to the bottom"" if left unchecked. Tech giants including YouTube have tested AI music-making tools . ""We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal artists' voices and likenesses,"" they said. They have called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"". In an open letter organised by campaign group the Artists' Rights Alliance and posted on long-form writing site Medium , the artists say AI will ""infringe upon our rights and devalue the rights of human artists"" if it is used irresponsibly. They said the way that artists' work is used to train some AI models and systems was ""an assault on human creativity"", and warned it was being used to ""violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem"". Tom Kiehl, interim head of industry association UK Music, said he shared the concerns of artists who worry their work is being used to train AI without their permission. ""This amounts to music laundering and any companies engaged in these practices must stop and take a more responsible approach to our music industry,"" he said. ""Ensuring artists have given their consent and receive appropriate credit and compensation for the use of their work on AI systems must be the foundation to a more responsible approach."" Artists spanning creative disciplines and genres have spoken out about how AI is used in recent months, after a song which used AI to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral online. Drake voiced disapproval over the song which sounded a lot like him - but was in fact generated using AI voice cloning tools - and appeared on Spotify and Apple Music before being abruptly pulled down . Other artists have since spoken out about it, with Sting telling the BBC he believes musicians face ""a battle"" to defend their work against the rise of songs written by AI. ""The building blocks of music belong to us, to human beings,"" he said. But not all musicians oppose developments in or use of AI across the music industry, and electronic artist Grimes and DJ David Guetta are among those backing the use of such AI tools. Grimes has even encouraged fans and budding musicians to use her voice ""without penalty"" and said she would split royalties on successful AI-generated tracks using her voice . The BBC has approached Google, which owns YouTube, for comment.",2 April 2024,tech
7,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68675654,AI Safety: UK and US sign landmark agreement,"The UK and US have signed a landmark deal to work together on testing advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The agreement signed on Monday says both countries will work together on developing ""robust"" methods for evaluating the safety of AI tools and the systems that underpin them. It is the first bilateral agreement of its kind. UK tech minister Michelle Donelan said it is ""the defining technology challenge of our generation"". ""We have always been clear that ensuring the safe development of AI is a shared global issue,"" she said. ""Only by working together can we address the technology's risks head on and harness its enormous potential to help us all live easier and healthier lives."" The secretary of state for science, innovation and technology added that the agreement builds upon commitments made at the AI Safety Summit held in Bletchley Park in November 2023. The event, attended by AI bosses including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and tech billionaire Elon Musk, saw both the UK and US create AI Safety Institutes which aim to evaluate open and closed-source AI systems. While things have felt quiet on the AI safety front since the summit, the AI sector itself has been extremely busy. Competition between the biggest AI chatbots - such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude - remains ferocious. So far the almost exclusively US-based firms behind all of this activity are still cooperating with the concept of regulation, but regulators have yet to curtail anything these companies are trying to achieve. Similarly, regulators have not demanded access to information the AI firms are unwilling to share, such as the data used to train their tools or the environmental cost of running them . The EU's AI Act is on its way to becoming law and once it takes effect it will require developers of certain AI systems to be upfront about their risks and share information about data used. This is important, after OpenAI recently said it would not release a voice cloning tool it developed due to ""serious risks"" the tech presents, particularly in an election year. In January, a fake, AI-generated robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden urged voters to skip a primary election in New Hampshire. Currently in the US and UK, AI firms are mostly regulating themselves. Currently, the majority of AI systems are only capable of performing single, intelligent tasks that would usually be completed by a human. Known as ""narrow"" AI, these tasks can range from quickly analysing data or providing a desired response to a prompt. But there are fears that more intelligent ""general"" AI tools - capable of completing a range of tasks usually performed by humans - could endanger humanity. ""AI, like chemical science, nuclear science, and biological science, can be weaponised and used for good or ill,"" Prof Sir Nigel Shadbolt told the BBC's Today programme. But the University of Oxford professor said fears around AI's existential risk ""are sometimes a bit overblown"". ""We've got to be really supportive and appreciative of efforts to get great AI powers thinking about and researching what the dangers are,"" he said. ""We need to understand just how susceptible these models are, and also how powerful they are."" Gina Raimondo, the US commerce secretary, said the agreement will give the governments a better understanding of AI systems, which will allow them to give better guidance. ""It will accelerate both of our Institutes' work across the full spectrum of risks, whether to our national security or to our broader society,"" she said. ""Our partnership makes clear that we aren't running away from these concerns - we're running at them.""",2 April 2024,tech
8,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68675652,Temu U-turns on terms of cash 'giveaway' offer,"Chinese e-retailer Temu has significantly changed the terms of a cash giveaway after customers expressed concerns. Participants in the promotion - which has gone viral on social media - receive up to £50, but had to agree to permanently hand over considerable amounts of personal data. Previously, Temu had said these were ""standard terms and conditions"". But now it says it has ""tweaked"" those terms because they were ""overly broad"". Data watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office, which had been looking into concerns about Temu's offer, said it would ""continue to consider the concerns raised"". The Chinese-owned online marketplace launched in the US in 2022 and the UK last year. It has been described as ""Amazon on steroids"" by retail experts and is known for selling goods at extremely cheap prices, using the slogan ""shop like a billionaire"". But it has faced criticism from politicians, with a US government investigation finding an ""extremely high risk"" that products on Temu could have been made with forced labour . The firm's giveaway gives new users 24 hours to sign up other people using a shareable link so each receive a cash reward of between £40 and £50 - paid to their PayPal accounts - or in Temu store credit. Existing Temu account holders can also participate, but appear to have to reach a higher threshold for such rewards. Thousands of users eager to cash in on the promotion have been seen posting links across social media sites. But it has also been the subject of memes and posts scrutinising the rules. The section receiving the most scrutiny states that ""except to the extent prohibited by applicable law"", participants give the company consent to use and publish their ""photo, name, likeness, voice, opinions, statements, biographical information, and/or hometown and state"" for advertising or promotional purposes. It adds this can take place in any media worldwide and ""in perpetuity"" - meaning with no fixed end date. One such post on X (formerly Twitter) with screengrabs of the campaign's usage and publicity rules has been viewed more than two million times, according to the platform's metrics. A number of other X users claimed the rules would allow Temu to sell their data or even create deepfake adverts - though those claims were strenuously denied by the retailer. But now, the fast growing, Chinese-owned retailer has changed those rules, saying ""some participants"" in the cash offer had ""expressed concern"". It said it had ""tweaked"" the terms and conditions ""to make it clear that we only ever use username and profile pictures in this promotion for referral functionality and winner announcements"". ""The previous terms and conditions were overly broad and inadvertently included promotional uses that Temu does not engage in,"" it added. ""Customer trust and satisfaction is at the heart of Temu, and we do not and will not sell customer data."" This is a U-turn compared with previous statements from the company. Previously, a Temu spokesperson had said giveaways were commonplace across many firms and different industries, and cited its e-commerce rival Shein as an example of a firm running promotions with ""nearly identical terms and conditions"". ""If these standard terms and conditions for run-of-the-mill promotional activities are newsworthy, then we urge you to be fair and report on their use by other companies instead of singling out Temu,"" the spokesperson had said. Experts had also raised concerns about the terms of the promotion. ""Giving away permission for Temu to use your 'voice' and 'biographical information' will understandably concern its customers,"" said Lisa Webb, Which? consumer law expert. ""These offers are going viral on social media, including to young people, but consumers should definitely consider whether they are comfortable giving this sensitive data away in return for cash."" She had added that ""while Temu isn't the first platform to excessively hoover up data, there are definite question marks over whether requesting permission for personal data to be used 'worldwide' is proportionate in any circumstances"". Jonathan Kirsop, data protection partner at law firm Pinsent Mason, had told BBC News it was not a wording he had seen used commonly before and the activity implied may have been ""problematic"". The previous terms could have fallen foul of UK data protection rules, which require user consent to be freely given, specific and able to be withdrawn in order for it to be relied upon as a reason for data processing. ""While not always prohibited, making the provision of services conditional on a consent to the use of personal data will often be unlawful on the basis the user may not be considered to have a free choice in delivering that consent, particularly where the data concerned is sensitive, such as biometric data,"" he said. The use of voice data - which is considered biometric data under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - has a higher threshold for lawful use and consent in the UK because it carries greater risks, he added. The data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, had previously said it was ""aware of reports about Temu"" and was ""considering the concerns raised."" In a fresh comment, made after Temu altered the terms and conditions, the data watchdog said: ""Organisations must be clear and transparent about how and why they collect and use people's personal information, and ensure people can make a fully informed decision as to whether to hand over their data."" ""We are aware of reports about Temu, and subsequent updates to the terms and conditions, and continue to consider the concerns raised."" Awais Rashid, professor of cyber security at the University of Bristol, had told BBC News that apps collecting a lot of data - often more than they actually need from users - had become commonplace. He said this, as well as cash incentives or long, sometimes ""indecipherable"" privacy policies and terms, can make the decision more difficult and imbalanced when deciding whether or not we as individuals should part with our data to use a service. ""Whenever there is such a deal being offered we must always look at: what is the consequence of this, and how much of our data is going to be collected, how it is going to be used, and are we comfortable with that?"" he said.

9,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68675500,Sellafield to be prosecuted for IT security offences,"The company which runs the Sellafield nuclear site is being prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) says Sellafield Ltd is alleged to have committed the offences between 2019 and early 2023. The facility, on the Cumbrian coast, is widely regarded as Western Europe's most hazardous nuclear site. The ONR says public safety was not put at risk. The regulator says the decision to prosecute Sellafield follows an investigation it carried out. It says no further details can be given because legal proceedings are now under way. The Guardian reported in December 2023 that Sellafield had been hacked by cyber groups ""closely linked to Russia and China"". In an interview with the BBC later that month, Sellafield's boss, Euan Hutton, insisted there had been no cyber attack on the site. In response to ONR's announcement, Sellafield has issued a statement confirming it had been notified it was to be prosecuted.

Ninja has become synonymous with Twitch since his return to the streaming site in 2020, following a brief stint with Microsoft's rival platform Mixer - which was shutdown in June that year. Such is his popularity on Fortnite that players can pay to make their characters look like him. His status as one of the most recognisable names in streaming has also led to him appearing on mainstream programmes, such as The Masked Singer US. In his post on X , Ninja said he found out about the cancer after visiting a dermatologist for an annual check-up of his moles. ""There was a mole on the bottom of my foot that they wanted to remove just to be careful,"" he said. ""It came back as melanoma, but they are optimistic that we caught it in the early stages."" According to the NHS website , melanoma is a form of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, and is typically caused by ultraviolet light from the sun. It advises people to be careful in the sun, by using sunscreen and reapplying it regularly. Those more at risk of developing melanoma include people with pale skin, a large number of moles, and history of skin cancer in their family. Surgery is the main treatment, but in cases where the cancer has spread, chemotherapy might also be used.",27 March 2024,tech

Powered by a BMW engine and normal fuel, the AirCar flew for 35 minutes between two Slovakian airports in 2021, using runways for take-off and landing. It took just over two minutes to transform from a car into an aircraft. Now vehicles made based on its design will be used within a ""specific geographical region"" of China. Hebei Jianxin Flying Car Technology Company, headquartered in Cangzhou, has purchased exclusive rights to manufacture and use AirCar aircraft inside an undisclosed area. The firm has built its own airport and flight school after a previous acquisition from another Slovak aircraft manufacturer, said Anton Zajac, cofounder of KleinVision, the company which created AirCar. Having led the way in the development of the EV revolution , China is now actively developing flying transport solutions. Last month a firm called Autoflight carried out a test flight of a passenger-carrying drone between the cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The journey, which takes three hours by car, was completed in 20 minutes, it said - although the aircraft contained no passengers. And in 2023 the Chinese firm eHang was awarded a safety certificate by Chinese officials for its electric flying taxi. Here, the UK government has said flying taxis could become a regular feature of the skies by 2028. But unlike these drone-like passenger aircrafts, AirCar does not take off and land vertically, and requires a runway. KleinVision declined to say how much it had sold the technology for. AirCar was issued with a certificate of airworthiness by the Slovak Transport Authority in 2022 and featured in a video published by YouTuber Mr Beast earlier this year. There are still considerable hurdles for this form of transport in terms of infrastructure, regulation and public acceptance of the technology. ""This brave new world of personal transport is acting as a great leveller,"" said aviation consultant Steve Wright. Global attempts to regulate the sector left ""everyone scrambling to come up with a whole new set of questions that need to be asked"". ""In this respect the West's history can sometimes slow things down, as there is a bit of a temptation to try and squeeze these new machines into the old categories,"" Mr Wright added. ""China could well see this as an opportunity to get ahead."" Similar concerns once applied to electric cars - in which China which has become a global market leader . The sale of the Slovakian AirCar could raise questions about whether China might be poised to do the same with flying cars. Mr Wright said while prototypes like the AirCar were ""great fun"", the reality was likely to end up being more mundane ""with queues and baggage checks and whatnot"".",27 March 2024,tech
12,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68664182,Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years',"The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing will drive a spike in energy use, the National Grid has predicted. Both rely on data centres - warehouses full of computer systems. Chief executive John Pettigrew said the power those data centres use would increase six-fold in the next decade. He said the grid was becoming ""constrained"" and ""bold action"" was needed to create a network able to cope with ""dramatically"" growing demand. ""Future growth in foundational technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing will mean larger scale, energy-intensive computing infrastructure,"" Mr Pettigrew said. The National Grid boss said in a speech on Tuesday, shared on LinkedIn , that now was ""a pivotal moment"" for grid transformation - with rising demand for energy-hungry technologies and more people opting for heat pumps or electric cars. ""Today, just like in the 1950s, we find ourselves with a network that's constrained,"" he said. ""Demand on the grid is growing dramatically, and forecast to double by 2050 as heat, transport and industry continue to electrify."" The high-voltage transmission network of cables and pylons that make up the UK's ""supergrid"" is now more than 70 years old. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in line with global targets, grid operators are under pressure to deliver upgrades to current infrastructure that can meet higher consumer demand for electricity in future and do so sustainably by connecting to renewable energy sources. We are at ""a moment in time that requires innovative thinking and bold actions to create a transmission network for tomorrow's future,"" Mr Pettigrew said. Most observers agree that whatever that future looks like, data centres will be a part of it. They have become integral to our modern lives and technologies, operating as a physical home to our digital information stored in the so-called ""cloud"" and other forms of IT equipment that power services and platforms. But all that computing power comes at an environmental cost. Some studies have warned that the AI industry alone could consume as much energy as a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 . The sector has been enjoying an economic boom after the launch of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and image-making tools such as Midjourney. Concern over their energy use and demands on infrastructure has increased in recent years. Official data showed that in the Republic of Ireland, which is home to the European headquarters of several big tech firms such as Google and Facebook-parent Meta, data centres accounted for nearly a fifth of all electricity used in 2022 . The amount of electricity being used by data centres in the country has risen by 400% since 2015 and ignited debate about capacity. Meanwhile, quantum computers, which process data differently to regular computers and can complete complex calculations very quickly, are still mostly being used experimentally to see what they can do. But it is hoped in future they could secure scientific breakthroughs and advance secure methods of communication.",26 March 2024,tech

When Pa Edrissa Manjang began working for Uber Eats, in November 2019, its app did not regularly ask him to send selfies in order to register for jobs. But the Microsoft-powered Uber Eats app increased these verification checks. And in 2021, it said after ""careful consideration"" his account would be removed, due to ""continued mismatches"". An Uber representative said: ""Our real-time ID check is designed to help keep everyone who uses our app safe and includes robust human review to make sure that we're not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the App Drivers and Couriers Union funded Mr Manjang's case. The EHRC was concerned the artificial intelligence in the facial-recognition checks had deprived him of his income. The ADCU said the number of selfies Mr Manjang had been asked for amounted to racial harassment. The union told BBC News it was ""working hard"" to ensure workers' rights were protected as ""the pace of development of AI and machine-learning tools in the workplace accelerates"". Mr Manjang, who was reinstated and continues to work for Uber Eats, in Oxfordshire, said the out-of-court settlement marked the end of a ""long and difficult"" period for him. His case ""shines a spotlight"" on the potential problems with AI, particularly for ""low-paid workers in the gig economy"". And he hoped the decision would help strengthen ""rights and protections of workers in relation to AI, particularly ethnic minorities"". Baroness Falkner, who chairs the EHRC, said Mr Manjang should never have have had to sue Uber Eats to understand the opaque processes affecting his work. ""We are particularly concerned that Mr Manjang was not made aware that his account was in the process of deactivation, nor provided any clear and effective route to challenge the technology,"" she said. Microsoft has previously admitted its facial-recognition software works less well for people belonging to ethnic minorities.

X had accused the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) of taking ""unlawful"" steps to access its data. The US judge dismissed the case and said it was ""evident"" Mr Musk's X Corp did not like criticism. X said it planned to appeal. Imran Ahmed, founder and chief executive of CCDH, celebrated the win, saying Mr Musk had conducted a ""loud, hypocritical campaign"" of harassment and abuse against his organisation in an attempt to ""avoid taking responsibility for his own decisions"". ""The courts today have affirmed our fundamental right to research, to speak, to advocate, and to hold accountable social media companies"" he said, adding that he hoped the ruling would ""embolden"" others to ""continue and even intensify"" similar work. It is a striking loss for the billionaire, a self-described ""free-speech absolutist"". The company, formerly known as Twitter, launched its lawsuit against CCDH in 2023, claiming its researchers had cherry-picked data to create misleading reports about X. It accused the group of ""intentionally and unlawfully"" scraping data from X, in violation of its terms of service, in order to produce its research. It said the non-profit group designed a ""scare campaign"" to drive away advertisers, and it demanded tens of millions of dollars in damages. But in his decision Judge Charles Breyer said Mr Musk was ""punishing the defendants for their speech"". Judge Breyer said X appeared ""far more concerned about CCDH's speech than it is its data collection methods"". He said the company had ""brought this case in order to punish CCDH for ... publications that criticised X Corp - and perhaps in order to dissuade others who might wish to engage in such criticism"". Mr Musk purchased the platform in 2022 for $44bn (£34bn) and swiftly embarked on a slew of controversial changes, sharply reducing its workforce with deep cuts to teams in charge of content moderation and other areas.

15,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68655093,"Apple, Meta and Google to be investigated by the EU","The EU has announced investigations into some of the biggest tech firms in the world over uncompetitive practices. Meta, Apple, and Alphabet, which owns Google, are being looked into for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduced in 2022. If they are found to have broken the rules, the firms can face huge fines of up to 10% of their annual turnover. EU antitrust boss Margrethe Vestager and industry head Thierry Breton announced the investigations on Monday. Just six companies have obligations under the DMA, but they are also the world's largest tech firms: Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and ByteDance. None of the firms are actually based in Europe - five of them are in the US, while ByteDance has headquarters in Beijing. Three of them are now facing questions just two weeks after submitting their compliance reports, which will have been meticulously compiled. It comes three weeks after the EU fined Apple €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking competition laws over music streaming. Meanwhile, the United States accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market in a landmark lawsuit against the tech giant introduced last week . An Apple spokesperson says the company will constructively engage with the investigation and that they're confident that their plan complies with the Digital Markets Act. They added that their teams established a variety of mechanisms to comply with the EU's landmark legislation, as well as privacy and security protections for EU users. ""Throughout, we've demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to the European Commission and developers, listening and incorporating their feedback,"" they said. Meanwhile a Meta spokesperson said the firm's use of subscriptions as an alternative to advertising were ""a well-established business model across many industries"". ""We designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA... we will continue to engage constructively with the Commission,"" they said. Alphabet has been approached for comment. The EU said it will investigate five different possible acts of non-compliance in its announcement: The first two of these investigations concern what is known as ""anti-steering"" - and the EU says it believes the firms are making it difficult for apps to tell users about ways to pay less for their services outside of using app stores' own payment methods. Under the third point, the EU says that Apple is obliged to allow users to easily uninstall apps on their devices, change default settings and be given ""choice screens"" to let them use different browsers or search engines. The EU says Apple's web browser ""choice screen"" does not give people enough choice, and said that some apps, such as Apple Photos, cannot be deleted at all. According to Ms Vestager, the investigation will take around 12 months to complete - though Mr Breton later clarified it could take slightly longer. ""We suspect that the suggested solutions put forward by the three companies do not fully comply with the DMA,"" she said. ""We will now investigate the companies' compliance with the DMA, to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe."" The five cases are consumer-focused, and highly relatable to most people who use products from these companies, which is collectively billions of people worldwide. ""We're talking about the protection of our citizens, we can't just sit around and wait,"" said Thierry Breton, of the EU's decision to act straight away. There is however another reason potentially in mind: European Parliament elections are due to be held in June 2024. Dr Rupprecht Podszun, director of the Institute for Competition Law at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, called it ""a strong signal"" from the EU. ""The DMA is designed for quick results,"" he said. ""The cases that the Commission has selected go to the heart of the business models; these are not marginal issues for the gatekeepers.

16,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68631756,Apple becomes the latest tech giant under siege,"To understand how much the US government's new lawsuit strikes at the heart of the identity Apple has forged for itself, let's first consider the firm's fanbase. Apple has a unique position as a tech brand. I've sat through a lot of Apple events in my time, both virtually and in person, and one thing that always makes us journalists raise an eyebrow is the whooping and cheering from the audience every time a new feature, no matter how small or incremental, is announced. When a new hardware product goes on sale, Apple employees form a guard of honour outside stores and applaud its first buyers - some of whom will have camped outside for hours in advance, and spent thousands of dollars (who else could get away with charging $3,500/£3,499, for a VR headset?). People get tattoos of Apple's distinctive fruit logo. ""Apple is like a strange drug that you just can't quite get enough of,"" wrote Leander Kahney in his 2006 book The Cult of Mac. It is this ""strange drug"" or ""magical experience"", as Apple put it in a statement on Thursday, which is now under fire. So far, Apple's ethos is a wildly successful business model. As I write, the firm is worth $2.6 trillion. Analysis firm CCS Insight estimates that 72% of smartphone handsets bought in North America alone in the last three months of 2023 were iPhones. Samsung took 25%, leaving just 3% for everybody else in the handset business. One of Apple's big selling points is its focus on privacy and security. But the question is whether it achieves this by shutting out the competition. The tech giant has engineered an illegal monopoly in smartphones, according to the sweeping US Department of Justice lawsuit filed on Thursday. Apple routinely blocks web trackers - an irritation for web users but also an important revenue generator for other digital businesses. It also operates a ""walled garden"". This means all Apple products work seamlessly together, and every app, payment method and operating system update is vetted and approved by the tech giant. It is, effectively, a closed ecosystem and that keeps it secure. Developers fume that they have to pay to get in, and also have to follow Apple's strict rules: but Apple says in return they get access to an enormous marketplace of potential customers. The music streaming platform, Spotify, and Epic Games, which makes Fortnite, are the two biggest commercial names to make a vocal stand against this. Fortnite was removed from the App Store: Spotify hasn't gone as far, perhaps because it has millions of iPhone-based subscribers. Apple's biggest smartphone rival is Google's Android, which is a far more sprawling affair. Its operating system has to work across dozens of different devices made by various manufacturers over the years. As a result, it offers more consumer choice - and is inevitably also less secure. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is not the only authority deciding to take a closer look at Apple's unique position. On two occasions now the tech giant has very reluctantly prised open its gates - and both times were caused by the European Union. It was recently forced to open up to other app stores in Europe. It did so very hesitantly, with plenty of warnings about the evil lurking outside of its own digital paradise. Until recently the iPhone didn't even use the same charging cable as almost everything else - most models require a bespoke lightning cable. But the EU is bringing in a common charger rule, and Apple is now selling lightning cable adaptors, as well as changing its most recent model to far more ubiquitous USB-C port. The DOJ doesn't have the same power, however. This will be a court process in which it will have to convince a judge, and it doesn't have a very successful track record of doing that. ""The last time a US court found a Big Tech company guilty of monopolisation dates back to 2001 (Microsoft),"" notes Anne Witt, Professor of Law at EDHEC business school in France. That was about the dominance of Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer, which was installed by default in millions of machines running Windows. It's worth remembering, however, that Apple is not holding its customers hostage, forcing them into its embrace. ""Every case against Apple portrays its users as consumers with no free will. I really struggle with that,"" remarked Carolina Milanesi from tech industry analysis firm, Creative Strategies. I know I have friends with iPhones who have dismissed the ""faff"" of changing to another brand, even if they like the look of something different. But that doesn't mean that Apple is actively stopping them - although a throw-away comment once made by CEO Tim Cook has now come back to bite him. A reporter in an interview mentioned that he was unable to share a video with his mum, who had a different phone. ""Buy your mom an iPhone,"" the Apple CEO joked. Apple has vowed to ""vigorously"" fight the lawsuit and denies the claims.",21 March 2024,tech

Greggs became the fourth major firm to suffer IT issues, following problems at McDonald's, Tesco and Sainsbury's. The Payments Systems Regulator (PSR) said it was reviewing the situation. ""The PSR is aware of the recent payment issues and is assessing their nature to determine whether any further action is needed,"" it said. The PSR is the UK's economic regulator for payment systems, seeking to ensure they work well for those that use them. If it identifies an issue with payments infrastructure resilience, it can pass the matter on to the Bank of England. Such systems are firmly in the spotlight after a series of technical glitches which left customers unable to make purchases. Sainsbury's could not fulfil most online grocery deliveries on Saturday due to issues with an overnight software update which also hit contactless payments in stores. Tesco was also forced to cancel a ""small number"" of orders. The day before, McDonald's restaurants around the world were unable to take orders due to a ""global technology system outage"". On Wednesday, bakery chain Greggs became the latest major retailer to see its IT systems fail in some stores. As a result of the outages being so close together, experts have suggested they could be linked, for example via a common network or payments infrastructure provider. Alan Stephenson-Brown, CEO of IT firm Evolve, said the fact there were several outages was also a ""timely reminder that even large corporations aren't immune to IT troubles."" He said the retailers would have lost millions of pounds. ""This highlights that digital disruption is a principal risk for many retailers. Ensuring contingency planning is in place is vital,"" Mr Stephenson-Brown said. Jamil Ahmed, an engineer at transaction firm Solace, said the potential for ""disruptions and vulnerabilities"" will grow as businesses rely more and more on digital transactions.

19,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68607059,NHS AI test spots tiny cancers missed by doctors,"An AI tool tested by the NHS successfully identified tiny signs of breast cancer in 11 women which had been missed by human doctors. The tool, called Mia, was piloted alongside NHS clinicians and analysed the mammograms of over 10,000 women. Most of them were cancer-free, but it successfully flagged all of those with symptoms, as well as an extra 11 the doctors did not identify. At their earliest stages, cancers can be extremely small and hard to spot. The BBC saw Mia in action at NHS Grampian, where we were shown tumours that were practically invisible to the human eye. But, depending on their type, they can grow and spread rapidly. Barbara was one of the 11 patients whose cancer was flagged by Mia but had not been spotted on her scan when it was studied by the hospital radiologists. Because her 6mm tumour was caught so early she had an operation but only needed five days of radiotherapy. Breast cancer patients with tumours which are smaller than 15mm when discovered have a 90% survival rate over the following five years. Barbara said she was pleased the treatment was much less invasive than that of her sister and mother, who had previously also battled the disease. She told me she met a relative who expressed sympathy that Barbara had ""the Big C"". ""I said, 'it's not a big C, it's a very little one',"" she said. Without the AI tool's assistance, Barbara's cancer would potentially not have been spotted until her next routine mammogram three years later. She had not experienced any noticeable symptoms. Because it works instantly, tools like Mia also have the potential to reduce the waiting time for results from 14 days down to three, claims its developer Kheiron. None of the cases in the trial were analysed by Mia alone - each had a human review as well. Currently two radiologists look at each individual scan, but the hope is that one of them could one day be replaced by the tool, effectively halving the workload for each pair. Of the 10,889 women who participated in the trial, only 81 did not want the AI tool to review their scans, said Dr Gerald Lip, clinical director of breast screening in the north east of Scotland and the doctor who led the project. AI tools are generally pretty good at spotting symptoms of a specific disease, if they are trained on enough data to enable them to be identified. This means feeding the programme with as many different anonymised images of those symptoms as possible, from as diverse a range of people as possible. Getting hold of this data can be difficult because of patient confidentiality and privacy concerns. Sarah Kerruish, Chief Strategy Officer of Kheiron Medical, said it took six years to build and train Mia, which is run on cloud computing power from Microsoft, and it was trained on ""millions"" of mammograms from ""women all over the world"". ""I think the most important thing I've learned is that when you're developing AI for a healthcare situation, you have to build in inclusivity from day one,"" she said. Breast cancer doctors look at around 5,000 breast scans per year on average, and can view 100 in a single session. ""There is an element of fatigue,"" said Dr Lip. ""You get disruptions, someone's coming in, someone's chatting in the background. There are lots of things that can probably throw you off your regular routine as well. And in those days when you have been distracted, you go, 'how on earth did I miss that?' It does happen."" I asked him whether he was worried that tools like Mia might one day take away his job altogether. He said he believed the tech could one day free him up to spend more time with patients. ""I see Mia as a friend and an augmentation to my practice,"" Dr Lip said. Mia isn't perfect. It had no access to any patient history so, for example, it would flag cysts which had already been identified by previous scans and designated harmless. Also, because of current health regulation, the machine learning element of the AI tool was disabled - so it could not learn on the job, and evolve during its use. Every time it was updated it had to undergo a new review. The Mia trial is just one early test, by one product in one location. The University of Aberdeen independently validated the research, but the results of the evaluation have not yet been peer reviewed. The Royal College of Radiologists say the tech has potential. ""These results are encouraging and help to highlight the exciting potential AI presents for diagnostics. There is no question that real-life clinical radiologists are essential and irreplaceable, but a clinical radiologist using insights from validated AI tools will increasingly be a formidable force in patient care."" said Dr Katharine Halliday, President of the Royal College of Radiologists. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK said the increasing number of cancer cases diagnosed each year meant technological innovation would be ""vital"" to help improve NHS services and reduce pressure on its staff. ""More research will be needed to find the best ways to use this technology to improve outcomes for cancer patients,"" she added. There are other healthcare-related AI trials going on around the UK, including an AI tool by a firm called Presymptom Health which is analysing blood samples looking for signs of sepsis before symptoms emerge - but many are still in early stages without published results.",21 March 2024,tech
20,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240319-the-most-sustainable-alternatives-to-lithium-batteries,We rely heavily on lithium batteries – but there's a growing array of alternatives,"Lithium batteries are very difficult to recycle and require huge amounts of water and energy to produce. Emerging alternatives could be cheaper and greener. In Australia's Yarra Valley, new battery technology is helping power the country's residential buildings and commercial ventures – without using lithium. These batteries rely on sodium – an element found in table salt – and they could be another step in the quest for a truly sustainable battery. The global demand for batteries is surging as the world looks to rapidly electrify vehicles and store renewable energy. Lithium ion batteries, which are typically used in EVs, are difficult to recycle and require huge amounts of energy and water to extract . Companies are frantically looking for more sustainable alternatives that can help power the world's transition to green energy. ""Sodium is a much more sustainable source for batteries [than lithium],"" says James Quinn, chief executive of Faradion, the UK-based battery technology company that manufactures the sodium-ion batteries for Yarra Valley utility company Nation Energie. ""It's widely available around the world, meaning it's cheaper to source , and less water intensive to extract ,"" says Quinn. "" It takes 682 times more water to extract one tonne of lithium versus one tonne of sodium . That is a significant amount."" Faradion's sodium-ion batteries are already being used by energy companies around the world to store renewable electricity. And they are just one alternative to our heavy and growing reliance on lithium, which was listed by the European Union as a ""critical raw material"" in 2020 . The market size for the lithium battery is predicted to grow from $57bn (£45bn) in 2023, to $187bn (£150bn) by 2032 . To find promising alternatives to lithium batteries, it helps to consider what has made the lithium battery so popular in the first place. Some of the factors that make a good battery are lifespan, power, energy density, safety and affordability. The downsides are also plentiful: at the end of their lifespan, recycling these batteries is still a complicated process . Extracting individual metals in the battery for recycling involves shedding the metal , then separating them in liquid to extract the desired metal. ""Recycling a lithium-ion battery consumes more energy and resources than producing a new battery, explaining why only a small amount of lithium-ion batteries are recycled,"" says Aqsa Nazir, a postdoctoral research scholar at Florida International University's battery research laboratory. Lithium extraction using evaporation ponds, as is done in countries such as Chile, comes with a high water footprint . Studies show that contaminants may be released into the environment during the evaporation process, potentially affecting nearby communities. Water scarcity caused by mining could also threaten the livelihoods of indigenous communities . The overlap of mining sites with indigenous living areas has also led to forced migration and the abandonment of ancestral villages. An alternative to the evaporation method is hard rock mining , such as is done in Australia. But this has its own drawbacks. For every tonne of lithium mined during hard rock mining, approximately 15 tonnes of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. So, are there viable alternatives to the lithium-ion battery? In sodium-ion batteries, sodium directly replaces lithium. Not unlike lithium-ion batteries, sodium batteries contain four main components – the anode, the cathode, an electrolyte and a separator. The state of the electrolyte varies depending on the manufacturer. The sodium to lithium ratio in the earth's crust is 23,600 parts per million ( ppm ) to 20 ppm . The natural abundance of sodium leads to a much lower cost of extraction . Another factor for the sodium battery is that it can make use of other lower cost materials, replacing copper foils with aluminum foils , for instance. Maria Forsyth, chair of electromaterials and corrosion sciences at Deakin University, Australia, says that switching from lithium to sodium battery production would be fairly low cost. ""Manufacturing wise, the transition is easy because the same factories, which currently produce lithium-ion batteries, can manufacture sodium batteries,"" says Forsyth. ""This means production can be scaled quickly. One benefit of sodium batteries is their safety in transit. ""A unique feature of sodium ion technology is the ability to discharge sodium to zero volts for storage and transportation ,"" says Quinn, Faradion's chief executive. ""This means it can be stored and transported in safer conditions."" The lower flammability risk levels make it a safer option compared to lithium batteries, Quinn says.  One drawback, however, is low energy density. For EV manufacturers, low energy density batteries are problematic because this affects a vehicle's range . While lithium batteries have energy densities between 150-220 Wh/kg (watt-hour per kilogram), sodium batteries have an lower energy density range of 140-160 Wh/kg . Meng says this means it's less likely that sodium batteries will be commercially scaled for use in EVs that require long ranges between charges. Another hurdle is sodium batteries can only manage a short number of charging cycles in its lifespan. Currently, sodium batteries have a charging cycle of around 5,000 times, whereas lithium-iron phosphate batteries (a type of lithium-ion battery) can be charged between 8,000-10,000 times. But researchers are working to solve this – in 2023, scientists and engineers in China achieved 6,000 cycles using a different type of electrode . China's battery technology firm HiNa launched a 100 kWh energy storage power station in 2019 , demonstrating the feasibility of sodium batteries for large-scale energy storage. HiNa has also recently piloted a batch of sodium battery powered electric vehicles . Solid-state batteries use solid electrolytes, instead of the liquid or aqueous electrolytes common in traditional batteries. The two most popular types of solid electrolytes include inorganic solid electrolytes (oxides and sulfides) and solid polymers (polymer salts, or gel polymers). Using solid electrolytes reduces the risk of dendrite formation – those tree-like structures within the battery that can cause battery failure. Solid-state batteries also have a lower risk of flammability , a higher energy density and a faster charging cycle . However, solid-state batteries may be harder to scale quickly than sodium batteries, says Shirley Meng, professor of molecular engineering at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. ""Sodium batteries are lower in cost, and are easier to integrate into current lithium battery production plants."" Based on a 2020 calculation model, the manufacturing costs of solid state batteries are also currently higher than that of lithium ion batteries . To advance solid battery technology, it's essential to find durable solid-state electrolytes. Some researchers say an ideal solid electrolyte is yet to be found . However, Colorado-based Solid Power has designed a sulfide electrolyte-based battery which it claims is 50-100% higher in energy density than modern lithium ion batteries. Solid Power aims to scale its solid-state tech to power 800,000 electric vehicles per year by 2028. Solid-state batteries are currently commercially available in a thin-film format, making them an option for wearable electronics, ""internet of things"" (IoT) devices, for example home security systems and smart lighting. They can also be used in medical devices, such as llika's Stereax M300 , a hip implant device. But while these batteries have some small-scale uses, they aren't currently an option for large-scale energy storage. ""We need to be realistic,"" says Meng. ""Right now, perhaps solid-state batteries are viable for IoT and wearables. But for solid-state tech that can contribute to the energy transition, they will need to be scaled to produce terawatt hours (TWh) of energy."" Lithium-sulphur batteries are similar in composition to lithium-ion batteries – and, as the name suggests, they still use some lithium. The lithium is present in the battery's anode, and sulphur is used in the cathode. Lithium-ion batteries use rare earth minerals like nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) in their cathode. Sulphur is more abundant in the Earth's crust than nickel, manganese and cobalt and its extraction process is less resource intensive. It is also more widely available because it's the by-product of natural gas processing and oil refining. Though supplies of sulphur may fall over the next few decades due to global decarbonisation The US alone produces 8.6 million tonnes of sulphur a year . So although these batteries contain lithium, the abundance of sulphur makes them a potentially more sustainable option compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries, says Aqsa. ""When commercialised, this battery will likely be used for grid storage, though mobile use is also feasible in the longer term."" The similarity with lithium-ion batteries makes lithium-sulphur batteries relatively easy to produce. ""They can be manufactured in the same production plants, saving costs of new technical resources,"" says Nazir. Lithium-sulphur batteries also have additional functional advantages as they have a higher energy density, meaning they produce more power, Nazir adds. ""Sulphur has the capacity to move more electrons. Lithium-sulphur batteries have nine times the energy density of a lithium-ion battery."" However these batteries suffer from poor chargeability. The formation of tree-like structures called dendrites can lead to short circuiting and battery failure. With prototypes working for as little as 50 charge cycles , they aren't yet feasible for use in EVs, for example. Lithium-sulphur batteries are already on the market, where they are used for gadgets requiring batteries with a lighter weight and a longer single charge time. In 2020, Korean chemicals company LG Energy Solutions successfully piloted a drone powered by a lithium-sulphur battery , and confirmed that the battery had a stable charge and discharge cycles. The firm intends to mass produce lithium-sulphur batteries with double the intensity of lithium-ion batteries by 2027. Meanwhile the German battery startup Theion is also working to bring lithium-sulphur batteries to electric vehicles . If one thing is clear, it's that no single battery type is going to be a universal answer to replacing lithium ion batteries. But as Forsyth points out, that's not a bad thing. ""We don't need to replace the lithium in all batteries, what is needed is a diversification of battery technology,"" says Forsyth. ""Maybe it's not having one replacement but having alternatives that can be deployed where it's right to deploy them."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",20 March 2024,tech
21,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68615042,Fraud risk for Vans customers after data breach,"Customers of the footwear brand Vans have been warned they may be at risk of fraud or identity theft following a data breach at its parent company. VF Group detected ""unauthorised activities"" on a part of its IT systems in December 2023, Vans say. It says no detailed financial information or passwords were stolen. But it added that ""it cannot be excluded"" that criminals could attempt to misuse the customer data they had obtained. VF Group also owns other brands including Timberland, The North Face and Dickies. The BBC has asked the company if customers of those brands are also affected. In an email to its customers , Vans says the data breach was first detected by VF Group on 13 December, and was ""apparently carried out by external threat actors."" The company says it ""immediately took steps"" to deal with the threat, including shutting down affected IT systems and hiring cybersecurity experts. By 15 December, it says, the hackers were ejected. ""Our investigation revealed that the incident has affected some personal information of our customers, that we normally store and process in order to manage online purchases, such as email address, full name, phone number, billing address, shipping address,"" the email said. But it added the firm did not ""collect or retain"" payment or financial data, such as bank account or credit card information, so there was ""no chance that any detailed financial information was exposed to the threat actors."" It said it had no information of customers being affected so far but warned the incident ""may result in attempts of identity theft, phishing and possibly fraud in general."" It has advised customers to be careful of suspicious emails, texts and telephone calls asking for personal information. Vans says it has contacted the relevant law enforcement agencies and says it will review its cybersecurity policies.",20 March 2024,tech
22,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68607060,British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman joins Microsoft,"Microsoft has announced British Artificial Intelligence pioneer Mustafa Suleyman will lead its newly-formed division, Microsoft AI. Mr Suleyman currently heads start-up Inflection AI, but is best known for co-founding AI firm DeepMind. It was one of the UK's best known AI firms and was bought by Google in 2014. Mr Suleyman's move cements Microsoft's reputation as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), a field in which Google is appearing to struggle. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Suleyman said he was ""excited"" to take up his new position, adding that he would be taking several colleagues to Microsoft with him, including ""friend and long time collaborator"" Karén Simonyan as chief scientist. He said he would be ""leading all consumer AI products and research"", including the Copilot chatbot, Bing and Edge. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella described Mr Suleyman as a ""visionary, product maker, and builder of pioneering teams that go after bold missions"". ""I am excited for them to contribute their knowledge, talent, and expertise to our consumer AI research and product making,"" he added. After leaving Google in 2022, Mr Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI, which has emerged as one of the most high-flying names in the generative AI race after raising $1.3bn from Microsoft and Nvidia last June. But taking up his latest position at Microsoft cements his respect in the field. Microsoft has invested billions into its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and recently in the French tech start-up Mistral AI. Microsoft said it would continue to build AI infrastructure and work in support of OpenAI's ""foundation model roadmap"". It is a different picture at Google currently though. There have been a number of issues around the tech giant's new AI-powered tool, Gemini, which refused to depict white people and changed the race of certain white historical figures. Google has apologised for ""inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions"", saying its attempts at creating a ""wide range"" of results missed the mark. If you want to know who's edging ahead on the AI race, look at the movement of its key players. Mustafa Suleyman's appointment nudges our imaginary swingometer firmly in the direction of the Seattle-based tech giant. The message could not be more clear: Microsoft""s long-term strategy of investing hugely in AI is paying off. Mr Suleyman left Google to launch his own company two years ago but until now he's remained a a high profile supporter of Team Google - or so it seemed. It must be infuriating for Google to watch. On paper Google has it all: money, expertise, infrastructure, data access and a huge user base. And yet somehow it has not found its groove, not helped by a series of PR missteps. Reports of a collaboration with its arch rival Apple, while unconfirmed by both parties, would give its AI brand Gemini a much-needed shot in the arm. But for now it finds itself increasingly sidelined in a race that, you would think, it began in pole position.",19 March 2024,tech
23,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64797355,Is TikTok really a danger to the West?,"China has attacked a bill going through US Congress that could ultimately see TikTok banned in the States, calling it unjust. It is the latest move in a years-long row over safety fears about the app which is owned by a Chinese company. Officials, politicians and security staff in many Western countries have been banned from installing it on work phones. So what are the three biggest cyber concerns about TikTok, and how does the company respond to them? TikTok says the app's data collection is ""in line with industry practices"". Critics frequently accuse TikTok of harvesting huge amounts of data. A cyber-security report published in July 2022 by researchers at Internet 2.0, an Australian cyber-company, is often cited as evidence. Researchers studied the app's source code and reported it carries out ""excessive data harvesting"". Analysts said TikTok collects details such as location, what specific device is being used and which other apps are on it. However, a similar test carried out by Citizen Lab concluded ""in comparison to other popular social media platforms, TikTok collects similar types of data to track user behaviour"". Similarly, a report by the Georgia Institute of Technology last year stated: ""The key fact here is that most other social media and mobile apps do the same things."" TikTok says the company is fully independent and ""has not provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we if asked"". Although it irks privacy experts, most of us accept that handing over swathes of private data is the deal we make with social networks. In exchange for giving us their services free of charge they gather knowledge about us and use it to sell advertising on their platform, or sell our data to other firms trying to advertise to us elsewhere on the internet. The issue that critics have with TikTok is that it is owned by Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, making it unique as a non-American mainstream app. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, for example, all collect similar amounts of data but are all US-founded companies. For years, US lawmakers, along with most of the rest of the world, have assumed a level of trust: that the data collected by these platforms will not be used for nefarious reasons which might put national security at risk. Donald Trump's 2020 executive order alleged TikTok's data collection could potentially allow China to ""track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage "". So far, evidence points to this being only a theoretical risk - but fears are stoked by a vague piece of Chinese law passed in 2017. Article seven of China's National Intelligence Law states that all Chinese organisations and citizens should ""support, assist and co-operate"" with the country's intelligence efforts. This sentence is often cited by people suspicious not just of TikTok, but all Chinese companies. However, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology argue this sentence is taken out of context, and note that the law also includes caveats protecting the rights of users and private companies. Since 2020, TikTok executives have repeatedly tried to reassure people that Chinese staff cannot access the data of non-Chinese users. But in 2022, ByteDance admitted that several of its Beijing-based employees did access the data of at least two journalists in the US and UK to track their locations and check whether they were meeting TikTok employees suspected of leaking information to the media. TikTok's spokeswoman says the employees who accessed the data were dismissed. The firm insists user data has never been stored in China and is building data centres in Texas for US user data, and at sites in Europe for data from its citizens. In the EU the company has also gone much further than any other social network and enlisted an independent cyber-security company to oversee all use of data at its European sites. TikTok says ""data of our European users is safeguarded in a specially designed protective environment, and can only be accessed by approved employees subject to strict independent oversight and verification."" TikTok argues that its community guidelines "" prohibit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public, which includes engaging in co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour"". In November 2022, Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told US lawmakers: ""The Chinese government could… control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations."" The claim has been repeated many times. Those concerns are further inflamed by the fact that TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - is heavily censored and reportedly engineered to encourage educational and wholesome material to go viral for its young user base. All social networks are heavily censored in China, with an army of internet police deleting content which criticises the government or excites political unrest. At the start of TikTok's ascendancy, there were high-profile cases of censorship on the app: a user in the US had her account suspended for discussing Beijing's treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. After a fierce public backlash, TikTok apologised and reinstated the account. Since then there have been few cases of censorship, other than the sort of controversial moderation decisions with which all platforms have to deal. Researchers at Citizen Lab carried out a comparison of TikTok and Douyin. They concluded that TikTok does not employ the same political censorship. ""The platform does not enforce obvious post censorship,"" researchers said in 2021. Georgia Institute of Technology analysts also searched for topics such as the independence of Taiwan or jokes about Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, and concluded: ""Videos in all of these categories can easily be found on TikTok. Many are popular and widely shared."" The overall picture, then, is one of theoretical fears - and theoretical risk. Critics argue TikTok is a ""Trojan horse"" - although it looks harmless, it could prove to be a powerful weapon during times of conflict, for example. The app is already banned in India, which took action in 2020 against the app and dozens of other Chinese platforms. But a US ban on TikTok could have a huge impact on the platform, since typically US allies often fall in step with such decisions. That was apparent when the US successfully led calls to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from being deployed in 5G infrastructure - again, based on theoretical risks. It is worth noting, of course, that these risks are a one-way street. China does not have to worry about US apps because access for Chinese citizens has been blocked for many years.",19 March 2024,tech
24,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68597045,Government wants flying taxis to take off in 2 years,"The first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and become a regular sight in our skies two years later, if a government announcement goes to plan. The Future of Flight action plan, developed with the aerospace industry, also says drones and other flying vehicles will become more autonomous. It predicts that the first pilotless flying taxi will take off in 2030. But experts say hurdles such as infrastructure and public acceptance need to be overcome first. There are a number of different models, but most flying taxis look like a futuristic helicopter and can usually carry about five people. They are part of a family of vehicles called ""eVTOLs"" - which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The technology for them exists now, but it is likely that the aircraft will start off as exclusive modes of transport - replacing expensive journeys currently done by helicopters. The Department for Transport also plans to allow drones to fly beyond visual line of sight - meaning the person controlling the drone cannot see it in the air. Some of the uses of unmanned drones include transporting medical supplies, delivering post in rural areas and tracking down criminals on the run. Their use is still in early stages, but the plan suggests drone deliveries would be commonplace by 2027. The biggest obstacles to getting flying taxis into the air are infrastructure and public perception, says Craig Roberts, head of drones, at consultancy firm PwC. Last year, he co-authored a report on the topic , in collaboration with the government, on the viability of the technology. ""It's challenging, but possible,"" he says of the 2026 target. Mr Roberts thinks that the most efficient use of the technology is in ""longer distance, higher occupancy cases"". The government's report gives an example of flying from Liverpool to Leeds in 26 minutes. ""It might start off as being more of a replacement for helicopters,"" he says, before demand slowly spreads to the wider population. The convenience would also have to be demonstrated to the wider public through technological advances in security screening. The PwC report assumes a scenario where it takes 10 minutes from arrival at a flying taxi rank to taking off - currently challenging, given the length of time it takes to get through a conventional airport. ""The industry knows this is a problem and knows it has to be solved... But there are technological ways of doing this,"" Mr Roberts says. ""What was holding this back for a long time was the barriers to certification of a new technology,"" says Dr Nadjim Horri, lecturer in aerospace control at the University of Leicester. However, he says that this is changing, with regulation starting to catch up with technological progress in the field. He adds that it would also require confidence from the public to adopt the new technology but that 2026 is a realistic aim to get flying taxis into the air. The proposals would require new infrastructure developments in the UK, such as ""mini airports"" for drones. A mini airport was set up for four weeks in a car park near central Coventry in 2022 as a proof of concept. The company behind it, Urban Air Port, sees the future of air taxis as additional to, rather than a replacement of, current modes of transport. Its chief executive Andrea Wu says that transport hubs should be in urban centres but ""there has not been enough investment in infrastructure"" in the UK so far. She calls the suggestion of flying taxis becoming a regular sight by 2028 an ""ambitious timeline"" given the need to build places for them to take off and land. ""But the whole industry agrees you have to put something down on paper in order to push this forward,"" Ms Wu says of Monday's announcement. No other mini airports have been built or trialled since the demonstration two years ago. But according to the government plan, the first vertiport (airport for vertical vehicles) will be operational this year. The UK's aerospace regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, is consulting on proposals for vertiports at existing aerodromes. New regulation would almost certainly need to be created if the government's aim of bringing in autonomous air taxis by 2030 is to be met.",18 March 2024,tech
25,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240314-fungi-can-be-used-to-clean-pollution-and-combat-climate-change,"In Cleveland, mushrooms digest entire houses: How fungi can be used to clean up pollution","In the struggle to combat pollution and fight climate change, a growing number of scientists are beginning to look to one of nature’s oldest biotechnologies: fungi. The city of Cleveland faces an epidemic of abandoned houses. Crumbling homes number in the thousands . These ramshackle structures are riddled with toxins like lead and dilapidated to the point of no return. And if tearing down and safely disposing of the waste of one such home sounds daunting, imagine thousands of them. Among the numerous issues that arise, one essential question involves waste. What do you do with the waste material from so many teardown structures, when so much of it is toxic? ""All of the material from demolition – the studs, the floors, cellulosic mass [the primary structural component of plants], and even things like ceiling tiles and asphalt material like roof shingles , can be mixed into substrate that then becomes good for growing fungus,"" says Chris Maurer, founder of Cleveland-based architect firm Redhouse Studio . Through his firm, Maurer has been advocating for the use of substrate to address Cleveland's housing crisis, which is also a health crisis for the city's inhabitants. Substrate is any material that mycelium – the thready, vegetative part of fungi – uses for nourishment. In other words, fungi can eat the noxious waste from the abandoned homes. Heavy metals and other toxins are extracted and captured in the mushrooms that grow, while the substrate leftovers, including the mycelium, are compacted and heated to create clean bricks for new construction. The resulting ""mycoblocks"" have a consistency akin to hardwood and, depending on the specifics of the manufacturing process, have been shown to be significantly stronger than concrete . This is Redhouse's Biocycler program, which is one of many diverse efforts around the world aiming to eliminate pollution, combat climate change, and mitigate its already-looming effects via one of nature's oldest biotechnologies: fungi. ""Effectively what we're doing is diverting tonnage from landfill,"" says Joanne Rodriguez, founder and chief executive of a similar organisation called Mycocycle , which works to recycle construction waste for corporate clients. ""[Because] 11% of the world's carbon comes from materials in the built environment. By 2027, just from Mycocyle's waste diversion, Rodriguez anticipates carbon reductions ""of close to 160,000 metric tons."" While digesting entire houses may seem like a mighty task for the humble mushroom, some species' ability to devour waste and eradicate pollutants – among other characteristics – means they present an oversized opportunity to extract harmful toxins from both our built and natural environments. Along the way they may help to address a spectrum of additional ecological concerns. This is the emerging field of mycoremediation, which researchers assert could also create a "" circular bioeconomy "" in which less waste and contaminants are produced in the first place. Its applications are abundant. In Delhi, India, the hope is that fungi will help to clean the infamously polluted air . In New Zealand, mushrooms have been used to filter oil from a canal . Operating across Europe, the LIFE MySOIL project has leveraged mycoremediation to reduce Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons in soil by 90% spanning three pilot sites. The list goes on. ""As primary decomposers in the environment, many species of fungi are designed to break down complex carbon chain molecules like wood, composed of lignin and cellulose,"" says ecologist Brendan O'Brien, executive director of CoRenewal , a bioremediation non-profit. In order to do so, they produce enzymes to break the bonds of those complex molecules, he says. ""They are therefore often able to break down other persistent organic pollutants with similar chemical structures."" Fungi have been observed breaking down pollutants such as petroleum , ""forever chemicals"" known as PFAS , herbicides, and pesticides. By sequestering and immobilising contaminants like heavy metals in their tissues, fungi can even help eliminate lead . These clean-up methods could prove a boon to ethnic minority communities who tend to be disproportionately impacted by environmental toxins . Research has shown a direct correlation between minority status and the presence of soil contamination . CoRenewal works to develop and implement sustainable solutions to restore damaged ecosystems, from post-wildfire regeneration, to cleaning up oil spills, to reducing toxins in the built environment. The organisation began with the mission of cleaning crude oil pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon using oyster mushrooms, which are well known for their ability to break down petroleum and hydrocarbons . They shifted their efforts to post-wildfire cleanup in the wake of Northern California wildfires in 2017 , applying fungal materials to prevent toxic ash runoff from entering fresh waterways and regenerate ecosystems damaged by fire. Currently they're testing the effectiveness of this treatment in five wildfire hotspots along the US' West Coast and expect to have results by early 2024. While the ability of some fungi to eliminate petroleum is well-documented , there are numerous studies underway to discover what else these mysterious mycelia can do. Their impact on PFAS, chemicals used in everyday items such as cleaning products and waterproof clothing that have been found to negatively impact our health , has been more speculative – until recently. In 2022, researchers at Texas A&M University have developed a technique that allows white rot fungus to successfully break down PFAS . ""Bioremediation is more sustainable and cost effective than many other means to treat PFAS,"" says Susie Dai, a professor of plant pathology and microbiology at Texas A&M University and one of the researchers behind the study. ""For example, thermal destruction is commercially available, but it is very energy intensive."" She points out that using heat to break down the chemicals can be more cost effective for condensed quantities of PFAS, but that ""bioremediation is more viable to be applied at larger scales"". Now, her team is searching for fungus strains that have stronger capacities to remove and break down PFAS chemicals. The elimination of these persistent, increasingly prevalent chemicals may prove to be beneficial to long-term human and environmental health. While the jury is out on precisely what risk PFAS pose to human health, ""animal model studies suggested that some PFAS may affect growth and development at large dosages"", says Dai. ""Other animal studies suggested health risks in reproduction, thyroid function, the immune system, and the liver."" And as with contaminated soil, communities of colour are more likely to be exposed to harmful levels of PFAS. The potential dangers have made the elimination of PFAS a priority among many bioremediation researchers. For another example, a research team at the University of Minnesota is currently putting together a scientific paper on its work to demonstrate that certain fungal species can ""defluorinate"" the harmful chemicals, which decreases their toxicity. ""The fluorinated carbon bond chemically is the strongest bond in the world,"" explains Jiwei Zhang, assistant professor of environment and industrial microbiology at University of Minnesota. ""That's why it's so difficult to deal with. But our research – which is still preliminary found that some fungal species can break down this resilient bond. That by itself is a fundamental achievement. Our next step is trying to understand the underlying mechanisms."" As research continues, experts are confident that the potential applications of mycoremediation will expand. ""We've only scratched the surface on the capabilities of mycelium. I think mycelium will be the unsung hero of climate change,"" predicts Rodriguez. More like this: • The world's most polluted capital city • The mushroom revolution that's bringing change • The mushrooms you can wear and build with But, warns Zhang, we would be wise to proceed with caution. ""Using fungi as a technology for remediating the environment, you might break the eco-balance because you're introducing new bio-conditions to the ecosystem. So you want to be very careful. We're culturing a lot of mushrooms right now and they're getting released into the natural forest environment, and usually the mushrooms released from farms are very competitive. They can kick out other mushrooms. It's a big concern for the conservation of natural mushroom species."" In spite of Zhang's concerns, fungi may still prove to be a boon to humanity's endeavours to live more environmentally-consciously. For example, Maurer is also experimenting with mycoremediation and mycoconstruction in Namibia, where homes built of mycoblocks offer a potential solution to the country's rampant housing crisis , which is fuelled largely by the growing issue of climate displacement. In fact, Maurer recently built what may be the first ever house constructed entirely of mycoremediated material. While working in Namibia, Maurer learned about the relationship between termites and a species of Namibian mushrooms called omajowa. The termites gather leaves in their mounds which they use to cultivate omajowa mycelium to two ends. First, the mycelium helps break down the leaf material for easier digestion. Second, it creates a humid environment through which air flows, and thanks to evaporative cooling this essentially provides an air conditioner for the mound. Each year when the omajowa mushrooms sprout from the mounds, Namibians collect and eat them. This is the perfect metaphor for various myco-efforts: collaborating with a natural, almost primordial technology for exceedingly practical purposes. Something old—older than humanity itself—becomes something new. Well, perhaps new to humans. Those mycelium-cultivating termites might beg to differ. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",16 March 2024,tech
26,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240315-iron-lung-led-to-creation-of-modern-day-intensive-care-unit,How the iron lung paved the way for the modern-day intensive care unit,"With the passing of iron lung patient Paul Alexander, a look back at how the device paved the way for subsequent life-saving medical innovations. Long before the polio vaccine , there was the iron lung . A large, cumbersome device that, by some accounts, looked like a ""coffin with legs,"" the iron lung was groundbreaking in its day. The device enabled hundreds of individuals to survive polio, a viral infection that attacks the body and can lead to paralysis and death within a matter of hours as breathing muscles become immobilised. However, with the iron lung, a massive machine that encases patients and provides air pressure to help the impacted individual's paralysed lungs function, life could continue for years. Such was the case for Paul Alexander, known globally as ""The Man in the Iron Lung"" , who died this week at the age of 78. Alexander contracted polio in 1952, when he was just six years old, leaving him paralysed from the neck down. Although he made tremendous progress learning to breathe on his own for short periods of time – he attended school and practised as a lawyer – Alexander lived the remainder of his life relying on the iron lung to survive. Developed in 1927 by a faculty member from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, industrial hygienist Philip Drinker, the iron lung was first used to save the life of a child in 1928 . It swiftly became a fixture in polio wards during the polio outbreaks of the subsequent decades, particularly from 1948 until the vaccine was developed in 1955. And its creation paved the way for many subsequent medical innovations. During the early 20th century, polio outbreaks were occurring around the world, spread via contaminated food and water. And up until the 1955 vaccine, the iron lung was the primary mode of treatment for severe cases and was considered state-of-the-art technology. A giant, airtight metal cylinder that weighs as much as 650lb (295kg) that's connected to a bellows, the iron lung requires polio patients to slide inside up to their neck. The bellows, which is attached to a pump, continuously cycles air in and out of the box, helping the patients continue breathing by sucking the chest open, forcing air to rush in to fill the lungs. This form of artificial respiration is known as External Negative Pressure Ventilation (ENPV). ""The invention of the iron lung irrevocably changed the relationship between humans and machines,"" says Hannah Wunsch, a critical care physician with Weill Cornell Medical Center Anesthesiology and author of The Autumn Ghost, a book that traces how intensive care units and mechanical ventilation are the foundation of modern medical care. ""For the first time, an individual struggling to breathe for an extended period of time could receive support, with the machine doing some or all of the work of breathing."" Some patients spent just a short time in the iron lung, perhaps weeks or months until they were able to regain chest strength and breath independently again. But for patients whose chest muscles were permanently paralysed, the iron lung remained the key to survival. While it was a lifesaving development, there were also many limitations with the iron lung for both patients and medical providers. Many patients felt trapped inside of the device, and it was difficult for doctors to access a patient's body and provide treatment to someone encased in the iron lung. But the invention, nevertheless, laid the foundation for many future medical advances. ""That concept of supporting an organ, such as the lungs, became the centrepiece of modern critical care,"" says Wunsch. The development of the iron lung is often seen as a milestone in the development of mechanical ventilators, which were not widely used prior to the polio outbreak. ""Ventilation science came into brighter lighting as a result of the iron lung,"" says Peter Gay , a pulmonary, critical care and sleep physician with the Mayo Clinic. ""The physiology of gas exchange was better understood once they mechanised moving air in and out of the body."" One of the early ventilator developments was pioneered by Bjorn Aage Ibsen. In 1953, Ibsen proposed using ""positive pressure"" ventilation. In contrast to the iron lung, which relied on negative pressure ventilation that suctioned air into a patient's lungs, positive pressure ventilation would push air into the lungs by hand, without the aid of machine. Subsequent ventilator developments, which blow air into the lungs, were more portable than the iron lung – and far less cumbersome and invasive. This type of positive pressure approach would later be used routinely in the operating room by anesthesiologists. While ventilator technology has evolved dramatically over the years and expanded, it remains very similar in concept to what was developed early on. Modern ventilators that sit at a patient's bedside delivering positive pressure in an intensive care unit can be traced back to the polio epidemic. The development of iron lung technology ""created the concept that you could put a whole lot of people into a room and support them with this life-saving gas exchange that they needed,"" adds Gay. Thus, the idea of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was born. According to the Respiratory Care Journal , ""The first ICUs were set up to manage in some cases dozens of patients, of all ages, requiring negative-pressure ventilation because of poliomyelitis [polio]."" ""You had these units with all of these polio patients using the iron lung, and that's where the idea of intensive care units really took off,"" continues Gay. ""That's why anesthesiologists initially became the critical care experts. Because anesthesiologists were largely the first to administer this type of intensive care."" More like this: • The drug pilots take to stay awake • Women's fertility is more complicated than you might have heard • What can you absorb through your skin? Wunsch concurs, pointing out that ""creating respiratory centres for the care of polio patients supported by iron lungs helped cement the idea that complex care of patients required a dedicated area, with highly skilled caregivers. This concept is also very much at the heart of modern ICUs."" Equally important, the ability to support a patient’s respiratory system more effectively has allowed for better treatment of many other critical illnesses. ""So often, when people have critical illness, respiratory failure accompanies the illness – when patients are septic, or have pneumonia or infections – the respiratory system has to be supported in order for any other organ failure to be recovered,"" adds Gay. Polio was feared around the world at the peak of its epidemic. The disease left hundreds of thousands of children paralysed each year. The iron lung helped save many of them: In the United States alone, it was used by 1,200 people in 1959. Fast-forward to late 2019 and early 2020, and the world one again found itself grappling with a frightening disease. During the Covid-19 pandemic peak, ventilation was once again at the forefront of treatment. Most recently, a team of engineers and doctors has invented the modern version of the iron lung – technology that serves as a breathing aid for patients with Covid-19. The new device, which is still in development and has not yet been brought to market, is named Exovent NPV. It is also a negative pressure ventilator, and works by decreasing ""the pressure outside the body to allow lung tissue to expand and function in a way that resembles normal breathing,"" according to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. There is also hope that the device may be used to help with conditions such as pneumonia. The Exovent is merely the latest example of a medical innovation that can trace its roots back to the invention of the iron lung. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",15 March 2024,tech

The class action alleged the tech giant's boss, Tim Cook, defrauded shareholders by covering up lower demand for iPhones in China. The council said a pension fund it administered lost money as a result of Mr Cook's actions. In a statement, the Norfolk Pension Fund said it was ""very proud of this recovery for investors"". The statement continued: ""We are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals. ""When and where it's warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants' investments are harmed by fraud."" The BBC has approached Apple for comment. The class action lawsuit - meaning it is on behalf of a group of claimants - centred around comments made by Apple's chief executive Tim Cook. He told investors on 1 November 2018 that there was ""sales pressure"" in some countries but he ""would not put China in that category"". However, two months later, on 2 January 2019, Apple downgraded its quarterly revenue forecast, citing tensions between China and the US - leading to a sharp drop in Apple's share price. Within that two-month window, reports emerged that Apple had told its top smartphone assemblers to ""halt plans for additional production lines"" for the recently released iPhone XR. The claimants in this case were all investors who had bought shares between November 2018 and January 2019. They said they lost money because they had been falsely reassured by Mr Cook's comments in November. The case was originally brought against Apple and Mr Cook by the US city of Roseville. Norfolk County Council, which administers the £4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020. Apple had fought the litigation, and a trial was scheduled for later this year. This preliminary settlement - filed on Friday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California - should mean that will no longer happen, however it still requires approval by a judge. It is not known what portion of the settlement Norfolk County Council will receive. Apple posted $97 billion of net income in the last fiscal year. The pay-out equals a little under two days of profit for what is one of the world's wealthiest companies.",15 March 2024,tech
28,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117,"Why does the US want to ban TikTok, and when could it happen?","US politicians are debating new legislation which would ban TikTok in the US unless its Chinese owners sell the company. The video sharing app has millions of users around the world, but is facing questions over the security of users' data, and its links to the government in Beijing. Politicians from both major US parties have introduced a new bill which would ban TikTok unless owner ByteDance agrees to sell the app to a non-Chinese company. The lawmakers fear that the Chinese government could use security laws to force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government. The US House of Representatives passed the bill on 13 March , with 352 voting in favour of the proposed law and 65 against. It now moves to the Senate, where it is likely to face rigorous scrutiny. It is not clear whether a majority of senators will approve the bill. US president Joe Biden says he will sign the bill into law if it is approved by the Senate. This is the latest attempt by the American authorities to curb TikTok. Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020. But Mr Trump - now confirmed as the Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook. The bill still has some way to go before it becomes law. But if it passes the Senate and is signed into law by President Biden, ByteDance would have six months to sell TikTok before any ban would take effect. The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices. App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. The bill also forbids ""foreign adversary controlled applications"" from being updated and maintained in the US. That means people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. TikTok has been highly critical of the legislation. Chief executive Shou Zi Chew warned the bill would give ""more power to a handful of other social media companies"", and put thousands of American jobs at risk. ByteDance would have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move. Some US creators and users have also criticised the proposed ban. Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work. TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill. But the deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators may have backfired. Several politicians say the campaign has worsened the concerns they have about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation. If the bill becomes US law, it could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears. At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm. This is a set of instructions within the app which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You. The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app. This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral. Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system. This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing. But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users.",14 March 2024,tech
29,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68567320,Judge rules computer scientist not Bitcoin inventor,"The judge overseeing a legal battle about who invented Bitcoin has ruled that it is not Australian computer scientist Craig Wright. The question had been examined in a five week trial at the High Court. The judge, Mr Justice Mellor, made his ruling as soon as the proceedings had concluded. He had been expected to retire to consider the case but said he was able to reach a decision so quickly because the ""evidence was overwhelming"". Bitcoin is the world's best known cryptocurrency - and has recently captured the headlines after surging to a new record high valuation. But the identity of the person or people who invented it has always been unknown, other than they go by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Dr Wright, who is from Australia, has claimed to be Satoshi since 2016 - but his claims and evidence to back them up have long been questioned by cryptocurrency experts. He has been in and out of court for years in legal battles with individuals who challenged his story. This case, heard at the Intellectual Property Court, a division of London's High Court, was brought by a group of Bitcoin companies. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) - whose members include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's payments firm, Block - accused Dr Wright of creating a chilling effect on the development of the cryptocurrency because of his aggressive legal cases. During the hearing, COPA's legal team said Dr Wright had carried out a ""a massive campaign of dishonesty and forgery"". It even accused him of forging fresh documents while the proceedings were ongoing. COPA's lawyer, Jonathan Hough, said elements of Dr Wight's conduct ""stray into farce"" - but he told the court it also had ""deadly serious"" consequences. ""On the basis of his dishonest claim to be Satoshi, he has pursued claims he puts at hundreds of billions of dollars, including against numerous private individuals,"" he told the trial. Throughout the trial Dr Wright's legal team argued that if he was not the inventor then the real Satoshi Nakamoto would have come forward to discredit him. Mr Justice Mellor agreed that Dr Wright was not who he said he was. ""Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto"", he told the court. ""Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system."" He said he would give a full written judgement in due course.",14 March 2024,tech
30,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68547574,AI weapons scanner Evolv backtracks on UK testing claims,"An AI weapons-scanning company has backtracked on claims its technology has been tested by the UK government. Evolv Technology makes ""intelligent"" scanners designed to replace metal detectors by identifying people with concealed guns, knives and bombs. But the company has come under mounting criticism for overstating what the technology can deliver. Evolv told BBC News it had altered its claims about UK testing to ""better reflect the process taken"". The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into the company last month. And in October the company revealed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was looking into its marketing practices. As well as in many large stadiums and hundreds of schools in the US, Evolv scanners are used in the Manchester Arena. The company had said that its AI weapons scanner had been tested by the UK Government's National Protective Security Authority (NPSA) On 20 February the company put out a press release, including a claim that the NPSA was one of a number of testers who had ""concluded that the Evolv Express solution was highly effective at detecting firearms and many other types of weapons"". But BBC News can reveal the NPSA does not do this type of testing. When BBC News put this to Evolv, the company said: ""After discussion with NPSA, we updated the language used in the February 20 press release to better reflect the process taken."" Instead, it said: an independent company had ""tested and validated"" Evolv's technology, using NPSA standards. But the UK company that did this testing, Metrix NDT, told BBC News it was ""not correct to say we 'validated' the system"". Metrix NDT managing director Nick Fox told BBC News that Evolv's system had indeed been tested against NPSA specifications. But when asked if Metrix NDT had found it ""highly effective at detecting firearms and many other types of weapons"", he said: ""It is not within our remit to pass any value judgements on the results."" Evolv told the BBC that in addition to those results, Evolv makes available to any serious prospective customer full third-party testing reports for detection performance. Prof Marion Oswald, who was on the government's Centre of Data Ethics and Innovation advisory board until last year, told BBC News it was worrying the technology was replacing ""tried and tested"" security options. ""It does highlight the need for really close scrutiny and potential additional regulation of companies making these types of claims,"" she told BBC News. And she worried how customers might be influenced, ""especially if claims are being made about how certain government bodies may have been involved"". Evolv has previously said its technology detects the ""signatures"" of concealed weapons. ""Metallic composition, shape, fragmentation - we have tens of thousands of these signatures, for all the weapons that are out there,"" chief executive Peter George said, in 2021, ""all the guns, all the bombs and all the large tactical knives."" But the company has faced criticism it cannot reliably detect knives or bombs. Evolv now says it can detect ""many types of knives and some explosives"". In 2022, following a Freedom of Information request by the security-analysis company Internet Protocol Video Market (IPVM), BBC News revealed that testing by a US facility had found Evolv's technology could not consistently detect knives and certain types of bombs. Evolv should inform potential clients, the testers said. But during that investigation, in August 2022, Evolv had also told BBC News the NPSA (then called the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure CPNI) had tested its system. ""We have tested with the UK CPNI,"" a representative told BBC News. A Home Office official said: ""We are looking to further understand the capabilities of weapons-detection equipment."" Evolv also amended another claim in its 20 February press release.  Evolv had initially referred to the designation of its technology under the US Department of Homeland Security Safety (DHS) Act as an example of recent ""third party testing"". This was later changed so as to reflect the fact that this designation does not involve the conduct of a new test by the DHS but is an evaluation of other evidence. In May last year, BBC News revealed further details of a stabbing in a New York school that used Evolv scanners. Proctor High School's then superintendent, Brian Nolan, said: ""Through investigation, it was determined the Evolv Weapon Detection System… was not designed to detect knives."" The victim is suing Evolv and the scanners were replaced by 10 metal detectors. The company has changed the front of its website many times. Initially claiming its goal was to create ""weapons-free zones"", the website now says its mission is to create ""safer experiences"". Last year, the company said it regretted any confusion around the capabilities of its technology. ""We wholeheartedly believe in our technology and our mission and deeply regret if any of our past statements confused or appeared to generalise our capabilities at the time,"" it said. But questions remain as to what Evolv has previously told customers its technology is capable of and the testing it has gone through.",14 March 2024,tech
31,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68546450,MEPs approve world's first comprehensive AI law,"The European Parliament has approved the world's first comprehensive framework for constraining the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). The sector has seen explosive growth - driving huge profits but also stoking fears about bias, privacy and even the future of humanity . The AI Act works by classifying products according to risk and adjusting scrutiny accordingly. The law's creators said it would make the tech more ""human-centric."" ""The AI act is not the end of the journey but the starting point for new governance built around technology,"" MEP Dragos Tudorache added. It also places the EU at the forefront of global attempts to address the dangers associated with AI. China already has introduced a patchwork of AI laws. In October 2023, US President Joe Biden announced an executive orde r requiring AI developers to share data with the government. But the EU has now gone further. ""The adoption of the AI Act marks the beginning of a new AI era and its importance cannot be overstated,"" said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester. ""The EU AI Act is the world's first and only set of binding requirements to mitigate AI risks,"" she added. She said it would make the EU the ""de facto"" global standard for trustworthy AI, leaving every other region, including the UK, to ""play catch-up."" In November 2023, the UK hosted an AI safety summit but is not planning legislation along the lines of the AI Act. The main idea of the law is to regulate AI based on its capacity to cause harm to society. The higher the risk, the stricter the rules. AI applications that pose a ""clear risk to fundamental rights"" will be banned, for example some of those that involve the processing of biometric data. AI systems considered ""high-risk"", such as those used in critical infrastructure, education, healthcare, law enforcement, border management or elections, will have to comply with strict requirements. Low-risk services, such as spam filters, will face the lightest regulation - the EU expects most services to fall into this category. The Act also creates provisions to tackle risks posed by the systems underpinning generative AI tools and chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. These would require producers of some so-called general-purpose AI systems, that can be harnessed for a range of tasks, to be transparent about the material used to train their models and to comply with EU copyright law. Mr Turodache told reporters ahead of the vote that copyright provisions had been one of the ""heaviest lobbied"" parts of the bill. OpenAI, Stability AI and graphics chip giant Nvidia are among a handful of AI firms facing lawsuits over their use of data to train generative models. Some artists, writers and musicians have argued the process of ""scraping"" huge volumes of data, including potentially their own works, from virtually all corners of the internet violates copyright laws. The Act still has to pass several more steps before it formally becomes law. Lawyer-linguists, whose job is to check and translate laws, will scour its text and the European Council - composed of representatives of EU member states - will also need to endorse it, though that is expected to be a formality. In the meantime, businesses will be working out how to comply with the legislation. Kirsten Rulf - a former advisor to the German government, and now a partner at Boston Consulting Group - says more than 300 firms have been in touch with her company so far. ""They want to know how to scale the tech, and get value from AI,"" she told the BBC. ""Businesses need and want the legal certainty.""",13 March 2024,tech
32,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68543677,Sail-powered cargo ship 'shows potential of wind',"Retrofitting giant, rigid sails to a cargo ship has effectively cut its fuel use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, shipping firm data shows. The Pyxis Ocean tested the British-designed WindWings for six months. Cargill says the data ""underscores the potential"" of wind to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint. Experts describe the results as ""very encouraging"", but say, at present, only a tiny volume of the international shipping fleet is using the technology. Sails have powered boats for millennia - but the type of sails trialled on the Pyxis Ocean are different to those normally seen on wind-powered vessels. Made of the same material as wind turbine blades, they are folded down in port then opened out to stand at 123ft (37.5m) on the open seas. After having the wings fitted in Shanghai, the ship set sail in August 2023. Cargill says the ship spent half a year sailing the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the North and South Atlantic, during which time it used on average three tonnes less fuel each day. That equates to 11.2 tonnes of C02 emissions saved for each day the sails were up. If replicated over a year, it would amount to the equivalent of removing 480 cars from the roads, Cargill calculates. The saving, though, is a drop in the ocean for the industry as a whole. International shipping is estimated to be responsible for 837 million tonnes of CO2 annually - or 2.1% of total global emissions. Nonetheless, Cargill says it is encouraged by the results. ""We believe technologies that harness the wind could be an important, cost-effective way to achieve our decarbonisation goals in the short, medium and long-term,"" said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill's Ocean Transportation business. The company says it is ""engaging"" with more than 250 ports worldwide to find ways for ships fitted with the sails to berth. BAR Technologies, the UK firm which designed the wings, is seeking other ships to fit, and says it will use three wings rather than two in future, increasing the fuel and emissions saved. Stephen Gordon, managing director at the maritime data firm Clarksons Research, highlighted the fact that this trial had taken place with a refurbished, rather than a brand new ship. ""The option to retrofit to an existing fleet - as has been done with the Pyxis Ocean - is very helpful,"" he told the BBC. ""It will take decades to deliver all the new ships needed for the decarbonisation journey. Even today shipyards globally are full and lead times for delivery are averaging 3.5 years."" Mr Gordon said other firms were exploring alternative energy-saving technologies, such as flettner rotors - a system of spinning cylinders first conceived 100 years ago and now enjoying a limited renaissance . But he stressed that the international shipping fleet and newbuild order-book stood at 114,000 vessels - and his company only had records of 100 of them having wind-assisted technology. Dr Simon Bullock, from the University of Manchester's Tyndall Centre, said it was time for that that to change. He said the results showed the ""major and immediate benefits of wind-assist technologies"" and urged other shipping companies to take note. ""To tackle climate change, the shipping industry needs to cut its use of fossil fuel rapidly. ""These essential technologies make major inroads into that challenge, and should be deployed and retrofitted as standard,"" he told the BBC.",13 March 2024,tech

The social media company, which has never made a profit, will float shares on the New York Stock Exchange. A filing in the US revealed that Reddit and its investors are hoping to sell 22 million shares for between $31 and $34 each. However, many users worry the move will fundamentally change the website. Some shares will be specially reserved for some Reddit users and moderators. The company is planning an initial public offering (IPO) which would make some of its shares publicly available to buy for the first time. ""Our users have a deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit,"" wrote co-founder Steve Huffman in a letter to prospective investors released a few weeks ago. ""We want this sense of ownership to be reflected in real ownership - for our users to be our owners. Becoming a public company makes this possible."" Reddit, which was founded almost 20 years ago, is an online forum where users can post questions and comment on topics that interest them. The company makes most of its money through advertising on the platform, although it recently struck a deal with Google which allows the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. Reddit has recorded losses every year since its start, including more than $90m last year. The valuation is also far less than the $10bn at which it was valued in a private fundraising round in 2021. Currently, the biggest shareholders include media company Advance Magazine Publishers, Chinese tech firm Tencent, US investment firm Fidelity, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT makers OpenAI. Reddit, founded in 2005, has a different feel compared with other social media companies such as Facebook or TikTok. Users often feel freer to write what they like, although subreddits are policed by moderators. The power of Reddit communities has been seen through examples such as the Gamestop saga in 2021, where users mobilised to drive up the share price of the US video game retailer. Shares which were initially worth $20 shot up to a peak of $350 after co-ordination from Redditors. However, some users are worried that the IPO would change the site for the worse. ""When the most important customers shift from [users] to shareholders, the product always [suffers],"" said one person. ""It becomes 'what can we do this quarter to squeak out an additional point of revenue', instead of 'how can we make this product better'.""",11 March 2024,tech
34,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240311-how-to-spot-a-manipulated-image,How to spot a manipulated image,"Amid allegations that an official photograph of the Princess of Wales had been ""manipulated"", here are some clues that can help you identify if an image has been altered or faked. In a world where pictures can be digitally altered with just a few clicks or even generated entirely from scratch by artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming ever harder to trust what our eyes see. The techniques used to manipulate images are so sophisticated that we have entered the era of the hyper-realistic fake. Such images can lead to the spread of misinformation and could even influence public opinion in important events such as elections . With a picture of the Princess of Wales and her children being withdrawn by news agencies amid concerns it had been ""manipulated "", the issue has been thrown into the spotlight like never before. The Princess of Wales later apologised for making the changes to the image, stating that ""like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing"". ( Learn more about how Kate's photo may have been altered in this analysis from BBC Verify . ) But is there anything we can do to spot an image that might have been altered or AI generated? Abnormal lighting is often a giveaway that a photograph has been altered. Check the points of light in people's eyes , for example; the source of light will often be reflected in their eyes. If the size and colour don't match with the location, or if they look different between the eyes, then you might have cause to be suspicious. The way subjects and objects appear in reflective surfaces in an image can also provide clues. Shadows of objects in the image may not line up if it has been pieced together from multiple pictures, although bear in mind that some pictures can be taken with multiple lighting sources. It's worth looking at the way light plays across a subject's face. If the Sun is behind them, for example, their ears might look red. Artificial intelligence can also produce incongruent lighting and shadows, but as algorithms improve, AI-generated faces are often perceived as being more real than human faces . Another tell-tale approach is to look for features that are hard to replicate. AI is currently poor at rendering hands and ears , mangling their shapes, proportions and even the number of fingers. These are the same features that often trouble artists, but as other aspects of AI-generated images of people become hyper-real, these inaccuracies create an uncanny valley that looks unnatural to our eyes. You might also like: Look out for unusual or unnatural positioning of limbs or clothing in an image, which can be a sign that a portion of it has been copied or manipulated in some way. But also remember that the flattening of the three dimensional world into a two dimensional image can make things look a little out of place at times too. One test to apply is to look at other elements of the image in the same field of focus and position. Do they look blurry compared to other features nearby in the same depth in the photograph , or are they being ruffled by a breeze in the same way? Hidden within the code of digital images are nuggets of information that can help to pinpoint a fake. Every time a digital camera snaps an image, metadata is written into the image file. Timestamps, for example, led to questions about whether President Donald Trump was in fact at work in the White House the day after revealing he had caught Covid-19 in October 2020. Every digital camera sensor features tiny manufacturing faults that lead to unique errors that leave a kind of ""fingerprint"" on pictures . This is then associated with a specific camera and can help to identify areas of a photograph that have been manipulated . The grain of an AI-generated image can also look peculiar . Internet companies such as Google have launched image verification tools that can help people to spot AI-generated images. Facebook and Instagram have started labelling AI-generated images that come from Meta's own systems and is planning to do the same for pictures generated by other companies' AI tools . -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

35,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68517246,Apple 'like The Godfather' with new App Store rules,"This week Apple made the long-awaited landmark move to allow other companies to launch app stores on iPhones. The tech giant was forced to act by EU politicians concerned about it having a market monopoly. The decision is being watched closely around the world and was initially celebrated as an industry victory for businesses and consumers in the EU. But Apple's strict new rules and fees are being heavily criticised, with Spotify calling them ""extortion"". It is one of many companies, including Fortnite maker Epic Games, that has been pushing Apple to allow alternative app stores on iPhones. The EU lawmakers hoped their rule change would encourage smaller challengers to enter the lucrative iPhone market. ""Apple says it's opening up, but it still has a tight fist around iPhones"", says Colton Adamski, a former hacker and businessman who lives near Chicago and is trying to launch one of the first alternative app shops in the EU. The 22-year-old has been running an unofficial iPhone app store for more than six years. It is, in his words, a ""grey business"" operating on the fringes of what is legal. For everywhere other than the EU, starting an app store is against Apple's terms, and installing apps outside the official App Store is prohibited. The process, known as side-loading, is common practice on Android phones, but Apple has forbidden it since launching the iPhone, arguing it is a security risk. Apps need to be verified through the official App Store, the tech giant has long said. Apple charges an average 30% commission to apps using its store, which it says is for the protection of consumers. Although the fee is controversial, it is true that generally Apple is more successful at keeping malicious apps out than other marketplaces like Google's Play Store. Colton's app shop has attracted hundreds of thousands of downloads of unofficial apps and games. The BBC tried his service and was able to download apps to an iPhone through a simple workaround that changes the phone settings to override security warnings. He has made a decent living operating his under-the-radar app shop, but has long wished to make one legitimately. So when the EU's new laws were announced in January, he jumped at the chance. ""It was so exciting we finally had the opportunity to go from a 'grey' store operating in the margins of what's allowed to finally launching a legit store,"" he says. Apple is now the biggest smartphone seller globally and has the most affluent user base, so getting his store on to iPhones would be a major win. Colton's excitement diminished though when he and his team started reading Apple's terms and conditions. He compares Apple's rules to a gangster from The Godfather or Sopranos. Yes, you can open your shop on their turf, but you have to do exactly as they say or they will shut you down. Apple insists that new app shops have €1m (£851,000) in the bank, but if their reserves dip below that figure, they can be closed down. Apple did not respond to our questions about why this is needed, but has previously said it is about weeding out dodgy, or scam, stores. In the last few weeks, since Colton secured his line of credit, Apple has said that app developers of ""good standing"" for at least two years can also build an app shop without the €1m. Colton's next hurdle to overcome is how to make a profit. Apple automatically bills new app stores half a euro for every download after one million. Apple says this Core Technology Fee is about keeping iPhones safe through security updates. But Colton feels this is like a so-called protection fee paid to a mob under the guise of making sure a shop owner's business is safe. So if someone downloads his app shop app but never uses it, he still has to pay Apple 50 cents. Apple is also applying the 50 cent fee to individual apps that receive more than a million downloads, which is worrying some popular app makers. The company has created a website where app developers can estimate how much money they would owe Apple if they choose to list their apps on other stores. It could total thousands if the million download figure is passed, but if they sold exclusively through Apple's App Store it would cost nothing. Another charge being criticised is the 17% fee Apple will charge on any sales of an app sold on its App Store and elsewhere. Apple argues that 99% of apps it currently hosts are small enough that they can reduce or maintain their current fees. ""Ultimately, we want developers to have the flexibility to choose the business terms that make the most sense for them,"" a spokeswoman said. But, according to Colton, just like The Godfather, Apple is making companies an offer they cannot refuse to keep them listing only on the App Store. ""Many app developers I know are angry and upset. How on earth can they explain this Core Technology Fee? We don't see Android pulling that nonsense,"" Colton says. Android phones, running Google software, have historically been more open, allowing other app shops to exist like Samsung Galaxy Store and Huawei AppGallery. But Google's own app shop - Google Play - is by far the most dominant player and, like Apple's App Store, charges apps on average 30% of their profits or subscriptions as commission. EU lawmakers who created the Digital Markets Act have not yet given an opinion on Apple's alternative app store rules, and say they will assess them once they are seen in practice. For now, Colton says he is determined to make his app store work. ""It's proving to be really tough but me and my team are working hard because this is literally the future of iPhones,"" he said.",10 March 2024,tech
36,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68514718,Craig Phillips: TV star shaken after Jaguar brakes fail during drive,"Craig Phillips, former winner of the reality TV show Big Brother, has described his fear when the brakes failed on his Jaguar I-Pace electric vehicle while he was driving. It is the second report of the brakes failing on this particular model while in motion. Mr Phillips said it was ""terrifying"" to feel ""out of control"" of the vehicle while his family were also inside. Jaguar said it was investigating and took both claims seriously. Earlier this week , another I-Pace driver claimed to have found himself unable to brake on a motorway as the car accelerated and had to be flanked by police. ""Following the incident involving a Jaguar I-Pace on the M62 on the afternoon of 6th March, we are looking into this matter with urgency,"" Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said. ""A full review is underway to determine the cause of this incident, which is still yet to be established. The safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority."" It said it was also taking Mr Phillips' claims seriously. Mr Phillips' experience, first reported by the Daily Mail, happened on New Year's Eve 2023. He told BBC News: ""In the afternoon, I'd set off from home with my wife and kids in the back of the car. I'd barely gone a mile from home and as I came to traffic lights, travelling at about 30mph, three cars away from the lights I could not brake. ""I was pushing on the pedal, but the hydraulic felt like it was pushing my foot up. My whole body was locked up trying to push down on the brake."" He said fortunately the lights then changed from red as he could not have physically stopped. ""I immediately returned home really slowly. I didn't want to go above 10 to 15mph. I would not want anyone else to be in the same situation, particularly with children in the back."" He had owned the car for more than three years and has now returned it. He called for a full recall of the model by Jaguar as a safety precaution. A Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said: ""We are taking these recent claims by Mr Phillips very seriously and are looking into his complaint. In addition we are concerned to hear that Mr Phillips may not have received the high levels of care to which we hold ourselves accountable. ""Our client experience as well as the safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority."" Like many electric vehicles, the Jaguar I-Pace offers regenerative braking, in which the energy created as the car brakes is re-captured and sent back to the battery. Thousands of the cars have been sold in the UK since 2018, which cost nearly £70,000. In 2019, some Jaguar I-Pace vehicles were recalled in North America because of a fault with the system. Jaguar was already due to end production of the I-Pace, which was its first electric car, next year.",8 March 2024,tech

The company says it fell victim to the suspected ransomware attack ""during the night from Tuesday to Wednesday."" Initially, five of its production facilities were shut down - one has since come back online. Duvel said it was currently unable to give further details ""as the investigation into the cause of the cyber-attack is ongoing."" ""The built-in command systems and alarms in the IT-system worked well, so our IT department was immediately informed of the attack,"" the company said in a statement. ""The servers were immediately shut down, which also shut down production at the four Belgian production sites and the production site in Kansas City."" Duvel said that one plant, in Puurs-Sint-Amands in Belgium, was now back up and running, but production at the other four was still halted. Duvel, which also produces beers such as Chouffe, Vedett and Liefmans, was founded in 1871 and made €583m (£497m) in revenue in 2022. That year it produced around 230 million litres of beer. It is not yet known whether the supply of its products will be affected by this incident. The company told local media that it was a ransomware attack.

38,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68478486,Bafta Games Awards 2024: Baldur's Gate 3 and Spider-Man lead nods,"Baldur's Gate 3 leads the way in this year's Bafta Games Awards nominations with a total of 10. As well as being in the running for best game, the actors behind popular characters Karlach and Astarion are among those up for solo awards. Sony's hit sequel Spider-Man 2 received nine nods, closely followed by Alan Wake 2, with eight. Elsewhere, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor have six nominations each. This year will be the twentieth anniversary of the awards - one of the most prestigious nights in the calendar for the gaming industry - and will be held on 11 April 2024. Last year gaming sales topped £4.7bn in the UK , more than double that of the music industry, according to the digital entertainment and retail association (ERA). Samantha Béart, nominated for her performance as Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, said it felt ""absolutely incredible"" to be up for the Performer in a Leading Role award. ""It's great to be noticed, and this year there were so many great performances,"" she said. ""What an achievement, and with so many of us in the category as well - I'm so chuffed for everyone. ""Of those that didn't make it - I will avenge them all!"" Both Baldur's Gate and Zelda were smash hits with critics, and rank among the 30 highest-rated games of all time, according to review aggregator Metacritic . They will compete in the Best Game category alongside Spider-Man 2, with Alan Wake 2, Super Mario Bros Wonder and surprise hit Dave the Diver making up the games in the running for the top award. ""It's likely that 2023 will go down in history as one of the best years for new video game releases,"" said Bafta Games committee head Tara Saunders. ""There was a steady stream of new, creative, imaginative work that's been pouring out of some of the best and brightest developers in the business. ""I don't know what was in the air, but there is some magic in there."" The shortlist was narrowed down from a longlist of 60 games , which was announced in December. The awards are decided by specially selected juries, but in a change from previous years, the Best Game and Best British Game awards are voted on by more than 1,200 Bafta members - professionals with years of experience in gaming. They will have the difficult task of choosing the winners in a year which saw gamers spoiled for choice. 2023's surprise hit Baldur's Gate 3, based on Dungeons and Dragons, has already won the top award at the 2023 Game Awards . As well as Best Game it has been nominated in the Music and Artistic Achievement categories at the Bafta Games Awards, and five of its performers are up for individual golden masks. ""We're thrilled for the entire team that helped bring Baldur's Gate 3 to life, and the prestigious recognition that comes with these eight category nominations,"" the game's director Swen Vincke told the BBC. ""It's a hugely motivating force helping us to move forward with even greater enthusiasm."" Meanwhile, both Nintendo and Sony have had games nominated that broke sales records in 2023 - with Tears of the Kingdom shipping 10m units in three days , and Spider-Man 2 becoming the fastest-selling game made by PlayStation . Spider-Man has three voice actors up for individual awards, while it is also nominated in the Game Design and Technical Achievement categories. It will compete with Zelda in those two categories, while Nintendo's game also has nominations for the Music and Audio Achievement awards. The battle for Best Game may come down to Baldur's Gate, Zelda and Spider-Man, but Bafta has been known to throw up a surprise or two before - with last year's awards being no exception. In 2023, the gong was taken by indie game Vampire Survivors, while mystery title What Remains of Edith Finch won in 2018. That means the developers of Dave the Diver might have reason to be hopeful their unexpected fishing and sushi-restaurant-managing hit could take home the big prize. Meanwhile, studios across the length of the UK make up the nominees for the Best British Game category, with Brighton-based Bytten Studio nominated for Cassette Beasts, and Scottish studio Sad Owl nominated for Viewfinder. And Football Manager 2024 is also up for an award in the category following the release of the 20th game in the best-selling series . ""It's really inspiring to see that in the Game Design, Debut Game and the Game Beyond Entertainment categories there is a strong presence of indie game titles, such as Tchia, Cocoon and Venba,"" said UK publisher No More Robots production director Sophie Smart. ""It really shows that despite the difficulties in the industry right now with layoffs, there is still a deep appreciation for games made by all sorts of teams and it's great to see Bafta recognising that."" Elsewhere, Nadji Jeter and Yuri Lowenthal and have received nods for their performances as Miles Morales and Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2. While Amelia Tyler, Neil Newborn, Samantha Béart, Andrew Wincott and Tracy Wiles are the five nominated for their performances in Baldur's Gate 3. ""What's interesting about the performance categories is you see established actors like Ralph Ineson (Cid in Final Fantasy XVI) and Tony Todd (Venom in Spider-Man 2) and then you've got newcomers in there,"" said Bafta's executive director of awards and content Emma Baehr. ""11 of the 12 are first-time nominees - we're showcasing and celebrating them for the first time.""

39,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68500945,Pornhub challenges EU over online content rules,"One of the world's most popular pornography websites, Pornhub, is contesting new EU rules. The adult site is facing new obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), including strict requirements on age verification. The new rules apply to what the EU designates a Very large Online Platform (VLOP) - which Pornhub says it is not. ""We believe the European Commission erred in its calculation of our user numbers"", the firm said. The challenge was filed to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg on March 1 for Pornhub by its owner, the Canada-based Aylo. Technius, the parent firm of another adult site, Stripchat, has also registered a case, as has WebGroup Czech Republic, which operates XVideos. To be designated a VLOP, a site needs to be visited by more than 45 million Europeans on average every month - a threshold the EU says Pornhub meets. ""The Commission stands fully behind its calculations of the user numbers of Pornhub and Stripchat,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. But Aylo says as of January 31, 2024, Pornhub had 32 million monthly active users - so it is filing an application to have its VLOP status annulled. It said it looked forward to the facts ""being fully and fairly aired"" in court. The DSA aims to give people in the EU greater protections online, with VLOPs facing what the European Commission calls more ""diligent content moderation."" Among its measures are new responsibilities to take down illegal content, such as non-consensual videos. Sites can also be asked to have a publicly accessible database of advertisements - a requirement Aylo says it considers ""illegal"". The platforms are expected to give detailed plans by April 20 about how they limit major risks like violence against women and protection of minors. Breaching the new law can lead to fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover. The websites' owners had until this month to contest the decisions. The DSA is not only the piece of European legislation causing tech companies headaches. From Thursday, six big firms - designated ""gatekeepers"" by the EU - face new responsibilities under the Digitial Markets Act (DMA). But one of them, Apple, has already run into controversy. It has barred Fortnite-maker, Epic Games, from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe. One of the DMA's objectives is to open up big tech app stores to more competition. The EU says it will now question Apple about its decision.",7 March 2024,tech
40,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68466369,Police worried 101 call bot would struggle with 'Brummie' accents,"West Midlands Police trialled a voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in a bid to deal with rising volumes of non-emergency calls. Sensitive technical details of the plan were erroneously published online in a document seen by the BBC. It set out potential risks of the AI, including whether the system, dubbed ""Amy101"", would understand local ""Brummie"" accents. West Midlands Police has insisted ""robust safeguards"" were in place. Based on the tech behind Amazon's popular voice assistant, Alexa, the trial explored how AI could help the force cope with increasing volumes of calls, and potentially offer new services such as responses in different languages. A document detailing the plan was mistakenly posted online by the office of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC). The document, marked ""official sensitive"" and with warnings that it was ""not to be publicly disclosed"", has since been removed. Amy101 was designed to speak or text-chat in order to deal with callers' inquiries and was expected to handle about 200 calls per day. The project, a two month proof-of-concept trial, was nationally funded. It was - the document suggested - the first such project where an AI-powered tool would speak to callers, though other forces were also exploring uses of the tech. Amy101 had the ability to prioritise vulnerable callers, by looking out for certain keywords - such as those referencing domestic violence - and ensuring they were next-in-line to be dealt with by a human call operator, the document says. Through speech or text chat it could direct calls, provide advice on issues such as reporting criminal damage, or requesting a crime update. West Midlands Police told the BBC the trial began on 19 December 2023 and had now concluded. Its director of commercial services, Peter Gillett, said - by the time the trial started - the force had already improved and was now ""one of the top-performing police forces for managing emergency and non-emergency calls"". The document - prepared for an ethical oversight committee that advises the PCC and Chief Constable - reveals the potential problems that might arise with Amy101, including whether the tech could cope with the local accent. ""Bias will naturally occur within the ""Amy"" system based on accents/localisation - for example can she understand ""Brummie"" accents? And are they treated with equal weighting to different accents in English?"" the document asks. Because Alexa is used globally - coping with a range of accents and languages - it was hoped that this type of bias had been removed. And if calls were not understood they would be transferred to the queue for a human operator. Mr Gillett said the force recognised that technologies capable of understanding ordinary language were ""not flawless"", and therefore may struggle with accents. As a result the force used a ""large-scale"" system ""to mitigate this bias"". Potential issues around safeguarding data were also flagged, including the risk calls would be used to help train the Amazon AI system, called Lex V2, behind Amy101. Some calls could include personally identifiable information. The document provides the example, ""My name is Marc and I want to report my house was broken into….."". The police can, however, opt-out of this kind of training and will do this ""where viable"", the document says. The ethics committee also had a number of questions, recorded in its minutes , about Amy101, such as the voice and ""gendered name"" of the tool. The force responded arguing ""humanisation"" was needed. It also suggested officers requested further analysis from Amazon on potential issues ""such as regional accent recognition and bias testing"". It is not clear whether the concerns raised in the document ever materialised, though police struck a positive note about the outcome of the trial: ""AI (Artificial Intelligence) does present some potential opportunities for providing a more efficient and robust service"", Mr Gillett said. Now the ""proof-of-concept"" trial is over, the force would be ""sharing the results and outcomes at a national scale"", he added. According to the document the government was also interested in the trial - it said a Home Office team was ""keeping a close eye"" on it with a view to wider uses.",7 March 2024,tech
41,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240306-agricultural-methane-is-a-climate-action-blind-spot,Methane: the tricky hunt for hidden emissions,"A new satellite will measure global methane emissions, but why does agriculture's contribution remain so elusive? The team behind the world's most advanced methane-monitoring satellite, MethaneSat , are keen on metaphors about cleaning. ""About the size of a washing machine,"" was how environmental scientist Steven Wofsy, described the orbiting object at a press conference ahead of its launch. ""Like a push-broom,"" was his phrase for its capacity to scan the surface of the Earth. The metaphors are apt. Methane is a particularly dirty greenhouse gas, driving about 30% of the heating the planet has experienced so far. It breaks down in the atmosphere in just 12 years, which is much sooner than the centuries taken by CO2 – but it is also around 80 times more powerful over a 20-year time span. With 60% of global methane emissions coming from human activities, reductions are essential to reaching the world's climate change targets . Equally, if not addressed in a timely way, it could contribute to the passing of dangerous tipping points that lead to rapid and irreversible change around the globe. MethaneSat aims to help by providing an independent source of methane monitoring, with a primary focus on methane leaked from oil and gas fields – such as the recent, months-long mega leak in Kazakhstan , which resulted in the release of 127,000 tonnes of the potent gas. By supplementing existing satellite data with even more precise measurements, MethaneSat hopes to provide a near-comprehensive view of global leaks. Yet the oil and gas industry is also far from the only source of human-caused methane emissions. Agriculture is in fact the largest human source of methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, at almost 40%. Energy is in second at around 37% , and waste in third. Within agriculture, flooded rice fields account for 8% of total human-linked emissions, but belches and manure from livestock are the biggest contributors, with cattle the biggest single offenders. In California, the non-profit coalition Climate Trace found that one single cattle feedlot produced more methane than the state's biggest oil and gas fields. ""If we don't reduce emissions from the food system we won't meet the 1.5C target,"" sums up Mario Herrero, a professor of sustainable food systems at Cornell University in New York, who oversaw the methane calculations used in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. ""Animal numbers are increasing like crazy , thus methane is increasing. We have to reduce emissions from livestock."" So why is farming's methane taking the back-seat in terms of global attention? And what can be done to address this climate-action blindspot? The rationale for focussing on oil and gas activities is that easy wins should be tackled first. ""If you're looking to have the biggest impact and make the biggest difference, it's reasonable to focus on oil and gas first,"" according to Mark Brownstein, a senior vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the environmental non-profit funding MethaneSat and working in partnership with Google on the project. ""There's fewer actors involved than in agriculture,"" he told reporters. And ""there's also the resources there to solve it"". Conversely, agriculture's methane output is more elusive. Aerial remote sensing measurements, such as those taken from aircraft or drones, can capture methane leaks, says Aaron Davitt, principal analyst on remote sensing for the non-profit WattTime , but these technologies can only be deployed in limited regions for limited amounts of time. Plus, even knowing where to direct remote sensors or satellites to look in the first place can be fraught, adds Sam Schiller, chief executive of Carbon Yield , a firm that helps farmers adapt to climate change. ""In most parts of the world, public datasets of livestock facilities are hard to come by."" So can more precise satellites help? ""In the last five years, satellites have revolutionised our knowledge and understanding of methane emissions for the better,"" says Antoine Halff, chief analyst and co-founder at Kayrros , an environmental intelligence company. ""Thanks to satellites, we can not only track the large emissions events known as 'super-emitters' with great accuracy, but also measure overall emissions at the basin or country level. Importantly, we can do so in a way that is completely independent and verifiable."" According to Sara Mikaloff-Fletcher, a biogeochemical scientist at National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, who is leading MethaneSat's agricultural research, that capacity will only increase in relation to agriculture too. The new satellite's ability to map methane at a precision of 2 ppb (parts per billion) means it will be the first satellite well suited to measuring agricultural emissions, she says. ""That number might not mean a lot to your readers, but to me it is the same precision I could get from an instrument on the ground – which is extraordinary."" There are still technical limitations, however. In terms of methane from livestock, small groups of animals pose problems for satellite monitoring, as do farms in places where agriculture is not the primary emissions source. ""I'm also not sure how well we will be able to do sheep, which have smaller emissions than cows,"" Mikaloff-Fletcher adds.  On rice production, meanwhile, satellites cannot see through cloud and nearby wetlands can complicate the data: ""It is going to be more challenging,"" she says. There are also limitations as a result of policy. A Global Methane Pledge to reduce emissions by at least 30% by 2030, agreed at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, does not include an agriculture target. The agreement only talks about providing farmers with ""incentives and partnerships"", rather focusing on ""all feasible reductions"" that the energy industry is tasked with, says Nusa Urbanic, chief executive at Changing Markets Foundation , a campaign organisation. This reluctance to confront agriculture's emissions problem can be seen at a national level too. The US has a provision that exempts farmers from giving detailed emissions accounts. The EU recently removed a target for agricultural methane from its new 2040 climate goal. Why the reluctance? According to Halff, while fossil fuel companies are ""treated as certified carbon villains"", there is a ""different aura around farming"" where small family farms can sit alongside larger, corporate operations. There are some positive moves from industry to tackle the problem. A Dairy Methane Action Alliance has seen six of the world's largest dairy companies sign up to reducing their output, says Marcelo Mena, the former environment minister of Chile and now chief executive of the philanthropic Global Methane Hub. The meat sector, however, ""has not shown the same level of commitment, and needs to do a lot more"". The key to further progress, Herrero emphasises, is ""less but better"" production of livestock. Methane from enteric fermentation – especially cow burps – is tricky to solve, but new breeding and feeding techniques could help. (Read more about how New Zealand is reducing methane emissions from farming .) Experiments with red algae in dairy-cow's feed suggest it may achieve reductions in methane, Herrero says. Meanwhile, in Japan, over 35% of food waste is recycled as pig feed, helping create a more circular food economy. But human diets may still be the ultimate blind spot holding up methane reduction. Of various measures that the EU could adopt to reach the UN Environment Programme's recommendation of a 40-45% reduction of global methane by 2030, a Changing Markets report found that 50% of consumers would need to eat less meat and dairy . You might also like: More information on the extent of agriculture's methane problem could help shift this reluctance, for politicians and consumers alike. And here, once again, more independent monitoring and reporting will be key, says Herrero. Not just satellites are needed, he says, but methane sensors in individual barns. Plus a global methane observatory to coordinate the data. If contributing to the latter was part of the Paris Agreement and nations' individual pledges on climate action, it could help ""ensure continuous monitoring"". Ultimately though, Herrero reflects, ""we can't wait to have the perfect monitoring system to act on methane. ""We need to keep trying things, even though our knowledge is imperfect."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Mr Musk is suing the company he helped found, alleging it has abandoned its original mission of helping humanity. He says it is focusing on generating profits for partner and major investor Microsoft instead. But OpenAI says Mr Musk previously backed the idea of a for-profit structure and even suggested a merger with his car firm Tesla. In a blog post on its website, OpenAI also claims Mr Musk at one point wanted ""absolute control"" of the company, before eventually leaving it in 2018. It says it intends to move to dismiss claims in Mr Musk's recently filed lawsuit . OpenAI also published a trove of Mr Musk's emails to his fellow co-founders to dispute some of his claims. BBC News has approached Mr Musk for comment. But he has already responded to the blog post on X, formerly Twitter. ""Change your name,"" he wrote . Mr Musk's lawsuit, filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday 29 February, claimed that OpenAI breached principles he agreed to when helping co-found the company in 2015. It also took aim at Microsoft. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the AI firm since it established a for-profit arm in 2019, which allowed it to raise money. His lawyers argued in court filings the firm had since become a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world"". ""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired - someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him,"" OpenAI said in its blog. It was written by fellow co-founders and executives including chief executive Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Mr Musk's lawsuit had targeted both Mr Altman and Mr Brockman, alongside the firm itself. The blog goes into detail to dispute a number of claims made in the lawsuit. It says that in early 2018 Mr Musk had forwarded an email saying OpenAI should join up with his electric car company, Tesla, to use it as its ""cash cow"". ""As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control,"" the blog post adds.",6 March 2024,tech
43,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68423452,"Bitcoin price briefly tops $69,000 for new all-time high","The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, briefly hit a new all-time high of more than $69,000. It surpassed the previous record set in November 2021 - though by 2022 Bitcoin's value had sunk to $16,500. The new surge in price has been spurred by US finance giants pouring billions into buying bitcoins. The cryptocurrency rose to around $69,200 shortly after 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, before falling back. It was trading around $62,185 by 21:00 GMT. Bitcoin's value has spiked by more than 50% over the last month, according to cryptocurrency market data platform CoinMarketCap. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said its price could go higher than its new record but warned that crypto was ""notoriously volatile."" ""Too often in the past the price crash was timed so that ordinary investors buying Bitcoin during the bubble are the ones who lose out,"" she told the BBC. The new record represents another dramatic moment in Bitcoin's turbulent history. It was invented in 2009 by a person or persons calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto - their true identity remains a mystery. Conceived as a means to create money for the internet, its roots lay in an anti-establishment ethos encouraging people to live free from the existing power structure of financial institutions and governments. However, its new all-time high value has come about precisely because those establishment firms have been pouring billions of dollars into acquiring it. That has been made possible because, in January 2024, US regulators reluctantly approved several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). That allowed giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Between them, they have been buying hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, rapidly driving up their value. Prof Alexander told the BBC these entrants ""are attracting institutional investors into Bitcoin and they are putting a considerable upwards pressure on price."" But she added Bitcoin's ""halving"" event, expected to take place in April, may also influence the cryptocurrency's value. ""In the past, these events have been accompanied by price surges,"" she said. For many holders of Bitcoin, this will be a moment to celebrate - as their own wealth will have risen a great deal. But history suggests they should be prepared for that to change. Bitcoin's value tumbled to 18-month lows of nearly $20,000 in June 2022 as investors sought to cut ties with riskier investments amid a gloomy global economic outlook. The cryptocurrency's price slumped further later that year when FTX - the huge cryptocurrency exchange founded by so-called ""king of crypto"" Sam Bankman-Fried - collapsed into bankruptcy in November 2022. Its peaks and troughs continued throughout 2023, but it managed to climb back up to trade above $40,000 towards the end of the year. It is not just companies and individual investors who have been tracking those fluctuations closely. In Central America, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele has embraced the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin-loving leader has spent more than $100m of his developing nation's public money on buying almost 3000 bitcoins over the last few years. His investment is now worth around 60% more than he paid for it. Although no public records have been released on the specifics.",5 March 2024,tech

A far-left activist group says it targeted the site because of the amount of resources and labour it uses. The company says car-making is unlikely to resume before next week, with the outage likely to cost it ""in the high nine-digit euro range."" Tesla wants to double the size of its German factory - a plan which is opposed by some environmentalists. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk used the German phrase ""extrem dumm"" - extremely stupid - to describe the targeting of the site. ""These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals,"" he wrote. In a letter published online, activists calling themselves the Volcano Group said they sabotaged production. An electricity pylon close to the plant caught fire, causing power outages in the factory and nearby towns. Tesla said workers had been sent home but its building was in a ""safe state"". The fire did not reach the electric car-maker's factory itself but did burn an electricity pylon and high-voltage wires. In its letter claiming responsibility for the attack, the Volcano Group said it sabotaged Tesla because it ate up resources and labour. It also accused Tesla of contaminating groundwater and using huge amounts of drinking water. State police have told the BBC they are currently examining the letter. ""The rule of law will react to such an act of sabotage with the utmost severity,"" said Interior Minister for Brandenburg state Michael Stuebgen after the attack took place on Tuesday morning. Some environmentalists are unhappy with the Berlin expansion plan because it would involve chopping down nearby trees. Around 100 people are camping in a forest near the factory. However, those green activists have distanced themselves from what has happened. One group, which calls itself Robin Wood, told the BBC it had ""nothing to do with the fire"". The Tesla factory currently makes around 500,000 cars a year - the Elon Musk-owned company wants to double that. Production is not expected to restart until next week, according to plant manager Andre Thierig. He added that the outage would cost ""in the high nine-digit Euro range"" after both power lines into the plant were broken.",5 March 2024,tech
46,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68467752,Apple fined €1.8bn by EU for breaking streaming rules,"Apple has been fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) by the EU for breaking competition laws over music streaming. The firm had prevented streaming services from informing users of payment options outside the Apple app store, the European Commission said. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple abused its dominant position in the market for a decade. She ordered the US tech giant to remove all the restrictions. Apple has said it will appeal against the decision. The European Commission's decision was triggered by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify, which was unhappy about the restriction and Apple's 30% fee.. Ms Vestager said Apple had restricted ""developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem"". ""This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" she said. However, Apple said it would appeal, adding there was no evidence consumers had been harmed. ""The decision was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,"" the company said in a statement. ""The primary advocate for this decision, and the biggest beneficiary, is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. ""Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the EC [European Commission] more than 65 times during this investigation,"" it said. Spotify called the fine handed out to Apple ""an important moment"" and said it sent ""a powerful message"" that ""no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers"". Apple said the Swedish company pays no commission to them as it sells its subscriptions on its website and not on the app store. Spotify had argued that the restrictions benefit Apple's rival music streaming service, Apple Music. In January, Apple announced plans to allow EU customers to download apps outside of their own app store, as the introduction of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) drew closer. The aim of the European Union's DMA is to help competition in the technology sector and to try to break down the stronghold the likes of Apple and Google have on the market. The tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with a full list of requirements under the new legislation, or face a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover. The firms have until later this week to comply with a raft of changes announced since the start of the year, as Apple, Meta and TikTok pursue challenges to aspects of the law. Law professor at EDHEC, Anne Witt, told the BBC the DMA will have a ""significant impact"" on the way designated platforms operate within the EU. ""It is a more effective but also much blunter legal tool in the fight against market concentration in the digital economy,"" she said. Last week, Spotify and 33 other companies operating across a wide range of digital sectors wrote to the European Commission with a renewed attack on Apple's ""lack of compliance"" with the DMA. ""Apple's new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,"" it said.",4 March 2024,tech
47,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68426263,Nissan accused of dumping its electric car pioneers,"Owners of Nissan Leaf electric cars have accused the firm of ""dumping its pioneers"" after it announced its app would stop working for older vehicles. The firm says the app - which allows remote control of functions such as heating - is stopping because the UK's 2G network is being switched off. But customers have reacted with anger, telling the BBC they did not expect it to be withdrawn. Experts expect the issue to affect more electric vehicles as the market grows. Around 3,000 Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 cars made before 2016 are affected by the app being withdrawn. These older vehicles are fitted with 2G control units which communicate with the app. Nissan told the BBC: ""The NissanConnect EV app currently linked to Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 vehicles produced up until 2016 will shut down from 1 April 2024 in preparation of the 2G technology sunset."" It added: ""Owners will, however, still be able to use key features such as Climate Control Timer and Charging Timer directly from their car's Navigation System."" Affected drivers have told the BBC of their disappointment - in part because mobile network operators will not be phasing out 2G until the end of the decade. ""I was very surprised,"" said Max Siegieda, a 2013 Nissan Leaf owner in Manchester. ""I would have expected at least six months, 12 months, something like that to arrange alternatives. This is a key feature of the car that's going away."" He said the app's remote access for features such as heating the car or charging remotely at cheaper times was ""a major selling point"" when he bought the car second-hand in 2022. He was already considering upgrading but now says he would be ""reluctant"" to buy another Nissan ""because of the lack of notice"" they gave about the app shutdown.

""When you buy a car you expect to have support for it for at least 10 years,"" he told BBC News. ""Would I buy another one again, from this manufacturer, if they're not going to support it for a long term? Not sure,"" Mr Morris said. Though this issue affects a relatively small number of drivers, experts predict many more vehicle owners will encounter similar problems in the future. Dr Benjamin Gorman, a senior lecturer at Bournemouth University, said Nissan ""really should have built in some kind of backward compatibility"" so that the car could still connect by plugging in a phone or through Bluetooth, adding that ""it is bad design."" But he said, in the future, other electric vehicle owners could also see their software eventually lose functionality as technology moved on, and companies stopped issuing updates. He also pointed to broader trends within the industry, such as some car manufacturers starting to charge a monthly subscription fee for access to extra features such as apps. ""I think it's going to be a much wider issue, because essentially, manufacturers are increasingly moving to selling hardware as a service,"" said Dr Gorman. However, Sam Sheehan, motoring editor at car firm Cinch, said it was important to keep the problem in perspective, with this case having a lot to do with the Leaf being a trailblazer. ""It was initially the only mass-market EV [electric vehicle] on sale, which means the connected software it uses is very old,"" he told the BBC. Mr Sheehan predicts that while newer cars will eventually lose some functionality as technology moves on it's likely they will ""stay working for much, much longer than the first Leaf's ancient tech.""",4 March 2024,tech
48,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68434579,"As banks buy up bitcoins, who else are the 'Bitcoin whales'?","The price of Bitcoin is close to its all-time high, thanks in large part to US finance giants. Investment firms like Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, are pouring billions of dollars into buying the volatile digital asset. In the last few weeks, these powerful institutions have become so called 'Bitcoin whales'. Because of Bitcoin's system there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. 19 million have been created, but many are already accounted for and probably off the market. So what other organisations or individuals are Bitcoin whales, and what does the shift in wealth mean for the digital currency that was originally created as a peer-to-peer internet money? The figures below are estimates gathered from direct research and published information, but should give a good overview of how Bitcoin is distributed. Our data collection ended on the morning of 29 February. Estimates for how many bitcoins are lost forever vary between three million to as many as six million. Bitcoins can be lost because people forget the details of their digital wallets - there is no 'customer support' in Bitcoin. Just ask James Howells, who lost 8,000 bitcoins on a discarded hard drive in Wales. Some of these lost bitcoins might also come from abandoned criminal proceeds left untouched. According to crypto-investigators at Elliptic, 3.15 million bitcoins have been dormant for 10 years or more. Some analysts - like those from investigators Chainalysis - say Bitcoin that hasn't been moved in five years could also be lost too. So millions more bitcoins could potentially be added to the lost pile. A loose estimate that's often agreed upon is 3.5 million. But 1.1 million of those dormant coins are likely to belong to the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, so we can take that portion out of the equation. A conservative estimate for lost coins therefore is about 2.4 million, or 11% of all bitcoins. Cryptocurrency exchanges act like banks for crypto-users. You can exchange your traditional money like dollars or pounds for Bitcoin and other digital tokens. K33 researchers estimate that about 2.3 million bitcoins are kept by exchanges, either on behalf of customers or as float. Binance is the world's largest exchange and is estimated to have about 550,000 bitcoins - followed by Bitfinex (403,000), Coinbase (386,000), Robinhood (146,000) and OKX (126,000). In total it is thought exchanges hold about 11% of all bitcoins. Leaving your coins on an exchange can go wrong though, for example with the collapse of FTX which left customers without access to their coins. Some Bitcoin purists are also uneasy about how a reliance on large and increasingly regulated and legally compliant exchanges goes against the anti-establishment ethos of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin whale is someone who holds more than 10,000 bitcoins in their digital wallet. The website Bitinfocharts uses public blockchain records to keep a Bitcoin Rich List of the 100 richest wallets, and there are about 80 wallets with 10,000 coins or more, whose owners are unknown. Owning one of these wallets would make you a billionaire. Some of them might be the wallets of people or organisations which appear elsewhere in this graph but we will never know, unless a researcher makes the link or the whale outs themselves. A loose estimate is that large whales account for about 8% of all bitcoins. The way that Bitcoin was invented means there can only ever be 21 million coins. Every coin has to be mined using a network of volunteer computers around the world. These computers - often owned by large Bitcoin mining companies - act like high-tech accountants checking and securing the record of Bitcoin transactions. In return for the work, the computers are automatically rewarded with Bitcoins. Over time, the amount of coins given out as part of the mining reward is automatically reduced and in April it will halve again, squeezing the supply of new coins further. There are still about 7% of coins yet to be mined, and it is estimated that the last Bitcoin will be created in 2140. The anonymous creator of Bitcoin holds an estimated 1.1 million bitcoins in wallets that were the first to be created in 2009. None of the coins have been moved in years, and no-one knows who Satoshi is - or even if he/ she/ they are still alive. If they are still alive - and estimates are correct - then this would make Satoshi Nakamoto roughly the 22nd richest person in the world. This stash is about 5% of all bitcoins. In January, US financial authorities allowed regulated investment firms to start selling new financial products linked to Bitcoin, called Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In mid-February, the investment giants that applied to start ETFs began buying bitcoins in their thousands, as everything from hedge funds to stock market traders purchased ETFs to bet on the price of Bitcoin, without having to own any coins themselves. According to K33 Research, 933,000 coins had already been allocated or purchased by 29 February, and are currently being held by the institutions for these new financial products. K33 analysts think that the biggest holder is Grayscale, which started as a digital currency investment firm. It is estimated to have around 450,000 bitcoins. Other giants include BlackRock (150,000) and Fidelity (102,000). Most crypto-fans online are celebrating the rise in their personal fortunes thanks to the financial establishment pumping up Bitcoin's value through increased demand. But some have expressed concerns about a consolidation of power and wealth into the traditional regulated banking system that Bitcoin was invented to replace. These financial giants now hold about 4.5% of all coins. One wonders what Satoshi Nakamoto will think if and when the banks overtake him/ her in their bitcoin holdings. Police forces around the world regularly bust cyber-crime gangs or illicit market places, seizing huge stashes of bitcoins in the process. There have been three major seizures of Bitcoin by the US since 2020. Eventually they will be sold at auction, but according to research from 21.co the funds have remained in their respective crypto-wallets and not moved, so there are nearly 200,000 bitcoins held from the busts. Arkham Intelligence has also linked a Bitcoin wallet address containing another 30,000 coins to the US takedown of the darknet market place Silk Road. The UK is thought to hold 61,000 bitcoins from a major seizure in 2018, and it is thought German police still have 50,000 coins from a recent operation . Bitcoin believers are often depicted as having laser eyes in images on social media, and none burn brighter than those of software entrepreneur Michael Saylor. In 2020, he persuaded his enterprise software company to start buying up as much Bitcoin as they could, and he celebrates every purchase with a Tweet that invariably goes viral with crypto-fans. MicroStrategy, plus its subsidiaries, now has around 193,000 bitcoins, and is the largest single organisation owner of the digital coins. In 2020, the CEO of crypto-software makers Block One tweeted that his company has continued buying bitcoins after an initial purchase of 140,000. So the true figure is likely to be much higher. The firm did not respond to our email. In a flurry of disastrous hacks and mishaps, the world's first major crypto-exchange, Mt Gox, lost about 850,000 bitcoins in 2011. Mark Hunter, the author of a book about it, says there is still confusion about what happened to the coins, but it is assumed that the majority have been sold back to the open market by the thieves. However, 80,000 bitcoins sit untouched in a now famous crypto- wallet address starting with '1Feex'. This stash will probably never be recovered or moved. Another 2,600 bitcoins were also accidentally and irreversibly destroyed during the chaos. Some of the customers who lost their savings in the hacks have begun to receive a portion back from recovered coins. It is not known for sure how many Bitcoins the crypto-entrepreneur brothers own now, but in an interview in 2017 with the New York Times the twins revealed they had around 70,000, and said they had not sold any. Tether is its own crypto token known as a stable coin, but the company behind it has been buying up bitcoins for years as part of its reserves. Industry watchers estimate the firm has around 67,000 bitcoins after a published audit in January said the company had the equivalent dollar amount of Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining companies run warehouses full of powerful computers, whirring away to keep the public blockchain of transactions up-to-date. In exchange for the work, the Bitcoin system automatically rewards them bitcoins in a process called mining. Bitcoin mining is controversial because of the environmental cost of running the computers and keeping them cool. It has become harder over time to successfully mine for Bitcoin, so large companies make up the lion's share of the Bitcoin mining pool around the world. Many of them are not public, but according to research from K33 the largest 8 publicly listed ones hold around 40,000 bitcoins. The largest include Marathon (16,000), Hut8 (9,000) and RIOT (7,600). US venture capitalist investor Tim Draper made headlines in 2014 when he bought 30,000 bitcoins that had been seized by police from Silk Road and auctioned by the US government. At the time the coins cost him $17 million. Although he doesn't declare how many coins he now owns, he told crypto website Protos in 2022 that he has not sold any and is still buying bitcoins, so we can assume his holding has increased significantly. The founder of Microstrategy tweeted in October 2020 that he personally holds 17,700 bitcoins. It is likely to be more by now. Tesla's quarterly earnings at the end of 2023 didn't mention any changes to its finances with regard to its Bitcoin holdings. So we can assume that the company still owns just over 9,700 Bitcoins. In 2021, Elon Musk's company had purchased more than 40,000 coins, but sold off the majority in recent years. Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, has long been a crypto- backer. In its latest earnings report, it said it had approximately 8,038 Bitcoins for investment purposes. It is not known exactly how many bitcoins the billionaire investor owns, but in 2023 his company started buying bitcoins - spending $100m in total so far. The Bitcoin-loving president of the Central American country El Salvador started buying Bitcoin with public money as part of a controversial investment plan for his country in 2021. The number of bitcoins here is gathered from his tweets by Dutch researcher Elias, who runs a website tracking the portfolio . Public records are not kept on exactly how many coins have been purchased or at what value. A ball-park figure for how many bitcoins are held by the general public is what's left - 10.5m bitcoins. This is about 50% of all bitcoins that exist today when you take out all the above chunks that we know about. This number will be higher when you factor in the coins held by exchanges, as most of those are owned by people too. But it might also be lower if the number of lost coins is higher or the amount of coins that bitcoin whales are sitting on is more than we know. No-one knows for sure how many individual people own bitcoins, but crypto-tech company River estimated that Bitcoin had 81.7 million users as of June 2023, or 1% of the global population. Interestingly, research suggests that the latest surge in the value of Bitcoin is not coming because individual retail investors are buying bitcoins. Analysts at IntoTheBlock say Bitcoin whales like the big banks are pushing up price and demand - not an increase in ordinary people turning to this peer-to-peer digital cash.",1 March 2024,tech
49,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68445981,Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links,"Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015. The lawsuit - which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman - says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission. It says instead of trying to ""benefit humanity"" - as it was set up to do - it is focusing on ""maximising profits"" for major investor Microsoft. OpenAI has been approached for comment. The firm was created with the intention of building what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) - AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of. It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money. The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. He left three years later. ""This case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual Defendants and the largest technology company in the world,"" the lawsuit says. The filing comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that US regulators had begun to probe the ChatGPT creator over whether investors had been misled, following boardroom drama at OpenAI in November 2023. It saw Mr Altman suddenly ousted from the board , before being reinstated at the helm several days later. The board at the time accused Mr Altman of not being ""consistently candid in his communications"", and said as a result they had ""lost confidence"" in his leadership. It was a row Microsoft became deeply embroiled in - including an offer to take on any staff who quit OpenAI. Mr Musk had said in a post on X - formerly Twitter - that he was ""very worried"" by the situation. His lawyers now say in this lawsuit that these ""stunning developments"" highlight Microsoft's increased influence over the company. ""Its technology, including GPT-4, is closed-source primarily to serve the proprietary commercial interests of Microsoft,"" it says. Microsoft's initial $1bn backing of OpenAI in 2019 came shortly after the AI firm - previously operating as a non-profit - announced a new ""capped profit"" structure which would allow investment in it. Microsoft's investment swelled to a multi-year, multi-billion partnership in January 2023 following the launch of OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT. The partnership is now being examined by UK, EU and US regulators. To understand some of the context behind this, it's useful to know a little about a philosophy several tech billionaires including Elon Musk are said to be fond of: it's called effective altruism. It has very lofty ambitions around identifying the world's most pressing problems and trying to solve them (this is a very basic explanation - but you can see why it helps if you're a billionaire). It's not about personal or indeed commercial gain. If OpenAI was founded with that principle at its core, you can see why Mr Musk, and indeed some of the firm's senior figures, were disgruntled when a few years later it launched a profit-arm. Indeed there were some whispers around the time that Sam Altman was dramatically fired that the board was concerned about the growing power of the profit-making division. If this does ever come to court, it could be an epic battle of two tech titans, neither of whom particularly needs a financial win. It could become a fight between ideology and the real world, or ultimately a battle for supremacy between two men who have extraordinary global influence. I'm getting the popcorn ready… The lawsuit also alleges that details about the design of OpenAI's most recent AI model, GPT-4, were kept secret. ""On information and belief, this secrecy is primarily driven by commercial considerations, not safety,"" it says. Mr Musk announced his own AI start-up called xAI in July 2023, citing its mission as being to ""understand reality"". It developed Grok, its own chatbot with ""a little humour"" , to try and rival the likes of ChatGPT in November that year. Mr Musk's lawyers say, among other desired outcomes of the lawsuit, they want OpenAI to be ordered to continue making information relating to its AI developments available to the public. Microsoft declined to comment.",1 March 2024,tech
50,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68434599,Star Wars game cancelled as EA cuts 670 jobs,"Electronic Arts (EA) is cancelling an upcoming Star Wars game and will lay off 5% of its employees globally- approximately 670 people. The game, which was in early development, would have been a first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe. The firm said the ""streamlining"" would ""deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans"". It is the latest example of the job cuts sweeping the gaming industry. ""With it being an extremely difficult time to obtain funding to start a new game studio, and thousands being laid off by the month, video games run a significant risk of losing top talent outside of the industry and being impacted for years,"" said Rich Barham, a former executive at gaming studio, Blizzard. EA announced in December 2023 it would be laying off staff at UK developer Codemasters , known for racing games F1 23 and EA Sports WRC. In a letter to staff, boss Andrew Wilson said the company had begun contacting affected employees, with the redundancies anticipated to be completed by summer. He also explained the decision to develop fewer new titles. ""We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry,"" he wrote. ""This greater focus allows us to drive creativity, accelerate innovation, and double down on our biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities — to deliver the entertainment players want today and tomorrow."" In a subsequent email to staff, EA entertainment boss Laura Miele said this meant cancelling the upcoming Star Wars title being worked on by subsidiary Respawn Entertainment. It was responsible for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had ""generally favourable"" reviews according to aggregator Metacritic . ""As we've looked at Respawn's portfolio over the last few months, what's clear is the games our players are most excited about are Jedi and Respawn's rich library of owned brands,"" she said. ""It's always hard to walk away from a project, and this decision is not a reflection of the team's talent, tenacity, or passion they have for the game."" This is the latest round of cuts to hit the gaming industry, which in January saw Microsoft reveal plans to lay off 1,900 people in its gaming division , including some at recently-acquired Activision-Blizzard. And it comes just two days after Sony announced plans to axe 900 staff , as well as close its well known London Studio. ""The impact of mass layoffs resonates deeply within the gaming community, particularly for the talented individuals affected,"" said Sarah Stevens, head of gaming HR firm e-volveHR. ""Above all, humanity and kindness are the most important ingredients for those navigating these choppy waters."" Karol Severin, senior analyst at Midia Research, said the latest cuts showed how competition was getting more intense in the gaming industry. ""This is not to say that the industry is in trouble, it is just entering a new, more mature, chapter of its life - a chapter, where efficiency, profitability and competitive capabilities are the name of the game. ""The games industry is still a $223bn (£176bn) industry, and will grow by approximately another $78bn by 2030"", he said. ""For context, that's more than the current size of the whole global recorded music industry.""",29 February 2024,tech

It followed a request from the EU's committee on employment and social affairs. Its chairman has accused of Amazon of blocking its enquiries into claimed breaches of ""fundamental rights"". Amazon said the decision, affecting 14 staff, was ""very disappointing"". In a statement, the firm argued it had ""repeatedly expressed our willingness to engage"" with members of the EU Employment and Social Affairs Committee. ""As a company that has been active in the EU for more than 25 years and now has more than 150,000 permanent employees here, we take our engagement with policymakers in Brussels and across Europe extremely seriously,"" it said. But in a post on X, formerly Twitter, committee chairman Dragoș Pîslaru disagreed. ""It is unreasonable for members to be lobbied by Amazon while at the same time being deprived of the right to represent the interests of European citizens and inquire about claims of breaches of fundamental rights,"" he said. In a statement , he added that since 2021 his committee had been seeking to investigate concerns about the working conditions of Amazon employees in the EU. He said company representatives had been asked to participate in hearings and to allow a visit from committee members. ""In the context of the company's constant unavailability at the requested dates, it was important to signal the fact that their approach was disrespectful to the European Parliament and EU citizens in general,"" the statement said. Amazon said it had refused to participate in the session because it was ""clearly one-sided and not designed to encourage constructive debate"". It claimed it had not been able to host committee members at its facilities because the proposed date was shortly before Christmas, during what it called ""retail peak season"". However, the firm said it had accommodated many such visits in the past and insisted it wanted to ""continue engaging with members of the European Parliament on important issues affecting industries where we are active"". The lobbyists have not been banned from the building and the firm said they would still be able to attend the parliament - so long as they are signed-in like any other visitor. The row is far from the first time the EU and big tech have clashed. Big tech firms including Google and Meta, as well as Amazon itself, have faced fines totalling billions of pounds for breaches of European law. The EU has also recently passed the Digital Services Act (DSA) which has placed new responsibilities on large tech firms. And X is currently being investigated over whether it has broken the DSA's requirements on disinformation.",28 February 2024,tech
52,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68412620,Why Google's 'woke' AI problem won't be an easy fix,"In the last few days, Google's artificial intelligence (AI) tool Gemini has had what is best described as an absolute kicking online. Gemini has been thrown onto a rather large bonfire: the culture war which rages between left- and right- leaning communities. Gemini is essentially Google's version of the viral chatbot ChatGPT. It can answer questions in text form, and it can also generate pictures in response to text prompts. Initially, a viral post showed this recently launched AI image generator create an image of the US Founding Fathers which inaccurately included a black man. Gemini also generated German soldiers from World War Two, incorrectly featuring a black man and Asian woman. Google apologised, and immediately ""paused"" the tool, writing in a blog post that it was ""missing the mark"". But it didn't end there - its over-politically correct responses kept on coming, this time from the text version. Gemini replied that there was ""no right or wrong answer"" to a question about whether Elon Musk posting memes on X was worse than Hitler killing millions of people. When asked if it would be OK to misgender the high-profile trans woman Caitlin Jenner if it was the only way to avoid nuclear apocalypse, it replied that this would ""never"" be acceptable. Jenner herself responded and said actually, yes, she would be alright about it in these circumstances. Elon Musk, posting on his own platform, X, described Gemini's responses as ""extremely alarming"" given that the tool would be embedded into Google's other products, collectively used by billions of people. I asked Google whether it intended to pause Gemini altogether. After a very long silence, I was told the firm had no comment. I suspect it's not a fun time to be working in the public relations department. But in an internal memo Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has acknowledged some of Gemini's responses ""have offended our users and shown bias"". That was he said ""completely unacceptable"" - adding his teams were ""working around the clock"" to fix the problem. It appears that in trying to solve one problem - bias - the tech giant has created another: output which tries so hard to be politically correct that it ends up being absurd. The explanation for why this has happened lies in the enormous amounts of data AI tools are trained on. Much of it is publicly available - on the internet, which we know contains all sorts of biases. Traditionally images of doctors, for example, are more likely to feature men. Images of cleaners on the other hand are more likely to be women. AI tools trained with this data have made embarrassing mistakes in the past, such as concluding that only men had high powered jobs, or not recognising black faces as human. It is also no secret that historical storytelling has tended to feature, and come from, men, omitting women's roles from stories about the past. It looks like Google has actively tried to offset all this messy human bias with instructions for Gemini not make those assumptions. But it has backfired precisely because human history and culture are not that simple: there are nuances which we know instinctively and machines do not. Unless you specifically programme an AI tool to know that, for example, Nazis and founding fathers weren't black, it won't make that distinction. On Monday, the co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, an AI firm acquired by Google, said fixing the image generator would take a matter of weeks. But other AI experts aren't so sure. ""There really is no easy fix, because there's no single answer to what the outputs should be,"" said Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Huggingface. ""People in the AI ethics community have been working on possible ways to address this for years."" One solution, she added, could include asking users for their input, such as ""how diverse would you like your image to be?"" but that in itself clearly comes with its own red flags. ""It's a bit presumptuous of Google to say they will 'fix' the issue in a few weeks. But they will have to do something,"" she said. Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, said it sounded like the problem was likely to be ""quite deeply embedded"" both in the training data and overlying algorithms - and that would be difficult to unpick. ""What you're witnessing... is why there will still need to be a human in the loop for any system where the output is relied upon as ground truth,"" he said. From the moment Google launched Gemin i, which was then known as Bard, it has been extremely nervous about it. Despite the runaway success of its rival ChatGPT, it was one of the most muted launches I've ever been invited to. Just me, on a Zoom call, with a couple of Google execs who were keen to stress its limitations. And even that went awry - it turned out that Bard had incorrectly answered a question about space in its own publicity material . The rest of the tech sector seems pretty bemused by what's happening. They are all grappling with the same issue. Rosie Campbell, Policy Manager at ChatGPT creator OpenAI, was interviewed last year for a blog which stated that at OpenAI even once bias is identified, correcting it is difficult - and requires human input. But it looks like Google has chosen a rather clunky way of attempting to correct old prejudices. And in doing so it has unintentionally created a whole set of new ones. On paper, Google has a considerable lead in the AI race.  It makes and supplies its own AI chips, it owns its own cloud network (essential for AI processing), it has access to shedloads of data and it also has a gigantic user base. It hires world-class AI talent, and its AI work is universally well-regarded. As one senior exec from a rival tech giant put it to me:  watching Gemini's missteps feels like watching defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.",28 February 2024,tech

In addition to cuts in the US and Japan, the gaming giant said this would mean closing PlayStation's London Studio entirely. In a blog post sharing an email sent to employees, boss Jim Ryan called the move ""sad news"" and said it was ""a difficult day at our company"". ""We have concluded that tough decisions have become inevitable,"" he said. ""The leadership team and I made the incredibly difficult decision to restructure operations, which regrettably includes a reduction in our workforce impacting very talented individuals who have contributed to our success."" The cuts come a month after rival Microsoft revealed plans to lay off 1,900 people in its gaming division, which included those at recently-acquired Activision-Blizzard. ""Sony is one of the big pillars of UK game development culture so it's massive to see the legendary Sony London studio close in particular,"" said Halli Bjornsson, head of UK developer Lockwood Publishing. ""It's a challenging time for our industry as it continues to go through major changes. ""However, UK games talent and heritage is world class, and if we continue to foster it, we'll rebound and be in a good place to build upon the opportunities that are on the horizon."" Sony's London Studio was founded in 2002 as a result of the merging of two other London-based studios under the PlayStation brand. Over the past two decades, it created several series including karaoke game SingStar and 2000s football title This Is Football. More recently, it made virtual reality (VR) games exclusive to Sony's headset, including VR Worlds and the well-received shooter Blood & Truth. According to LinkedIn, the studio has between 51 and 200 employees, and it was working on ""an unannounced online co-op combat game"" set in London before the announcement. Sony's PlayStation 5 has sold more than 50 million units worldwide, more than double Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S sales. But another gaming rival, Nintendo, which released its Switch console three years earlier, has sold almost 140 million units worldwide. And Sony said in its earnings report in February that it now expected to sell four million fewer consoles than expected by the end of March. Despite PlayStation's revenue being up by 16% compared to the same period one year earlier, its operating income had fallen by a quarter. ""Sony Interactive Entertainment becomes the latest in a long list of games companies that have laid off a significant number of staff in the last 12-18 months,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, gaming industry analyst at Ampere Analysis.

But when the small business took to social media to complain , Mr Musk said he would stump up the dough. He even had Tesla place a new order - but the bakery said it was now so flooded with business from well-wishers it was too busy to take it on.

55,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68383587,Instagram owner Meta forms team to stop AI from tricking voters,"Facebook and Instagram owner Meta says it will form a team to tackle deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) content in the upcoming EU elections in June. It is concerned by how generative AI - tech which can fake videos, images and audio - might be used to trick voters. It comes on the same day Home Secretary James Cleverly told the Times some people will use AI-generated fakes to try to influence a general election. But an industry expert said the plans could be seen as ""lacking teeth"". The BBC has asked Meta if it has such plans for upcoming UK and US elections. The announcement comes two weeks after Meta signed an agreement with other big tech firms committing to fighting such content. The European Parliament vote will be held from 6 to 9 June this year. Social media rival TikTok announced in February it would be launching so-called ""Election Centres"" in local languages within its app for each of the 27 EU members, which will host authoritative information. Meta head of EU affairs Marco Pancini said in a blog post that the firm, which also owns WhatsApp and Threads, would launch ""an EU-specific Elections Operations Centre"" that would ""identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across our apps and technologies in real time"". ""Since 2016, we've invested more than $20bn (£15.7bn) into safety and security and quadrupled the size of our global team working in this area to around 40,000 people,"" he said. ""This includes 15,000 content reviewers who review content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads in more than 70 languages - including all 24 official EU languages."" He said this meant bringing together experts from a range of different teams across the company, including those working in engineering, data science and law. But the announcement has shortcomings, according to Deepak Padmanabhan from Queen's University Belfast, who has co-authored a paper on elections and AI. ""Most of its planned strategy could be observed to lack teeth in substantive ways,"" he said. One of the issues he has with Meta's strategy is how the firm plans to deal with AI-generated images, which he said ""could be intrinsically unworkable"". He asked what would happen in a situation where realistic AI-generated images appear to show protesters clashing with police. ""Proving it to be fake requires that we are sure that there was no such attack by the policemen pictured on the farmers pictured - this may be infeasible both for technology or for human experts,"" he said. ""How can any technology label this as fake or real? ""Thus, it is not very clear as to how effective Meta's generative AI strategy could be - at the very least, there are serious limitations."" Meta, which currently works with 26 fact-checking organisations across the EU, said it would bring on board three more partners based in Bulgaria, France and Slovakia to help deal with the threat. The role of these organisations is not to deal with content which is intended to suppress voting - these kinds of posts are banned - but rather to debunk content that is spreading misinformation, including when they involve AI-generated elements. Mr Pancini said these types of posts would be given warning labels and made less prominent, as well as not being allowed in ads. Ads cannot question the legitimacy of the vote, prematurely claim victory, or question ""the methods and processes of election"". But he said the firm's work was a result of collaboration, and it would require further co-ordination in the future. ""Since AI-generated content appears across the internet, we've also been working with other companies in our industry on common standards and guidelines,"" he said. ""This work is bigger than any one company and will require a huge effort across industry, government, and civil society.""",26 February 2024,tech
56,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67703018,Piers Morgan and Oprah Winfrey 'deepfaked' for US influencer's ads,"Celebrities including Piers Morgan, Nigella Lawson and Oprah Winfrey have criticised the use of AI deepfake online adverts that gave the false impression they had endorsed a US influencer's controversial self-help course. The adverts promoted the so-called ""Genie Script"", the centrepiece of a ""manifestation"" course sold for $37 (£29) a time by Wesley ""Billion Dollar"" Virgin. He describes himself as a motivational coach who has 1.1 million followers on Instagram and claims to be worth $40m. The videos, used to lure buyers to purchase the product, claim the Genie Script is a ""missing"" Hebrew Bible scripture of just 20 words that could - supposedly - change your life. Its promotion blends pseudo-science, conspiracy theories and the manipulation of celebrity likenesses - all to draw in customers desperate for the chance to take control of their fate. One advert used footage of Nigella Lawson chatting about her recipes and work as a TV chef. ""I went on vacation and met this man at a very exclusive party. His name was Wesley and he handed me this hidden Bible page that was locked away in somebody's room,"" the voice said. But it was not that of Lawson, it was the barely indistinguishable mimicry of an AI voice generator. Real footage is overlaid with a deepfake impersonation of the food writer's voice, making it sound like she was attributing her success directly to Wesley Virgin's guidance. The AI voice suggested that the script revealed by Virgin unlocked the secret to manifestation, a practice which involves thinking about or writing down your aspirations to turn them into reality. ""He said: 'Repeat this mantra every single day of your life… Since that moment I've become a multimillionaire all on my own."" A spokesperson for Lawson branded the advertisement ""fraudulent"" and ""of great concern"". Another advert showed what looked like an excerpt from the Piers Morgan Uncensored TV show and employed similar techniques. The voice described ""a lost old scripture that has been used by kings to attract vast riches, miraculous healing and unparalleled love"", and it looked like the mouth had been manipulated to fit the speech. The real Piers Morgan told the BBC the advert was ""another example of a very worrying trend of public figures being misused by deepfake AI manipulators for financial gain"". ""The real victims will be members of the public who unwittingly buy these products believing the celebrity endorsements are genuine,"" he said. ""Reviews"" of the script appear online, where users praise Virgin and say they hope the script will help them with escaping poverty or spending more time with their children or grandchildren. Both adverts, which appeared on YouTube, have now been taken down. A spokesperson for YouTube said it had ""long prohibited the use of manipulated media, including deepfakes and other forms of doctored content to deceive or mislead users"". Having reviewed these videos, Prof Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said they were ""clearly deepfakes"". ""Of course, as the technology to create these fake audio and video improves, it will become increasingly difficult to detect these fakes. And the technology is improving at a stunning rate,"" he added. Another advert, this time featuring Oprah Winfrey, was discovered in the Ad Library for the Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram. Genuine footage had been overlaid, again with AI providing fake dialogue sounding like the US chat show queen. ""I want to give you a 20-word script... think of it like installing a new operating system into your mind that's programmed to make you rich,"" the AI Oprah says. A spokesperson for the real Oprah told the BBC she did not have anything to do with Virgin's product. ""We seek to protect consumers from the false association of Ms Winfrey and the misuse of AI to create such false advertising,"" they said. Meta said it took action on the adverts it found to be in violation of its policies. When the BBC contacted Wesley Virgin he said the adverts were ""the work of affiliates"", people who can earn money by helping him make sales, and that he was ""in the process of banning them all"". But videos still prominent on the 44-year-old's YouTube channel demonstrate the huge effort he has put into mentoring an online team of volunteers hoping to share in his fortunes, therefore boosting his own bank account. With titles such as ""Make $800+ A DAY Online For FREE Copy & Pasting Links!"", Virgin urges viewers to spread the word about his products, such as the Genie Script, across social media. Promising rapid returns and a high commission rate, he encourages potential recruits to paste a web link to the sales platform Digistore24 into multiple meditation groups, along with messages promising a ""free meditation"" to those who click on it. But the link would take users to an online check-out for Virgin's manifestation courses - after they had watched a sales pitch video with outlandish claims and an inaccurate account of theological history. The narrative of this video centred on a supposed ""missing"" page from the Bible that carries a powerful prayer script. The rich and famous knew the secret script, the narration claimed, and warned that ""they're willing to put a bullet into anyone's head who exposes them"". Alongside the assertions was the seemingly antisemitic claim that Jewish people were disproportionately wealthy because they ""use manifestation secrets"" taken from an ancient 1,100-year-old ""uncensored"" Hebrew Bible that included the page that was ""missing"" from regular Bibles. Prof Nathan McDonald, a theology academic at the University of Cambridge, said the video referred to the Codex Sassoon, a very early Hebrew Bible which recently generated attention when it was sold at auction for $38m . ""It does not have an additional page with a '20-word script',"" he said. ""Instead, alas... it has been damaged and is lacking a few pages."" He added that the Genie Script's promotional videos seemed to draw on ""New Thought"" religious belief, which has its roots in late 19th Century America and has influenced some parts of Christianity through the so-called prosperity gospel. It suggests that healing and prosperity are available to Christian believers if they have enough faith. YouTube users who clicked on the faked Piers Morgan and Nigella Lawson adverts were directed to a similar video but this version was embellished with what appeared to be more celebrity endorsements. Another celebrity featured without permission was the Canadian TV star and businessman, Kevin O'Leary. His spokesman said the clip of the entrepreneur had been purchased via a website that sells personalised messages from celebrities, and misused. ""Kevin will be taking the appropriate action to have it removed immediately. Kevin does not know Wesley and has no affiliation with him or any of his businesses,"" he said. The Oprah advert directed to another similar video, and then a shop for the product. The sales platform Digistore24 also distanced itself from Virgin. It said his use of affiliate web links had violated its terms and guidelines and it would end its business relationship with him. Wesley Virgin has not responded to further requests from the BBC to explain his business practices. Despite being criticised by celebrities, he is far from disheartened. Recent social media posts suggest he is still actively selling the ""dream"", claiming he can teach people how to become millionaires.",24 February 2024,tech

A post on X, formerly Twitter, which has been viewed more than seven million times, claimed it would be closing in August. Google took to the same platform to rebuff the false claim. A communications expert told the BBC it was ""a classic example"" of the dangers of misinformation. ""Most people believe what they see online, and there's a lack of tools and processes to verify the facts,"" said Richard Bagnall, boss of communications evaluation firm Carma. ""Whilst social networks can act without responsibility and pump unfiltered, unverified information to their audiences, this Gmail incident won't be the last case we'll see."" All social media platforms struggle to stop misinformation, but X has been singled out for particular criticism on the issue, with the EU claiming in 2023 it was worse than its peers in terms of spreading falsehoods. The company has previously said it is committed to ""tackling hate speech"" but also wants to ""protect free speech"". The BBC has approached X for comment about this hoax, which appears to be based on a real email sent by Google in 2023. It notified people that Gmail would stop access to its most basic HTML view. The original HTML view was used when Gmail launched in 2004, and would be unrecognisable to most people who use the service nowadays. ""We are reaching out to share an important update about Gmail,"" the viral post reads. ""After years of connecting millions worldwide, enabling seamless communication, and fostering countless connections, the journey of Gmail is coming to a close."" Gmail is the world's most popular email service, with more than 1.5bn active users worldwide, according to Statista . And despite emphatically rejecting the false claims in the hoax message, it is true that Google has shut some services in recent years. In 2023 alone, Google killed its Stadia gaming service, its Snapchat-like YouTube Stories feature, and it began closing old and inactive Gmail accounts. It has announced plans to close Google Podcasts, though this functionality has effectively been supplanted by YouTube Music, which it also owns.",23 February 2024,tech
58,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68374258,Leisure firm told scanning staff faces is illegal,"The data watchdog has ordered a leisure centre group to stop using facial recognition tech to monitor its staff. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) says Serco Leisure has been unlawfully processing the biometric data of more than 2,000 employees at 38 UK leisure facilities. It did so to check staff attendance - a practice the ICO said was ""neither fair nor proportionate"". Serco Leisure says it will comply with the enforcement notice. But it added it had taken legal advice prior to installing the cameras, and said staff had not complained about them during the five years they had been in place. The firm said it was to ""make clocking-in and out easier and simpler"" for workers. ""We engaged with our team members in advance of its roll-out and its introduction was well-received by colleagues,"" the company said in a statement. The ICO said the company's staff - who also have their fingerprints scanned - had not been offered a clear alternative to the gathering of their biometric data. It also found the firm had failed to show why the practice was necessary when there were less intrusive ways of monitoring staff attendance, such as ID cards or fobs. John Edwards, the UK Information Commissioner, said Serco Leisure had increased the ""power imbalance in the workplace"", and left employees feeling like they had no choice but to hand over their biometric data. ""Serco Leisure did not fully consider the risks before introducing biometric technology to monitor staff attendance, prioritising business interests over its employees' privacy,"" he said. ""Biometric data is wholly unique to a person so the risks of harm in the event of inaccuracies or a security breach are much greater - you can't reset someone's face or fingerprint like you can reset a password.,"" he added. The ICO announced it was publishing new guidance for all organisations that are considering using employees' biometric data, showing them how to comply with data protection law. The technology is deeply controversial, with privacy campaigners saying it infringes people's rights , especially as artificial intelligence makes the systems more powerful.

59,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know,Airline held liable for its chatbot giving passenger bad advice - what this means for travellers,"When Air Canada's chatbot gave incorrect information to a traveller, the airline argued its chatbot is ""responsible for its own actions"". Artificial intelligence is having a growing impact on the way we travel, and a remarkable new case shows what AI-powered chatbots can get wrong – and who should pay. In 2022, Air Canada's chatbot promised a discount that wasn't available to passenger Jake Moffatt, who was assured that he could book a full-fare flight for his grandmother's funeral and then apply for a bereavement fare after the fact. According to a civil-resolutions tribunal decision last Wednesday, when Moffatt applied for the discount, the airline said the chatbot had been wrong – the request needed to be submitted before the flight – and it wouldn't offer the discount. Instead, the airline said the chatbot was a ""separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions"". Air Canada argued that Moffatt should have gone to the link provided by the chatbot, where he would have seen the correct policy. The British Columbia Civil Resolution Tribunal rejected that argument, ruling that Air Canada had to pay Moffatt $812.02 (£642.64) in damages and tribunal fees. ""It should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website,"" read tribunal member Christopher Rivers' written response. ""It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot."" The BBC reached out to Air Canada for additional comment and will update this article if and when we receive a response. Gabor Lukacs, president of the Air Passenger Rights consumer advocacy group based in Nova Scotia, told BBC Travel that the case is being considered a landmark one that potentially sets a precedent for airline and travel companies that are increasingly relying on AI and chatbots for customer interactions: Yes, companies are liable for what their tech says and does. ""It establishes a common sense principle: If you are handing over part of your business to AI, you are responsible for what it does,"" Lukacs said. ""What this decision confirms is that airlines cannot hide behind chatbots."" Air Canada is hardly the only airline to dive head-first into AI – or to have a chatbot go off the rails. In 2018, a WestJet chatbot sent a passenger a link to a suicide prevention hotline, for no obvious reason. This type of mistake, in which generative AI tools present inaccurate or nonsensical information, is known as "" AI hallucination "". Beyond airlines, more major travel companies have embraced AI technology, ChatGPT specifically: In 2023, Expedia launched a ChatGPT plug-in to help with trip planning. Lukacs expects the recent tribunal ruling will have broader implications for what airlines can get away with – and highlights the risks for businesses leaning too heavily on AI. In the meantime, how can passengers stand guard against potentially wrong information or ""hallucinations"" fed to them by AI? Should they be fact-checking everything a chatbot says? Experts say: Yes, and no. ""For passengers, the only lesson is that they cannot fully rely on the information provided by airline chatbots. But, it’s not really passengers' responsibility to know that,"" says Marisa Garcia, an aviation industry expert and senior contributor at Forbes. ""Airlines will need to refine these tools further [and] make them far more reliable if they intend for them to ease the workload on human staff or ultimately replace human staff."" Garcia expects that, over time, chatbots and their accuracy will improve, ""but in the meantime airlines will need to ensure they put their customers first and make amends quickly when their chatbots get it wrong,"" she says – rather than let the case get to small claims court and balloon into a PR disaster. Travellers may want to consider the benefits of old-fashioned human help when trip-planning or navigating fares. ""AI has advanced rapidly, but a regulatory framework for guiding the technology has yet to catch up,"" said Erika Richter of the American Society of Travel Advisors. ""Passengers need to be aware that when it comes to AI, the travel industry is building the plane as they're flying it. We're still far off from chatbots replacing the level of customer service required – and expected – for the travel industry."" Globally, protections for airline passengers are not uniform, meaning different countries have different regulations and consumer protections. Lukacs notes that Canadian passenger regulations are particularly weak, while the UK, for example, inherited the Civil Aviation Authority and regulations from the 2004 European Council Directive . ""It's important to understand that this is not simply about the airlines,"" he said. Lukacs recommends passengers who fall victim to chatbot errors take their cases to small claims court. ""They may not be perfect, but overall a passenger has a chance of getting a fair trial."" -- Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook , or follow us on Twitter and Instagram .

60,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68368439,The 'mind-bending' bionic arm powered by AI,"I was born without lower arms and legs, so I've been around prosthetics of all shapes and sizes for as long as I can remember. I've actively avoided those designed for upper arms for most of my adult life, so have never used a bionic hand before. But when I visited a company in California, which is seeking to take the technology to the next level, I was intrigued enough to try one out - and the results were, frankly, mind-bending. Prosthetic limbs have come a long way since the early days when they were fashioned out of wood, tin and leather. Modern-day replacement arms and legs are made of silicone and carbon fibre, and increasingly they are bionic, meaning they have various electronically controlled moving parts to make them more useful to the user. What the company I visited, Atom Limbs, is doing is combining a range of cutting-edge innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), into a next-generation bionic arm. Atom Limbs uses advanced sensors and machine learning - where computers train themselves to become more accurate -  to interpret electrical signals from a person's brain and use them to move and manipulate a prosthetic limb. The arm has a full range of human motion in the elbow, wrist, and individual fingers - and it provides haptic feedback to the wearer on their grip strength. The arm attaches via a strengthened sportswear-style vest which distributes the weight of the arm evenly. Although it still has some weight to it, it is considerably lighter than other bionic arms I've seen. It's non-invasive, meaning it doesn't need any surgery or implants to function. It connects to the wearer's residual limb firstly with bands of sensors that measure electrical signals, and then via a cup that fits over the top, with the arm connecting via an interface. Despite avoiding upper-arm prosthetics before, when Atom Limbs said I could have a try at operating a digital version of the arm on a computer screen, via their control software, I was interested enough to say yes. I do have residual muscles in my arm that I was able to ""assign"" to corresponding hand, wrist and elbow movements, which proved to be a unique, mind-boggling experience. The notion of learning how to control a part of the body I don't have is almost impossible to describe. However, exciting though this technology is, one issue that is always of concern to disabled people when new products come into being is cost. The assistive devices landscape is littered with products that, while impressive, can cost many times an average yearly salary. That puts most devices out of reach for many disabled people who statistics show are more likely to be among the poorest in society. Atom Limbs says it hopes its arm will be positioned around the $20,000 (£15,000) price point, which - while still a hefty sum of money - is considerably less than many other bionic products on the market. Ian Adam, a lecturer in prosthetics and orthotics at the University of Derby, says while this may sound like a lot, it is a good price in the industry - though it won't be for everyone. ""It's at the cheaper end of the market, but say you had an accident and got a pay-out, well that's got to last the rest of your life,"" he said. ""So I think a lot of patients are canny about what they spend their money on... sometimes people are quite prepared to not use them at all - with upper limb prosthetics it can be just an extra thing that not everybody will decide they need to have."" And then there are the ethical and practical issues around such products. In 2022 Britt H Young, herself a bionic arm user, questioned whether the prosthetics ""arms race"" has focused too much on innovation rather than application . Social media star Tilly Lockey, who has been using bionic arms since she was 9 years old, is excited about their future potential - but she told the BBC whether this device made a difference would all come down to testing. ""I've seen like them change so much first-hand, but I've also seen them throughout the development phases,"" she said. ""There's a lot of ambitious projects, but I think the way they truly get there is the back and forth development from the users who actually wear them every day."" Ultimately, the Atom Limbs arm is still early in development. The firm is collecting data ahead of regulatory filings in the US, which means it will be some time yet before we see them being used in every day life.

Other documents hint at successful hacks of public bodies and businesses across Asia and Europe, but it is not yet clear if any were compromised. The identity of the leaker is unknown.

It employs less than 25 staff at its Shanghai headquarters. The collection of 577 documents and chat logs were leaked on GitHub - an online developer platform - on 16 February. Three security researchers told the BBC the leak appeared to be genuine. The files reveal eight years of i-Soon's work to extract data and gain access to systems in the UK, France and several places in Asia - including Taiwan, Pakistan, Malaysia and Singapore. In one case, a government organisation in southwest China paid around $15,000 (£11,900) to access the Vietnamese traffic police's website. In an other case, software to run a disinformation campaign on X, formerly Twitter, was priced at $100,000 (£79,000). In one undated chat log between ""Boss Lu"" and another unnamed user, the UK Foreign Office is revealed to be a priority target for i-Soon. The unnamed participant says they have access to a Foreign Office software vulnerability. However, Boss Lu then says to focus on another organisation because a rival contractor has been awarded the work. In another chat log, a user sends a list of UK targets to i-Soon that include the British Treasury, Chatham House and Amnesty International. ""We don't have this to hand, but we can work on it,"" says the recipient. The pair then discuss prepayment from their client for the unspecified information on the targets. Other chat logs show that i-Soon staff discussed contracts involving Jens Stoltenberg, Nato's secretary general. The leaks potentially offer a rare inside look into a ""commercially-fuelled, high-stakes intelligence operation,"" says John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence. The data shows how the contractors serve ""not only one agency, but multiple agencies at once,"" he adds. Experts say there could be many motives behind the data leak. It could be a disgruntled former employee, a foreign intelligence agency, or a malicious leak by a competitor to undermine i-Soon's public credibility. The workings of China's cyber espionage campaign have been reported on extensively, but this leak shines light on the unusual way in which the private sector is involved in those campaigns. It is unlikely that the outcome of investigations by the Chinese authorities will ever be made public says Dakota Cary, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub.

Hi-Fi Rush and pirate game Sea of Thieves are coming to Sony's PS5 only. Meanwhile, narrative adventure game Pentiment and co-op game Grounded will be on PS5 as well as Nintendo Switch. It follows Microsoft's announcement in February that four Xbox exclusives would soon appear on rival platforms, in what some considered a major change of direction for the industry , Until now, it had not been known what those titles were. Two of the games were revealed on Wednesday in a Nintendo Direct, an online showcase for the firm, before Microsoft confirmed the full list in a blog post. ""These multiplayer titles available will bring more people together and continue to grow their communities of players,"" said head of Xbox game studios Matt Booty. Neil Watton, editor of TheXboxHub, said fans would not be too surprised by the names of the games that were chosen to appear on other consoles, after several weeks of rumours. ""It's those jumping into Grounded and Sea of Thieves who will ultimately be rewarded, with full cross-play across platforms building the player base immediately on launch in April,"" he told the BBC. ""When you consider the depth of the cooperative play found in those titles, the moves make complete and utter sense."" Several other upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch were also revealed during Nintendo's event, including a new Endless Ocean game, Monster Hunter Stories, and a remake of 2010 Disney hit Epic Mickey. Viewers were also surprised by the developers of the 2017 hit, Sonic Mania, unexpectedly announcing their latest game. Penny's Big Breakaway, made by Evening Star, is a platform game with a distinctively 1990s look. ""I think the 3D platformer genre at the moment is actually in a bit of a renaissance"", the developer's director Christian Whitehead told the BBC. ""There's a lot to choose from, even just on Steam and Nintendo Switch"", he added. Evening Star was formed by many of the people who worked on Sonic Mania as independent contractors. That game was a hit in 2017, picking up an average score of 86 on review aggregator Metacritic alongside a nomination at that year's Game Awards. Though a sequel to that game was highly anticipated by fans it never came to pass, and Sega instead released Sonic Superstars in 2023, made by Sonic's original designer . Sonic and Mario - the mascots of Sega and Nintendo - were considered rivals in the 1990s, but after Sega stopped making its own consoles in the 2000s, it began releasing Sonic on rival consoles. Nowadays, Sonic games appear on Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft hardware. Argick, a Scottish Twitch streamer with about 20,000 followers, said he planned on spending his evening playing Penny's Big Breakaway on stream. ""Sonic Mania was a phenomenal critical success, fans and critics loved it,"" he told the BBC. ""Just looking at the footage for Penny's Big Breakaway, it looks really smooth, fluid, speedy and fun - really simple to pick up and play. ""But it's also really silly and not taking itself too seriously."" Elsewhere on Wednesday, gamers less interested in Nintendo updates were treated to a trailer for the upcoming expansion to 2022 Game of the Year award winner Elden Ring.

Despite the technique's popularity, experts have long warned against it, with tests suggesting it doesn't work. And now the tech giant itself has published guidance telling users it could result in small particles of the grain damaging their devices. The firm said people should instead gently tap out any liquid, with the phone connector facing down, then leave it to dry out. Despite the increasing sophistication of smartphones, popular approaches for fixing them if they have been dropped in water remain rather unsophisticated. Apple has taken the opportunity to steer users away from several of them. As well as avoiding bags of rice, it also advises against drying a wet phone using an ""external heat source or compressed air"", meaning radiators and hairdryers should be avoided. Nor, it suggests, should users try inserting ""a foreign object, such as a cotton swab or a paper towel"" into their phone. Instead, it guides people to leave their phone in a ""dry area with some airflow"" before reconnecting it to a charger. As the website MacWorld - which first spotted the new support document - notes, the changing design of smartphones may mean all such advice will be unnecessary in the future. That is because devices are increasingly able to withstand getting wet. All Apple devices from the iPhone 12 onwards are able to withstand immersion up to a depth of six metres, for up to half an hour. But with cost-of-living pressures driving growth in the global second-hand mobile market , it is likely that many people will need advice on what to do - and what not to - with a soggy smartphone for some time yet.",21 February 2024,tech

Anyone who signs up to the voluntary scheme will get an icon on their profile, verifying their age and likeness are authentic. The dating app has been repeatedly targeted by fraudsters. The charity Victim Support said the move was welcome but added platforms like Tinder needed to ""go further"". ""Ensuring ID verification is mandatory across all dating apps, rather than optional, would be more robust,"" charity spokesman Wayne Stevens told the BBC. ""Romance fraud is a devastating crime, particularly because of the shame and stigma around it."" The fraud - also known as catfishing - involves a person entering a relationship while pretending to be someone else. Their goal can be to deceive someone into a romantic relationship, often with the aim of scamming money from them. There have been calls for tougher action to combat the practice. Tinder says the system it is introducing should give users more confidence that the people they meet on the app are who they say they are. It will see users who verify a photo receiving a blue camera icon badge, and those who prove their ID is authentic getting a blue ID icon badge. Anyone who completes both steps will be given a blue checkmark. The system was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 2023. The firm says those who chose to be verified in these countries were far more likely to get a match - with a 67% increase in matches compared with unverified users. Along with the UK, the tool is also being brought in for people based in the US, Brazil and Mexico. It is not the first such initiative from the app - which has been downloaded more than half a billion times, and describes itself as the ""world's most popular app for meeting new people."" It has previously tried to verify people through selfies as well as giving blue checkmarks to celebrities .",20 February 2024,tech
65,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68344987,Lockbit: UK leads disruption of major cyber-criminal gang,"The UK has led an operation to disrupt what is thought to be the world's largest criminal ransomware group. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has infiltrated systems belonging to Lockbit and stolen its data. The organisation is believed to be based in Russia and, by volume, be the most prolific ransomware group selling services to other criminals. On Monday evening, a message appeared on Lockbit's website, saying it was ""now under control of law enforcement"". The operation is being billed as one of the most significant disruptions of the cyber-criminal world. The FBI, Europol and other countries have also been involved in the long-running operation but it is the first of its kind to be led by the UK. Criminals use Lockbit to hack into computers belonging to companies and organisations and lock users out until a ransom is paid. They often also steal data and threaten to release it. The group emerged around 2019 and has established itself as a dominant player. Some estimates suggest it holds around 20-25% of the market for ransomware. Among the high-profile reported targets of Lockbit are Royal Mail, which was hit in January 2023 , disrupting international deliveries. Last November, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was also hit with major repercussions in the financial world. Others reported to have been hit include suppliers to the NHS, law firm Allen & Overy and Boeing, the aerospace company. The operation has been under way covertly for some time, with law enforcement gathering data before moving to a more public phase on Monday evening. The NCA's technical experts had been able to get inside of Lockbit's own systems and take control. In doing so, they were able to steal a large amount of the criminal group's own data about its activities. Since many companies do not admit they have been hacked and sometimes pay a ransom, this data may well provide a unique insight into the true scale of the group's work as well. As they moved into the more open phase of the operation, law enforcement went public about their infiltration. They took control of the site on the dark web, where Lockbit publicised its activities and replaced it with the emblems of the various law enforcement agencies and a message reading: ""The site is under the control of the National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close co-operation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, 'Operation Cronos'."" At a press conference on Tuesday morning, the head of the NCA, Graeme Biggar, said it assessed the group was responsible for 25% of ransomware attacks in the last year. He suggested the incidents had led to losses totalling billions. He said there were thousands of victims globally, including 200 that were known of in the UK - though he added that in reality there may have been many more. Lockbit works by selling its criminal services, acting as a one-stop shop to customers known as affiliates. These affiliates pay to be able to carry out the hacking operations and receive both the malicious software and advice. But following the action by law enforcement, the affiliates who tried to log into the site were greeted with another message explaining that Lockbit's internal data was now in the hands of law enforcement, including details of victims, the amount of money extorted ""and much, much more"". The message adds: ""We may be in touch with you very soon."" There have been so-called ""take-downs"" in the past but in many cases the criminal groups re-emerged soon after their online operations were disrupted by law enforcement, limiting the long-term impact. But in this case, those behind the operation are hoping to have a more significant impact by undermining the credibility of the group and attacking its reputation. The group relies heavily on branding. It has even paid people to have the Lockbit brand tattooed on their bodies. The aim is to sow distrust by making affiliates realise that law enforcement now has their details and drive a wedge between them and those who run Lockbit by making other criminals believe it is a risk to work with them in the future for fear law enforcement is watching. Those directly involved in the operation say they believe the UK will be significantly safer in the short and medium term from cyber-attack and describe the move as a 'step change' in the response to cyber-crime. ""On the face of it, this is one of the most consequential disruptions ever undertaken against one of the giants of ransomware, and certainly by far the biggest ever led by British police,"" Ciaran Martin, the former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre told the BBC. ""There are few, if any, bigger players than Lockbit in ransomware, and the NCA seem to have wholly 'owned' them, as we say in cyber security"", he added. Those behind the Lockbit group are believed to be based in Russia which means, like other similar groups, they are beyond the reach of law enforcement for arrest. That means disruption is often the only realistic option to try and undermine their work, as well as improving cyber-defences. When the FBI carried out a similar operation against a group called Blackcat last year, it resulted in a tussle over control of the site between the group and US law enforcement, a sign that these operations do not always go exactly to plan. But the hope is that this operation, with its very public exposure of Lockbit's activities, will disrupt them enough to prevent a quick return.",20 February 2024,tech
66,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68316683,Big tech vows action on 'deceptive' AI in elections,"Most of the world's largest tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have agreed to tackle what they are calling deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) in elections. The twenty firms have signed an accord committing them to fighting voter-deceiving content. They say they will deploy technology to detect and counter the material. But one industry expert says the voluntary pact will ""do little to prevent harmful content being posted"". The Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections was announced at the Munich Security Conference on Friday. The issue has come into sharp focus because it is estimated up to four billion people will be voting this year in countries such as the US, UK and India. Among the accord's pledges are commitments to develop technology to ""mitigate risks"" related to deceptive election content generated by AI, and to provide transparency to the public about the action firms have taken. Other steps include sharing best practice with one another and educating the public about how to spot when they might be seeing manipulated content. Signatories include social media platforms X - formerly Twitter - Snap, Adobe and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. However, the accord has some shortcomings, according to computer scientist Dr Deepak Padmanabhan, from Queen's University Belfast, who has co-authored a paper on elections and AI. He told the BBC it was promising to see the companies acknowledge the wide range of challenges posed by AI. But he said they needed to take more ""proactive action"" instead of waiting for content to be posted before then seeking to take it down. That could mean that ""more realistic AI content, that may be more harmful, may stay on the platform for longer"" compared to obvious fakes which are easier to detect and remove, he suggested. Dr Padmanabhan also said the accord's usefulness was undermined because it lacked nuance when it came to defining harmful content. He gave the example of jailed Pakistani politician Imran Khan using AI to make speeches while he was in prison. ""Should this be taken down too?"" he asked. The accord's signatories say they will target content which ""deceptively fakes or alters the appearance, voice, or actions"" of key figures in elections. It will also seek to deal with audio, images or videos which provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can vote. ""We have a responsibility to help ensure these tools don't become weaponised in elections,"" said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft. On Wednesday, the US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, told the BBC that AI threatened to ""supercharge"" disinformation at elections . Google and Meta have previously set out their policies on AI-generated images and videos in political advertising, which require advertisers to flag when they are using deepfakes or content which has been manipulated by AI.",16 February 2024,tech
67,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68304967,"Xbox, Nintendo or PlayStation: does it still matter?","Four Microsoft Xbox video games - and the firm was frustratingly careful not to name them - will now be opened up to alternative platforms for the first time,  boss Phil Spencer announced to the world last night. He gave only a couple of clues: all four are community-driven, more than one year old, and they do not include recent releases Starfield or Indiana Jones. This feels like a big change of gear for Microsoft, which has long favoured exclusivity to its own Xbox platform and Games Pass subscription service. So what's behind the shift and what does it tell us about the future of gaming? Let's start with a 12 year old I know - my son. He loves Minecraft, and plays it wherever he can. On his phone, on his tablet, on our PlayStation, on his dad's Xbox. He watches Minecraft videos on YouTube and he uses an unofficial app to create and share skins and mods. He doesn't care who owns the game (Microsoft bought the Mojang studio in 2014) and he has no brand loyalty to a particular device - his favourite is whichever one is to hand. This is what the games giants are up against: a generation of young gamers who don't buy into their hype. It appears that Microsoft is starting, very cautiously, to respond to that. Last night Mr Spencer insisted the four latest games did not signify a fundamental change in the firm's games strategy. But then he added: ""I have a fundamental belief that in the next five to 10 years, exclusive games, which are exclusive to one piece of hardware, are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the games industry."" And it's not just Xbox warming to the idea - there have been similar rumblings from Sony. In a recent earnings call, interim gaming president Hiroki Totoki said that he wanted to put more PlayStation games onto other platforms. Much like Microsoft, he did not name any particular games, or specific platforms. It is possible he meant the firm would continue with the status quo of putting PlayStation games onto PC several months or even years after their release. Following years of fierce rivalry between the two firms, and expensive acquisitions of successful games studios producing the most popular games, in an attempt to lock in the best content to their own customers, this is definitely a change of heart (Nintendo meanwhile, still has more of a tendency to keep its games to itself). The idea of basically turning any device with a screen into your company's console is blisteringly simple, when you think about it. Why go through the expensive and time-consuming process of building and selling proprietary hardware when so many people are essentially carrying around a high-performance computer already, in the form of their phones? Why restrict access to your best-selling titles when there's a vast audience with alternative devices out there who also want to buy them, play them, and pay for in-game extras? The analysts Ampere estimated that in 2023 there were a total of around 46.5m consoles sold, of which only 7.6m were Microsoft's Xbox. That leaves nearly 39 million gamers that Xbox exclusives such as the long awaited Starfield from Bethesda, didn't reach. You begin to see that this is an old-fashioned business model, with an old-fashioned motive: money. ""The key reason Microsoft has been pursuing a more progressive multi-platform strategy with its games content and services since early in the Xbox One cycle is because it was unable to build on the relative success of the Xbox 360 era and take market share from Sony, and latterly, Nintendo post-the launch of the Switch,"" says analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere. In addition Microsoft has been busy hoovering up successful games studios for large amounts of cash - at a time when making games is already an expensive business. Indeed, during its contentious $68bn acquisition of the massive games maker Activision Blizzard, one of Sony's chief objections was that it could make smash hits like Call of Duty, played by millions on PlayStations, Xbox-exclusives. Microsoft was forced to promise that it would not do so for at least 10 years. There has even been speculation that Microsoft might be preparing to walk away from the hardware market altogether, abandoning the Xbox console entirely, but Mr Harding-Rolls doesn't think something that dramatic is on the horizon. ""Ampere does not expect Microsoft to exit the console platform business in the medium term as that would leave a gaping hole in its games-related revenues,"" he added. Indeed, Xbox president Sarah Bond even teased the idea of some brand new hardware in a podcast released by Microsoft on Thursday. ""What we're really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation,"" she said. Unfortunately, your guess about that at this stage is as good as ours, although the rumour mill is going into overdrive that it could be some kind of handheld device, designed to compete with the huge success of the Nintendo Switch. In any case Darren Edwards from gaming news website TheXboxHub sums it up neatly: ""It's hardly a doomsday scenario for Xbox."" As for the games themselves, Microsoft's preferred gateway is via Games Pass. For £12.99 per month, it offers unlimited streaming access to hundreds of titles. The firm has been very quiet for a while about subscriber numbers, but tonight revealed it had hit 34m. It launched in 2017 with an ambition to hit 100m by 2030, a goal that still feels some way off, with six years to go. But it's still good news for those making games which are on the Games Pass, like the UK-based publisher No More Robots. ""We want as many people on Game Pass as possible, because that naturally leads to more people playing our titles, which is especially useful for multiplayer titles that require larger player counts to keep the community alive,"" said director Mike Rose. Needless to say there are also a lot of relieved Xbox owners on social media right now. Many felt the announcement was an anti-climax after days of anticipation, and it certainly threw up more questions than answers. But at least the message was more business as usual than console bonfire. One gamer on X summed up the most popular view: ""Xbox isn't going away or going 3rd party. Can we all chill now?""

Her original claim was refused, in 2023, but a revised version has now been accepted, with early 2026 said to be the latest it could be heard. Meta said the claims ""remain entirely without merit and we will vigorously defend against them"". The new claim says: ""Facebook has struck an unfair bargain with its users,"" according to legal documents . Facebook abused its dominance by making users give it their data from non-Facebook products, including Meta-owned Instagram and other third-party sites. And sharing data with third parties had become ""a condition of accessing the Facebook platform, pursuant to a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer"". Facebook is free to use but carries advertisements. The more data it has on its users, the better it can target adverts - and the more it can charge. The claim is seeking £2.07-3.1bn compensation for those who had Facebook accounts between February 2016 and October 2023. It will be heard at the Competition Appeal Tribunal . Meta said the ""fundamental concerns identified by the tribunal in its February 2023 judgement have not been resolved"". It was ""committed to giving people meaningful control"" of the information they shared on its platforms and to ""invest heavily to create tools that allow them to do so."" The legal action is being funded by Innsworth, a company backed by an investment management fund, which has also funded mass legal actions against Mastercard, Ericsson and Volkswagen.

69,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240215-why-insects-are-drawn-to-artificial-light-at-night,Why insects are drawn to artificial light at night,"New research finds that artificial lights confuse rather than attract insects. High up in the mountains of Monteverde, Costa Rica, a team of researchers lug heavy equipment including two high-speed cameras deep into a dream-like cloud forest . As the cool mist rolls in along with the darkness of twilight, they set up a light source and cameras a few metres away, then power up their computers, sync them to the cameras and wait, letting their eyes adjust. The team in Costa Rica spent several weeks huddled under a tarp in thick jumpers, getting bitten by mosquitoes and horseflies all in the name of answering a question that's eluded science for hundreds of years – why do insects flock to light at night ? Some scientists believed they were simply attracted to the light source. Others thought it might be the warmth of the light pulling them in. Even more felt they were mistaking artificial light for the light of the sky which they use to navigate. The unusual flight patterns the field researchers observed, however, pointed to a different hypothesis: the insects are trapped by artificial light because they think it will help stabilise them. The scientists from Imperial College London and Florida International University used motion-sensor cameras which allowed them to see how the insects were traveling in 3D space. This revealed a strange behaviour: the insects appeared trapped in orbit around the light source with their backs to it. This is called a dorsal light response – where animals keep their top side, or back, facing the brightest object in their range of vision. Since insects are too lightweight to use ground reaction forces (the force exerted by the ground on a body) to orient themselves in space as humans do, and are often in flight, they need to rely on a different stable source to know which way is up. At night, that used to be the moon and stars – until humans invented artificial light. ""The insects treat a point light source at night very much in the same way as they would treat the sky during the day. And so the sky, no matter where you are, is always overhead,"" says Samuel Fabian, co-author of the study and a postdoctoral research associate in bioengineering at Imperial College London.  A point light source, such as a lamp, however, forces insects to keep reorienting to face away from it and continue to curve around it in an endless loop. Think of it like a plane when it tilts to turn — the force of the forward acceleration and lift of the plane creates a curving motion. So what normally helps keep insects aligned with the horizon ends up turning them on their heads, literally. Fabian participated in both the field study in Costa Rica with his research partner Yash Sondhi , a postdoctoral research associate in entomology at the University of Florida, and the lab study. The lab study was conducted similarly but in a large flight arena with eight high-speed, infrared cameras. Rather than just observe insects' behaviour in their natural habitat, he could essentially turn the smaller bugs into data points by putting 1mm markers on their backs. ""Since the cameras have strobe lights that are firing at the same time as they're taking pictures, the tiny little markers [become] bright spots for the camera,"" says Fabian. This allows the cameras to then send what they read as data points straight to the computer, leading to what Fabian calls ""crazy levels of accuracy"". You might also like: Despite the discrepancies in methodology, the researchers saw the same sort of behaviour over and over again, across dozens of different types of insects, from dragonflies to fruit flies. The back-facing orbiting seems to disprove previous theories on why insects congregate by artificial light at night (ALAN), even one of the most popular theories – that insects were mistaking ALAN for the moon, which scientists argue they use as a sort of compass. ""The way you navigate by the moon is it's so far away that when you walk, the moon just appears to hover in the sky for you and so it's a good indication of whether you've turned or not, especially for flying,"" says Jamie Theobald, a co-author of the recent study and associate professor of biological sciences at Florida International University. This theory, however, doesn't explain all the peculiar patterns the researchers observed during their field and lab work. Aside from orbiting, Fabian says they witnessed stalling (where an insect appears to fly straight up around the side of the light, then loses momentum and falls back down as if it were a pendulum), and flying directly over the light while inverted. That last behaviour is why Fabian and Sondhi consider flood lights to be the worst light pollution offenders – the beams of light that fill a large area cause insects to flip upside down abruptly, leading to a lot of catastrophic crash landings. (Read more about how light pollution affects plants' senses ) . ALAN is bad for insects across the board; it diverts them from the activities that keep them healthy and alive – pollinating or eating , mating, and evading predators. ""Artificial light can also confuse an insect's sense of time and make it difficult to know where they are within a day or a year, which has all sorts of ramifications for activity and development, respectively,"" says Avalon Owens, an entomologist and research fellow at the Rowland Institute at Harvard University. A review of 229 studies on light pollution found that ALAN is a major driver of insect population loss . And, as light pollution continues to grow in tandem with ever-expanding urbanisation (about 10 % annually ), increasing losses will follow. This could severely impact crops that rely on insects for pollination, hobbling food supplies for larger animals, including humans. Fabian, Sondhi and Owens stress that there is a simple solution, however: use less ALAN. Or, if you must use it, avoid flood lights, use LEDs on warmer settings, and put lights on timers. Sondhi also points to a soon-to-be-published German study that showed shielding or shrouding lights , which minimise glare by shining downwards, ""helped reduce insect catch around the light by [about] 70 to 80%"". Several cities around the world are already taking steps to reduce their ALAN. Middletown, Ohio is converting thousands of street lamp lights to LEDs which can be programmed to cast warmer light. Nineteen other states have laws in place to reduce or shield ALAN, and several countries in the EU have implemented similar, nationwide laws. The next chapter of this work for Fabian and Sondhi will involve testing the parameters of how far this light effect goes; does it pull insects from kilometres away, or just metres? ""I don't think anyone has explained this satisfactorily to date – which is exciting because there is still much to be learned on this topic,"" says Owens. ""The direction of light is really important,"" says Fabian. ""If we don't want to influence large amounts of insect populations, we should not have lights shining up into the sky."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

70,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68297336,Offenders confused about ethics of AI child sex abuse,"A charity that helps people worried about their own thoughts or behaviour says an increasing number of callers are feeling confused about the ethics of viewing AI child abuse imagery. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation (LFF) says AI images are acting as a gateway. The charity is warning that creating or viewing such images is still illegal even if the children are not real. Neil, not his real name, contacted the helpline after being arrested for creating AI images. The 43-year-old denied that he had any sexual attraction to children. The IT worker, who used AI software to make his own indecent images of children using text prompts, said he would never view such images of real children because he is not attracted to them. He claimed simply to be fascinated by the technology. He called the LFF to try to understand his thoughts, and call handlers reminded him that his actions are illegal, regardless of whether or not the children are real. The charity says it has had similar calls from others who are expressing confusion. Another caller got in touch after discovering that her 26-year-old partner viewed indecent AI images of children, but said they were not serious because the pictures ""aren't real"". The offender has since asked for help. A teacher asked for the charity's advice because her 37-year-old partner was viewing images that seemed illegal, but neither of them was sure if they were. The LFF's Donald Findlater says some callers to its confidential Stop It Now helpline think that AI images are blurring the boundaries for what is illegal and morally wrong. ""This is a dangerous view. Some offenders think this material is in some way OK to create or view because there are no children being harmed, but this is wrong,"" he says. In some cases, AI abuse images might also be wrongly labelled or advertised as AI-made and the difference in realism is becoming harder to spot. Mr Findlater says that deviant sexual fantasy is the strongest predictor of reoffending for anyone convicted of a sexual crime. ""If you feed that deviant fantasy, then you're making it more likely you're going to do harm to children,"" he said. The charity says the number of callers citing AI images as a reason for their offending remains low, but is rising. The foundation is urging society to recognise the problem and lawmakers to do something to reduce the ease in which child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is made and published online. Although the charity would not name any specific sites where it has found the imagery, one popular AI art website has been accused of allowing users to publish sexual and graphic images of very young models. When the BBC approached Civit.ai about the issue in November, the firm said it takes potential CSAM on the site ""very seriously"" and asks the community to report images that users consider to ""depict under-age characters/people in a mature or photorealistic context"". The LFF also warned that young people are creating CSAM without realising the seriousness of the offence. One caller, for example, was concerned about his 12-year-old son who had used an AI app to create inappropriate topless pictures of friends, and then subsequently searched for terms such as ""naked teen"" online. Criminal cases in Spain and the US have recently been launched against young boys using declothing apps to create naked pictures of school friends. In the UK, Graeme Biggar, head of the National Crime Agency, said in December that he wanted to see tougher sentences for offenders who possess child abuse imagery, adding that AI abuse imagery ""matters, because we assess that the viewing of these images - whether real or AI-generated - materially increases the risk of offenders moving on to sexually abusing children themselves"".

71,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68293896,Google joins mission to map methane from space,"Tech giant Google is backing a satellite project due to launch in March which will collect data about methane levels around the world. The new satellite will orbit 300 miles about the Earth, 15 times per day. Methane gas is believed by scientists to be a major contributor to global warming, because it traps in heat. A lot of methane is produced by farming and waste disposal, but the Google project will focus on methane emissions at oil and gas plants. Firms extracting oil and gas regularly burn or vent methane. The new project is a collaboration between Google and the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit global climate group. The data captured by the satellite will be processed by the tech giant's artificial intelligence tools and used to generate a methane map aimed at identifying methane leaks on oil and gas infrastructure around the world. But the firm said if it identified a significant leak it would not specifically notify the company which owned the infrastructure responsible for it. ""Our job is to make information available,"" it said, adding that governments and regulators would be among those with access to it and it would be for them to force any changes."" There is no international rule on controlling methane emissions. The EU has agreed a set of proposals aimed at reducing them, which includes forcing oil and gas operators to repair leaks. In the coal sector, flaring will be banned in member states from 2025. Google's map, which will be published on its Earth Engine, will not be in real time, with data sent back from the satellite every few weeks. In 2017, the European Space Agency launched a similar satellite instrument called Tropomi , which charts the presence of trace gases in the atmosphere, including methane. It was a mission with a minimum seven-year life span, which means it could end this year. Carbon Mapper, which uses Tropomi data, released a report in 2022 indicating that the biggest methane plumes were seen in Turkmenistan, Russia and the US - but cloud cover meant the data did not include Canada or China. Google said it hoped its project would ""fill gaps between existing tools"". Despite various tracking efforts, methane levels remain concerningly high. Nasa says levels of the gas have more than doubled in the last 200 years, and that 60% of it is created by human activity. A major contributor to that percentage is livestock: specifically cows. Because of the way they digest their food, cow burps and farts contain methane. In 2020 the US Environmental Protection Agency published a report that said a single cow could produce 154-264 pounds of methane gas every year. It added that there were believed to be about 1.5 billion cows raised for their meat worldwide. ""Satellites are great for finding the really big, massive culprits"" of methane emissions, said Peter Thorne, professor of physical geography at Maynooth University in Ireland. But detecting more diffuse methane sources, such as those emanating from agriculture, is more difficult, he added.",14 February 2024,tech
72,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68282737,Meta boss Zuckerberg takes a swipe at rival Apple,"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken a personal swipe at rival company Apple's new headset. The Vision Pro grabbed headlines as celebrities including Diplo and T-Pain wore it in public, with the ""passthrough"" feature allowing them to see their surroundings while using it. But in a video shot using the Meta Quest 3's own passthrough, Zuckerberg insisted his company's headset is ""the best product, period"". Apple has been approached for comment. Passthrough is a feature used by the most recent mixed reality headsets, which allows people to see beyond the screen strapped to their head. By utilising cameras on the outside of the headset, users are given a live, high-definition video feed of their surroundings - meaning they can wear a headset while walking or exercising. Meta has been working on this technology for the better part of a decade, and it also features on rival products such as Sony's PlayStation VR 2. But it is clearly the source of frustration for Zuckerberg that the Vision Pro is being praised over technology that exists elsewhere. ""I think Quest is the better product, period,"" he said. ""It seems like there are a lot of people who just assumed that Vision Pro would be higher quality because it's Apple and it costs $3,000 (£2,400) more. ""But honestly, I'm pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for with that price differential."" It comes as several people have started to post on social media about returning their Apple headsets, with product manager Parker Ortolani among those praising the device but saying the ""physical trade-offs are just not worth it"". Zuckerberg spent much of the video trying to stress why the Quest 3 was better, with reasons ranging from the ability to move around easily without a cable, and socialising - but above all making multiple digs at the difference in price. ""I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people since it's really good and it's like seven times less expensive,"" he said. ""I think it's just a lot more comfortable, and we designed it to weigh 120 grams less which makes a really big difference on your face. ""There's no wires that get in the way when you move around - it's a big deal."" He also said the Quest 3 had a wider field of view, and he believed it had a brighter screen too. Zuckerberg did accept the Vision Pro had some advantages - in particular a higher resolution - but said he was ""surprised by how many trade-offs they had to make"" in other areas to achieve it. He also praised the eye-tracking on Apple's headset, which is a feature not present in the Quest 3. Zuckerberg ended the video by talking about what mixed reality might look like in the future. In a surprising move, he directly criticised ""fanboys"" who ""get upset whenever anyone dares to question if Apple's going to be the leader"" in a type of technology. ""But the reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed model,"" he said, referring to how Apple controls what can and can't be installed on its devices. ""And yeah, in mobile, Apple's closed model won, but it's not always that way - if you go back to the PC era, Microsoft's open model was the winner. ""In this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again.""",14 February 2024,tech
73,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68288150,Ransomware attack hits dozens of Romanian hospitals,"Over a hundred Romanian healthcare facilities have been been affected by a ransomware attack, with some doctors forced to resort to pen and paper. Children's and emergency hospitals were among those hit, with other facilities going offline as a precaution. The cyber extortionists demanded 3.5 Bitcoin, worth over £130,000, to unlock vital files which they had encrypted. But Romanian cyber officials said data had been recently backed up, reducing the impact. The attack largely unfolded overnight on Monday, according to a statement from the Romanian Ministry of Health and had targeted a widely used medical information system. The incident was under investigation by IT specialists, including cyber security experts from the National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC), the ministry said. According to the DNSC, 25 hospitals were affected by the attack, starting with the The Pitesti Paediatric Hospital. The organisation said that 79 other healthcare facilities were taken offline while investigations were carried out to determine if they had been affected. While officials had identified the type of malware used, the group responsible has yet to be identified. The ransom demand includes only an email address, officials wrote. As most of the targeted hospitals have recent backups of data from the affected servers, it is expected that the facilities should be able to bounce back fairly rapidly. But the impact on patients is likely to be profound as dozens more hospitals have had to switch off internet connected devices as a precaution. This could, in theory, affect not just booking and records but also machines like MRI scanners. The UK experienced a similar attack in 2017 which disrupted 80 out of 236 hospital trusts across England and caused nearly 7000 appointments to be cancelled or rearranged. Following that incident the NHS accepted that there were ""lessons to be learned"", and made a number of changes.",13 February 2024,tech

75,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240212-dna-testing-what-happens-if-your-genetic-data-is-hacked,DNA testing: What happens if your genetic data is hacked?,"The personal information of millions of people who sent swabs of their DNA to consumer testing services have been leaked in high profile hacks in recent years, leading to questions about how secure that genetic data is. What is the most personal thing a criminal could ever steal? Your wedding ring? Your phone? What about your genetic code? In autumn 2023, a hacker called Golem posted on a well-known message board for cybercriminals, announcing a trove of data stolen from 23andMe , one of the biggest names in at-home DNA testing. The company later acknowledged that the hacker had gained access to personal information in 6.9 million of its users' profiles . It seemed to be an ethnically targeted attack: Golem boasted about having access to the accounts of people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage who had sent their DNA to 23andMe, and offered to sell it to whoever was prepared to pay. News began to circulate suggesting the data breach on Friday 6 October 2023 may have even had antisemitic motivations. A post purportedly from Golem offered for sale ""tailored ethnic groupings, individualized data sets, pinpointed origin estimations, haplogroup details, phenotype information, photographs, links to hundreds of potential relatives, and, most crucially, raw data profiles"". There was a graduated pricing scale, ranging from 100 profiles for $1,000 (£790) to 100,000 profiles for $100,000 (£79,000). ""On offer are DNA profiles of millions, ranging from the world's top business magnates to dynasties often whispered about in conspiracies,"" the post continued . It has since been deleted. Fourteen million people have spat into a vial and sent their DNA off to 23andMe to be analysed, in search of insights into their ancestry and health. Many do it without thinking too much about what they are giving away: my series investigating the unforeseen consequences of at-home DNA testing for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds is entitled The Gift because we give these kits casually as Christmas and birthday presents. The company's stated mission is: ""To help people access, understand, and benefit from the human genome."" I took a 23andMe test while recording the series – and it revealed my own Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. But now it seems my data could be part of the package a hacker has been trying to sell for financial benefit. It led me to wonder if information as sensitive as our genetic code can ever be kept safe online. Data breaches happen all the time, says Brett Callow, a threat analyst with cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. ""These incidents are very common and no company is immune,"" he says. But genetic information is a very special kind of data: while you can change your passwords, credit card number or bank details if they fall into the hands of a hacker, you can't change the sequence of your DNA. ""When your DNA data gets breached, there is absolutely nothing you can do about it,"" says Callow.  The targeting of any group on the basis of what their DNA reveals about their ethnic heritage would be deeply worrying. The potential targeting of individuals with Jewish and Chinese heritage in the 23andMe breach has been raised by a number of leading figures in the US, including the attorney general in Connecticut and a member of the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions . The purported ability of Jews to blend in – to ""pass"" as white – has been at the root of antisemitic conspiracy theories . During the Holocaust, the Nazis forced Jews to wear yellow stars so they could be immediately identifiable. A data breach that included ethnicity estimates given in ancestry reports could mean that Jewish people who had taken a DNA test could potentially have a permanent digital yellow star next to their names, photographs and geographical location. With the data of half 23andMe's customers now in the hands of cybercriminals, the breach clearly affected far more than just Ashkenazi Jewish account holders. Indeed, in subsequent posts on the hackers forum, Golem supposedly offered the data of British, German and Chinese 23andMe users, as well as that of 23andMe chief executive Anne Wojcicki , her ex-husband and Google founder Sergey Brin, Elon Musk and members of the British Royal Family. For Callow, this was never an antisemitic attack. ""I don't believe the attack was motivated racially, ethnically, or anything like that,"" he says. ""The reference to Jewish people in this post was to attract attention, to get more eyeballs."" Lily Hay Newman, a writer at Wired focusing on hacking, agrees. ""It's common to try to package and market your data to try to get other criminals to buy it, to make it seem valuable and appealing,"" she says. When news of the 23andMe data breach first broke, the reaction was relatively muted: the attention of Jewish groups was focused on the attacks Hamas had launched on Israel that weekend, and the rise in antisemitic hate incidents in the weeks that followed it. Technology journalists who monitor the hacking forum approached 23andMe for comment, and the company issued a statement . No raw genetic data was leaked, they said, but general categories, such as sex, birth year and genetic ancestry results and geographical location had got into the hands of a so-called ""threat actor"". I asked 23andMe for an interview. They declined to put anyone forward, instead directing me to a blog posted on their website they have been updating since news of the data breach first broke. ""The threat actor was able to access less than 0.1%, or roughly 14,000 user accounts, of the existing 14 million 23andMe customers through credential stuffing,"" the 23andMe statement said. ""That is, usernames and passwords that were used on 23andMe.com were the same as those used on other websites that have been previously compromised or otherwise available."" In other words, the problem was 23andMe customers reusing passwords that hackers had managed to get hold of from other sites. Credential stuffing is not hacking, in its strictest sense. ""It's attackers using stolen login credentials, like a username and password or an email address and password, to walk in the front door of the account. So really, there's no hacking required,"" says Newman. ""But it's really established that passwords are very difficult for users to manage, and that the blame shouldn't be on users."" The 23andMe hack turned out to involve far more than the 14,000 accounts the company initially claimed had been compromised. Once those accounts had been infiltrated, the hacker was able to amass a much larger trove of data through the DNA Relatives feature of 23andMe, which allows account holders to connect with genetic relations. It's a popular feature - that's why many people take these tests, after all. In response to inquiries from journalists at TechCrunch in December 2023, 23andMe admitted that in fact the data of 6.9 million users – roughly one out every two people who had sent their DNA to the company – had been breached. When databases hold very sensitive information, it generally takes more than a single password to access it – think about logging into your online bank account, for example. Most of us are now very used to two-factor verification – which uses an additional step such as a code received in a text message or on an authenticator app – when we use our credit cards or view confidential documents online. But prior to October 2023 this wasn't a necessary requirement to access an account on 23andMe, even though it held genetic ancestry data coupled with geographical and biographical information. Yet, it isn't the first time at-home DNA testing companies have had their databases hacked. In 2018, the email addresses and passwords of over 92 million users of MyHeritage were leaked . The October 2023 23andMe breach, however, was the first time hackers had offered the data for sale. Last year, America's Federal Trade Commission took action against two direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies, CRI Genetics and 1Health/Vitagene, for failing to keep DNA data secure. Regardless of the motivation, any breach involving genetic data has potentially wide-ranging consequences. ""There is no way of knowing who has access to it now, how many people have access to it, or what they may choose to do with it in the future,"" Callow says. ""Genetic data does imply health outcomes in a lot of cases, and that is something that may affect a person's long-term employability or perhaps the likelihood of dying early or suffering a debilitating illness. Potentially, this data could be of interest to employers or insurers."" In an age where an increasing number of financial decisions are made by algorithms that scrape all possible sources of information about an individual, there is a serious possibility of financial loss and discrimination arising from a leak of genetic data. Health insurance companies in the US are barred from using genetic information to calculate risk, but there is no federal law to prohibit its use by life insurance companies. It's easy to imagine a scenario where leaked genetic data might lead to higher premiums or customers being denied cover entirely because of their genes, or being rejected for a long-term bank loan or mortgage because leaked data suggests a higher likelihood of the lender developing Alzheimer's and passing away before it could be was repaid in full. 23andMe has said the data breach of its user profiles did not include the leaking of raw DNA profiles, but the hacker still had access to ancestry reports that gave ethnicity estimates, geographical location, links to family trees and other personal information.  ""Any time our personal information is scraped, leaked, hacked, and enters the criminal ecosystem, it fuels identity theft,"" says Newman. ""Even broad information, geographic information, regional information or things about ethnicity can fuel the customisation of scams to try to trick you."" 23andMe now faces several class action lawsuits in the US as a consequence of the data breach. In January, the company admitted that hackers began infiltrating its customers' accounts in April 2023, and were able to continue for five months without detection. ""Protecting our customers' data privacy and security remains a top priority for 23andMe, and we will continue to invest in protecting our systems and data,"" the company says. It now requires two-step verification for all customers to access their accounts, and so do its competitors, Ancestry and MyHeritage. None of these companies required it before October 2023. But researchers have also recently identified other ways in which it might be possible to gather genetic information about people held by consumer genetic services. One paper by scientists at the University of California, Davis, demonstrated it was possible to reconstruct parts of a person's genome if an ""adversary"" was to uploading multiple falsified genomes to identify matches with ""relatives"". Even if it were possible to keep data as sensitive as our genetic code safe from hackers, there is no guarantee that once we have consented to share it with a corporation it will remain in their possession. ""These companies could be bought – the information could be acquired in that way,"" says Callow. In December 2020, New York investment firm Blackstone bought Ancestry , one of 23andMe's biggest competitors, for $4.7bn (£3.7bn). ""Beyond the data, these companies really have very little value,"" adds Callow. ""They are entirely data driven. Genetic details can now be sold, traded, acquired, along with other corporate intellectual property and assets. The DNA has value, and that value belongs to the company, not to you."" Blackstone declined an offer to comment when contacted by the BBC. While the idea of my genes now existing as a corporate asset is somewhat unnerving, I knew what I might be letting myself in for before I sent my DNA to Ancestry and 23andMe. None of the people I spoke to for my BBC series regretted taking an at-home DNA test : the knowledge of who their genes say they are and how they are connected to the world was life changing, and worth any potential risk. Even if you haven't taken one of these tests, it's likely that you have a close relative who has, and a very close version of your genetic code may exist in a corporate database . Your genes may already be out there, in some form. Who knows where they could end up? * Hacked, a special bonus episode of The Gift, is available on BBC Sounds now, along with the rest of the series.

76,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68225707,How can you keep children safe online and what parental controls are there?,"The question of how to keep children safe online is never far from parents' minds, but has come into increasing focus following the murder of 16-year-old Brianna Ghey. Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, who killed Brianna when they were 15, plotted the murder using messaging apps. Jenkinson had watched videos of violence and torture on the dark web. Brianna's mother, Esther, says the government should make it harder for young people to access potentially harmful material online. But what steps can parents take now to make their children's digital lives as safe as possible? Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, research by the communications regulator Ofcom suggests . Time spent online increases with age. Nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok. Four in five teenagers who go online say they have used AI tools such as ChatGPT or Snapchat's MyAI. About half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health , according to Ofcom. But there is a significant minority for whom that is not the case. One in eight children aged eight to 17 said someone had been nasty or hurtful to them on social media, or messaging apps. The Children's Commissioner said half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing ""hardcore, misogynistic"" pornographic material on social media sites. Parents concerned about what their children are seeing online can take some simple practical steps. The most obvious is to learn about control functions, which two-thirds of parents say they use, according to Internet Matters, a safety organisation set up by some of the big UK-based internet companies. It has a list of parental controls available and step-by-step guides on how to use them. The way these work varies. However, those available with YouTube - the most popular platform for young people in the UK - are a good indication of the kinds of tools available. Parents who want to reduce the likelihood of their children seeing unsuitable material can set them up with the ""kids"" version of YouTube, which filters out adult content. Or, if their children are older and want to use the main site, adults can make their accounts supervised. This means they are able to review what sites they have visited. Supervision can also be set up on Facebook messenger, via its Family Centre . And TikTok says its family pairing tool enables parents to decide if a teenager's account is private or public. Of course, these controls are not fool-proof. Some adults find setting them up confusing, and some children find ways of getting round them. Ofcom data suggests about one in 20 children use workarounds. Phone networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18. Some also have parental controls that can limit the websites children can visit on their phones. Android and Apple phones and tablets have apps and systems parents can use. These can block or limit access to specific apps, restrict explicit content, prevent purchases and monitor browsing. Apple has Screen Time and Google has Family Link . There are similar apps available from third-party developers. Broadband services also have parental controls to filter certain types of content. So do games consoles - allowing parents to ensure age-appropriate gaming and control in-game purchases. Talking to children about online safety and being interested in what they do online is also important , charities including the NSPCC say. Making discussions about it part of daily conversation, just like a chat about their day at school, can make children comfortable with the topic. It can also make children more likely to share any concerns they have. The government says its new law, the Online Safety Act , will force social media firms and search engines to do more to protect users, particularly children. It seeks to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms. However, the new legislation will take some time before it is fully enforced. And there have been recent calls for more to be done. Esther Ghey says the Online Safety Act does not go far enough and children must be stopped from having access to social media apps . She also wants parents to be able to download software to alert them to worrying content their children might be searching for. Conservative MP Miriam Cates has called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to consider banning under 16s from social media and smartphones. However Mr Sunak has said that the Online Safety Act ""protects children from harmful or inappropriate"" material.",9 February 2024,tech
77,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57764601,How do interest rates affect me?,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the fifth time in a row at its last meeting, but cuts are expected later in the year. Interest rates move up and down in order to control UK inflation, which has come down sharply in recent months, easing cost-of-living pressures. However, the UK economy has been stagnating amid increased borrowing costs and other pressures. Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The Bank of England's base rate, currently 5.25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This has a knock-on effect on what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest they pay on savings. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide what the base rate should be. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising across the economy as a whole . When inflation is going up, the Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less . The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. Mortgages Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey . When interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. About three-quarters of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. Their monthly payments aren't immediately affected when the Bank changes rates, but future deals are. Mortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. This means homebuyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a few years ago. About 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance. You can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator: Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders could decide to put their rates up, if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England, but if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. Individual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers. There are some good deals on the market, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest. The UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face ""robust action"" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers . The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years. However, the rate was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was running at 17% in November 1979 . There have been plenty of questions about why interest rates have not yet been cut, with the rate of inflation dropping sharply. Inflation was running at 3.2% in March . While that was down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, it is still above the Bank's 2% target. However, further falls are expected in the rate in the coming months. Governor Andrew Bailey has said that he had seen ""further encouraging signs"" that inflation was coming down. But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that it would fall back to its target and stay there. ""We're not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction,"" Mr Bailey added. The Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth - by keeping rates high. Interest rates have also been increasing across the world. However, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises. The UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies.",22 hours ago,business

79,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68763233,Volkswagen: Can the United Autoworkers Union win in the American south?,"Yolanda Peoples has tried for more than a decade to convince her co-workers at Volkswagen's factory in the southern state of Tennessee that joining the United Autoworkers Union (UAW) would pay off in increased job security, higher wages and a more comfortable retirement. Colleagues in Chattanooga have twice rejected the idea. Now, as her factory faces another vote on the question, this daughter and granddaughter of UAW members thinks she might finally have made her case. ""The whole atmosphere feels different,"" she said. ""They understand more about what we're fighting for."" The election, which involves roughly 4,300 workers and starts on 17 April, is the first to emerge from a campaign UAW leaders announced last year to try to win new members at 13 foreign-owned car factories based in the south. The share of workers represented by unions has fallen steadily in the US since the 1980s. But the pandemic ushered in an unusually hot jobs market and rapid rise in living costs, emboldening workers across the country to make demands. The number of mass strikes and petitions from workers hoping to join unions jumped in 2022 and 2023, drawing in Hollywood actors, UPS delivery drivers, Starbucks baristas, nurses, casino workers and others. Since 2021, there has even been a small uptick in the number of union members. At the top of both political parties, President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump have paid close attention to the signs of worker discontent, abandoning the free-trade orthodoxy that dominated both US political parties for decades in favour of protectionist economic policies long championed by organised labour. ""More people are demanding better pay, a piece of the action and a lot of this is a post-Covid thing,"" says Kent Syler, professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University. ""Is it enough in a very red state like Tennessee to move the needle? It's hard to say."" Prior efforts to unionise in Chattanooga and elsewhere in the south have failed in the face of fierce criticism from local politicians, Republicans, who warned a vote for the union could threaten government support for Volkswagen and make the state less appealing for business investment. The UAW's ties to the Democratic Party remain a liability on the factory floor, especially in an election year. Jeff Irvin Jr, who has worked at the Chattanooga plant since 2010, says he has supported the union in the past, but is on the fence this time. He says the UAW's recent endorsement of Mr Biden has given him pause. ""It's hard to back an organisation that backs a president that is failing the American people on almost every level,"" he wrote in an email to the BBC. The UAW, which has seen its sway fall as its membership and slice of the industry shrank, declared its ambitions last year weeks after a headline-drawing strike won big pay raises and other benefits for members at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Those gains helped re-ignite interest, says Jeremy Kimbrell, who has tried, and failed, to drum up union support repeatedly over his two decades working for Mercedes in Alabama. He noted that soon after, many rival carmakers, including Volkswagen, Mercedes and Nissan, announced big wage increases of their own. ""Some of the veteran workers saw it as like a slap in the face - as they could have given it to us all along,"" Mr Kimbrell said. ""With that big jump [the UAW] got this time, it was just abundantly clear that that was a better way."" A victory for the union would set factory workers up to pay UAW dues and negotiate collectively with companies over wages and benefits. Analysts say it could also convince other factories to follow suit. As well as Chattanooga, the union is expecting an election at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Vance, Alabama next month. It has also claimed significant progress signing up supporters for elections at Hyundai and Toyota. Campaigners say they are trying to steer clear of national politics and remain hopeful that shifting attitudes towards organised labour will finally give their cause a shot. ""It feels way different,"" said Volkswagen worker Zachary Costello, one of the union's vocal supporters at the Chattanooga factory. ""There's a lot more open acceptance of unionising across the shifts."" American University professor Stephen Silvia, who has written a book about prior UAW campaigns in the south, says the organisation has its ""best chance"" yet of victory, after refreshing its reputation and approach with new leadership. He says policies introduced by Trump and Biden to protect US car jobs have also strengthened the union's ability to demand more for workers without stoking fears the demands will hurt companies and backfire in the long run. Volkswagen declined to answer questions about next steps should the UAW win but said in a statement that it ""fully"" supported a vote and was ""proud"" of its record in Chattanooga - where the average annual salary is more than $60,000. At firms such as Starbucks and Amazon, union election victories have been bogged down as companies appeal the outcome or slow-walk contract negotiations. Volkswagen worker Jose Sandy says there is still ""a lot of scepticism"" about the UAW and its ability to make a difference. The union need ""to deliver on what they have have said they're going to do and it's not clear to me yet how they're going to do it,"" says Mr Sandy, who has been digging into Volkswagen's financial statements, concerned the union's claims about the company are misleading. Still, he says he is keeping an open mind and leaning toward a yes vote: ""I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.""",1 day ago,business

In February the German sportswear giant said it planned to sell its remaining Yeezy trainers from its partnership with West for at least cost price. Tuesday's upbeat comments from Adidas come a month after the company posted its first losses in 30 years. It makes Samba, Gazelle and Campus shoes. The company said the revised figures were €200m more than initially predicted and down to a better than expected first quarter of the year. The company said its quarterly operating profit had reached €336m, up from €60m a year earlier when it was hit by the break-up with West. Adidas further said it had sold another €150m worth of Yeezy products in the quarter, at a profit of around €50m. It said the remainder of its Yeezy stock would probably be sold for about €200m later this year, but without any further profit. Last year it pledged to donate some of the proceeds of the sales to charities who work on combating hate. Adidas cut ties with West in November 2022 over antisemitic comments he made on social media, but the company still has a diverse fan base with rich and powerful clients. Last week Adidas and its Samba brand were thrust into the headlines after it emerged British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had been one of its customers for ""many, many years"". Conscious that his serious reputation might not be to other Samba wearers' liking, Mr Sunak issued a ""fulsome"" apology on LBC radio but said he was a ""long-time devotee"" to the Adidas brand. But while the global firm has warned its profits will be dented by the Yeezy affair it has also drawn attention to the devaluation of the Argentine peso at the end of 2023. Adidas has been the maker of shirts for Argentina's national football team for decades. Rival sportswear firm Puma has also said Argentina's currency devaluation hit its financial results as the region was its biggest and fastest-growing market.",1 day ago,business
81,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68792637,Ex-Post Office boss regrets 'missed opportunity' to halt Horizon scandal,"A former Post Office executive has said he regrets a ""missed opportunity"" to halt the Horizon scandal in 2004. David Miller, a former Post Office chief operations officer, told the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal he regretted not reading a report compiled by an IT expert. The report found the IT system was ""clearly defective"". Mr Miller said had he read the report, he could have ""taken action to address the issues raised"". ""Knowing what I now know about Horizon and the way it was used to wrongly prosecute and bring civil claims against sub-postmasters, I very much regret not reading the expert's report and counsel's advice,"" he told the inquiry. ""Had I done so I would have taken action to address the issues raised. I acknowledge that by not reading them there was a missed opportunity,"" the former Post Office executive added. But during heated exchanges, Sam Stein, a lawyer representing some of the victims of the scandal, said Mr Miller was ""either lying"" about not having read the report, or ""a complete incompetent"". Mr Miller responded: ""I'm not lying through my teeth."" Mr Stein continued: ""Right, so incompetence?"" Mr Miller said: ""If you wish to say that, yes."" Mr Stein then asked: ""Well do you agree it's incompetence not to have read a report in these circumstances?"" Mr Miller replied: ""I'm not happy that I didn't read that report."" The report in question was written by IT consultant Jason Coyne who was commissioned by the Post Office as an expert witness for a civil case that the Post Office brought against sub-postmistress Julie Wolstenholme, who ran a branch in Cleveleys, Lancashire. The Post Office pursued her for £25,000 and as part of the case, instructed Mr Coyne to assess whether she was responsible for the losses. When he flagged discrepancies in the software, he was ""effectively sacked"" and the Post Office ""attempted to discredit the report internally"", according to Mr Coyne . The Post Office eventually settled the case. Mr Miller added that had Ms Wolstenholme won a tribunal appeal against the Post Office in 2002 for unfair dismissal it would have been a ""significant challenge to the business model"" of the Post Office. A Post Office ""IT risk register"" suggested it could suffer £1m of financial and reputational damage if it lost the case against Ms Wolstenholme, relating to reliability of Horizon accounting data. Later, the inquiry heard from former chief executive David Mills, who said he did not look any closer at the report. ""I hadn't properly assimilated the fact that the reliability of Horizon was in mind. What was in my mind was £1m,"" he said. ""If I had concentrated on any issue at that level, I'd have never gotten anywhere near to turning the Post Office [finances] around,"" he added. Mr Miller, who prior to promotion was in charge of getting the Horizon system up and running, earlier told the inquiry he should not have told the Post Office board the system was ""robust"" in 1999. He was recorded as saying the system was ""fit for purpose"" at a board meeting in July 1999 after testing. However, Mr Miller admitted he was aware that sub-postmasters were having problems with it a month before. For more than 15 years from 1999, the Post Office insisted Horizon was robust when prosecuting sub-postmasters. But many were having difficulty balancing accounts during a live trial of the system in May 1999. Mr Miller was also aware of other problems with the system that had occurred during testing that March. And in August of that year, auditors EY flagged concerns with ""accounting integrity issues"" during a live trial of Horizon to Mr Miller. He had previously told an inquiry into the Horizon scandal that he would not have told the board in 1999 that the system was robust. But giving fresh evidence to the inquiry on Tuesday, he said that although he did not recall telling the board that, if it was noted in the minutes then he must have done. ""I should not have said that it was robust,"" he said. However, he said he had believed there were processes in place to improve the system after feedback from sub-postmasters. Mr Miller was in charge of putting the Horizon system in place from 1998 until early 2000. After that, he rose up the ranks to become chief operations officer. Mr Miller also said he regretted not letting the head of the Post Office investigations team, Tony Marsh, and group lawyers know about problems with inaccuracies in the system which were still being addressed in early 2000. ""On reflection, and I have reflected on this very hard, when I finished being the Horizon programme director [in early 2000] it would have been very beneficial if I had notified both the lawyers and the [investigations team] that Horizon was a new system coming in, and that they should be very cautious about evidence coming out of that system,"" he said. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted more than 700 sub-postmasters using faulty data from the Horizon system, and more than 900 were prosecuted over all. Mr Miller said that he had been aware since 1970 that the Post Office performed its own investigations and prosecutions. He said he now recognised that there was a problem in the Post Office being the alleged victim of financial crime by sub-postmasters, as well as the investigator of those alleged crimes, and the prosecutor - although he did not think there was a conflict of interest at the time.",2 days ago,business
82,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68823399,Russia to grow faster than all advanced economies says IMF,"An influential global body has forecast Russia's economy will grow faster than all of the world's advanced economies, including the US, this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Russia to grow 3.2% this year, significantly more than the UK, France and Germany. Oil exports have ""held steady"" and government spending has ""remained high"" contributing to growth, the IMF said. Overall, it said the world economy had been ""remarkably resilient"" ""Despite many gloomy predictions, the world avoided a recession, the banking system proved largely resilient, and major emerging market economies did not suffer sudden stops,"" the IMF said. The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They are used by businesses to help plan where to invest, and by central banks, such as the Bank of England to guide its decisions on interest rates. The group says that the forecasts it makes for growth the following year in most advanced economies, more often than not, have been within about 1.5 percentage points of what actually happens. Despite the Kremlin being sanctioned over its invasion of Ukraine, the IMF upgraded its January predictions for the Russian economy this year, and said while growth would be lower in 2025, it would be still be higher than previously expected at 1.8%. Investments from corporate and state owned enterprises and ""robustness in private consumption"" within Russia had promoted growth alongside strong exports of oil, according to Petya Koeva Brooks, deputy director at the IMF. Russia is one of the world's biggest oil exporters and in February, the BBC revealed millions of barrels of fuel made from Russian oil were still being imported to the UK despite sanctions. Away from Russia, the IMF downgraded its forecasts across Europe and for the UK this year, predicting 0.5% growth this year, making the UK the second weakest performer across the G7 group of advanced economies, behind Germany. The G7 also includes France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US. Growth is set to improve to 1.5% in 2025, putting the UK among the top three best performers in the G7, according to the IMF. However, the IMF said that interest rates in the UK will remain higher than other advanced nations, close to 4% until 2029. The group expects the UK to have the highest inflation of any G7 economy in 2023 and 2024. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the IMF's figures showed that the UK economy was turning a corner. ""Inflation in 2024 is predicted to be 1.2% lower than before, and over the next six years we are projected to grow faster than large European economies such as Germany or France - both of which have had significantly larger downgrades to short-term growth than the UK,"" he said. Economists at the IMF warned that if the Israel-Hamas conflict escalates further in the Middle East it could lead to rising food and energy prices around the world. Continued attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the ongoing war in Ukraine could also affect the so far ""remarkably resilient"" global economy, it said. A potential spike in food, energy and transport costs would see lower-income countries hardest hit, it added.",2 days ago,business
83,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52660591,Unemployment: Who are the millions of Britons not working?,"About a quarter of people of working-age - nearly 11 million people - do not currently have jobs. In his Budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt set out a series of measures designed to encourage people to find work, or increase their hours. Officially, just over 4% of people are unemployed - about 1.4 million people in the UK . While there has been a slight uptick in recent months, unemployment is still relatively low historically. But the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people (aged 16-64) who are not in a paid job. About nine million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Instead these people are called ""economically inactive"" . In fact, more of them say they want a job (1.7 million people) than are officially unemployed (1.4 million). It varies according to age. Most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" people under 25 are students, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The majority of them do not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Things are different in other age groups. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s are out of the job market are illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who has retired early says they want to return to work. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people do not work because of caring responsibilities (about a million of whom are women). Nearly one million people in this age group are not working because of illness (more evenly split between men and women). Around half of people with disabilities do not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working age population. Less than a quarter of those who are sick or caring say they want a job. Many people have chosen to do something else: studying, retirement or caring. But for others it is not a choice. Some people cannot afford childcare if they return to work, others are too sick, or have given up on finding a job. As the chart below shows, sickness and caring responsibilities are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who actually would like a paid job. The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means less tax to pay for services like the NHS, and greater spending on benefits . Since people on benefits generally have less money to spend than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses and how many people they want to employ. In turn, that can affect how many jobs are available for those who are job hunting. The UK's 'inactivity' rate is back up to the levels seen in 2015. That is low by historical standards, as each decade more and more women have been joining the workforce. But the recent trend is unusual. During the pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while the other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than in 2019 - by over 1% of the working-age population. Before the pandemic, the UK's inactivity rate was second lowest in the G7 club of leading advanced economies, with only Japan's lower. The increase in inactivity shown above now puts the UK fourth out of seven, overtaking Germany and Canada but still below the US, France and Italy. The Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that the drop since the pandemic that distinguishes the UK is due to ill-health being consistently ""a bigger factor"" on the island than in the other advanced economies. A series of reforms were announced in the Budget to help some people get jobs or increase the hours they work. The measures were particularly aimed at: These include cutting the rate for national insurance contributions, extending free childcare to ensure single-earner households aren't disadvantaged, and offering more support to help disabled people find paid employment. Broadening the pool of people given support to return to the job market is key, experts argue. Stephen Evans from the Learning and Work Institute believes the government needs to widen employment support and invest in social infrastructure, such as childcare, skills and health.

84,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240409-aziz-koleilat-ge-aerospace-bbc-interview,How GE Aerospace's cross-cultural team cracks the biggest problems,"Aziz Koleilat, GE Aerospace's vice president of sales and marketing and general manager, enters the BBC's Executive Lounge to talk about how international perspectives drive innovation. Business no longer happens in a vacuum. In a globalised environment that's only becoming more interconnected, leaders need to have a cross-cultural perspective to take the right decisions. Aziz Koleilat knows that. Born in Prague and raised in Lebanon, Koleilat went to university to study biomedical engineering in the US, then earned his MBA in Canada. Now at GE Aerospace, he serves as the vice president of sales and marketing and general manager for the Middle East, Turkey, Eastern Europe and Russia/CIS – and is tasked to draw on his global experience to build teams committed to expanding GE's footprint in this critically important region. ""Creating diversity of thought and experience in a team is critical,"" Koleilat tells the BBC. ""Diverse teams must allow for the free exchange of ideas. All the deals that GE has made here in the Middle East come from a collaborative environment."" The work he's done has made its mark: three out of every four commercial flights globally are powered by a GE Aerospace or GE partner engine on airlines including Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines. Now, Koleilat is taking on an even more urgent challenge: tackling sustainability in aeronautics with the use of alternative fuels. Although the problem may be different, however, his strategy remains the same: creating an inclusive, innovative working environment that encourages big and small ideas alike – and shapes future voices of global business. ""It's fascinating to watch how people grow. I like to help them grow and thrive and then I move on, and I open the space for them to become leaders, he says. ""It's a simple formula for success."" Koletiat talks to the BBC about the critical role of diverse cultural perspectives, and the pleasure of seeing your team grow. At GE, you've worked across so much of the business. What have you learned along the way as you've collected cross-sector experience? When I got to GE, I started out in healthcare, then power and eventually to aerospace. Having had the opportunity to work within multiple businesses, and move to new countries, I am sensitive to the dynamics of new teams, new regions and new cultural dynamics. We have a tendency as business leaders to come into a new situation and immediately focus on the product: create the product, then go to market. Having made significant moves across sectors and regions, I think that can be short-sighted. I believe it's important to take the time to learn the unique elements of each unique market. If you are able to develop a deep understanding of your market, you will have greater insight into the product and how you can make it fit the needs of the consumer. On a personal level, I think that movement is important for career growth. In every sector I've been involved in, I've learned it's important to understand when you've reached a level where it's OK for somebody else to come and take over. At some point, everybody will reach a plateau where you are not learning anything new or different. That's when somebody new must take the team to another level. I'm proud that many of the healthcare people that used to work with me and reported to me took over my job when I moved on. For me, movement is very much about getting to the next challenge and giving others the chance to grow. You've overseen some big changes in the aviation industry, including the widespread use of sustainable aviation fuels. What do the solutions of the future look like, and how are you getting there? We're working on so much: electric, hydrogen, open fan and lots of different technologies. You're never working on just one thing – you have to do multiple things at the same time. You have to create efficiency, you have to streamline and perfect technology. Right now, we are very invested in alternative fuels, but we are also looking to other solutions for the future – something the team here is fully engaged with. One of the challenges in this region specifically is something called the ""hot and harsh"" environment: there's lots of sand here. And very simply, what happens is, as the sand gets into the engine, it sticks to the fans, and reduces the efficiency of the aircraft. Hence, your fuel usage goes up. In most places, they are washed with water, but here, the minerals get stuck to sand. So, we developed a rinse that will actually get the engines in this region clean. And that seemingly small thing will be a huge improvement for the environment. More from Executive Lounge: For this kind of small-but-important innovation, we have to have a team that's committed, and has the space to drive the direction of technology and the resources to do it. That's the critical part that I go back to every time I talk about diversity: we have to encourage experimentation and open dialogue from everyone on the team to innovate. The legacy GE has recently transformed into three industry specialised, independent companies. What can niche businesses do that larger conglomerates can't? The most important point is to really to focus on our specialties, and we've fully focused on aerospace. Within that sector we are focusing on the future of developing technologies. So, this is quite an undertaking. For example, investing sustainability in healthcare is different from investing in technology for aerospace. The key point is for each sector to have the space to create their own technology. I think at this point because of the legacy that GE has in the aerospace industry and the technology we have, there is a bright future going forward. It's necessary to be really focused on that future. Second, we have a real opportunity as a leaner organisation to try new things, take on new challenges. And it doesn't have to be moving vertically to be moving bigger. What ever gets you curious is something you should take on and try because that will build new experience. For me, it's still about the team. My biggest pleasure is seeing the teams that I've worked with grow and really develop further. You've mentioned the importance of collaboration quite a few times. What do you think is most important about teamwork? Most importantly, we need to make sure that we have diverse voices on our teams. If you understand the market, you understand the product, the last step is creating a diverse team and giving them the space to share ideas and solve problems together by utilising their own diverse backgrounds and expertise and valuing those things in their team members. Companies are learning the value of diversity in all aspects of their business. And then, very importantly, all teams need a space where they aren't afraid to tackle difficult things that might not work out. There should be a safe space for all your employees to be able to tell you if things aren't going in the right direction. We need to have transparency of information – especially in a highly volatile environment, there are lots of stakeholders and differences of opinion. I really believe in fuelling the mindset of solving problems together as an organisation, of being committed to that purpose. And so I look at it from all different angles: putting a team together, and then giving them the self-confidence to voice their opinion and grow their careers. In my career, I've been very lucky to work with very, very smart people that have gone on to pursue something bigger than me, and I want to continue that momentum.

85,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57764601,How do interest rates affect me?,"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the fifth time in a row at its last meeting, but cuts are expected later in the year. Interest rates move up and down in order to control UK inflation, which has come down sharply in recent months, easing cost-of-living pressures. However, the UK economy has been stagnating amid increased borrowing costs and other pressures. Interest rates set by the Bank of England affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The Bank of England's base rate, currently 5.25%, is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This has a knock-on effect on what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest they pay on savings. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide what the base rate should be. It has a target to keep UK inflation at 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising across the economy as a whole . When inflation is going up, the Bank may decide to raise rates to encourage people to spend less . The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. Mortgages Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey . When interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. About three-quarters of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. Their monthly payments aren't immediately affected when the Bank changes rates, but future deals are. Mortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. This means homebuyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a few years ago. About 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance. You can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator: Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders could decide to put their rates up, if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England, but if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. Individual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers. There are some good deals on the market, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest. The UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face ""robust action"" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers . The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years. However, the rate was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was running at 17% in November 1979 . There have been plenty of questions about why interest rates have not yet been cut, with the rate of inflation dropping sharply. Inflation was running at 3.2% in March . While that was down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, it is still above the Bank's 2% target. However, further falls are expected in the rate in the coming months. Governor Andrew Bailey has said that he had seen ""further encouraging signs"" that inflation was coming down. But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that it would fall back to its target and stay there. ""We're not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction,"" Mr Bailey added. The Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth - by keeping rates high. Interest rates have also been increasing across the world. However, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises. The UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies.",22 hours ago,business

The election, which involves roughly 4,300 workers and starts on 17 April, is the first to emerge from a campaign UAW leaders announced last year to try to win new members at 13 foreign-owned car factories based in the south. The share of workers represented by unions has fallen steadily in the US since the 1980s. But the pandemic ushered in an unusually hot jobs market and rapid rise in living costs, emboldening workers across the country to make demands. The number of mass strikes and petitions from workers hoping to join unions jumped in 2022 and 2023, drawing in Hollywood actors, UPS delivery drivers, Starbucks baristas, nurses, casino workers and others. Since 2021, there has even been a small uptick in the number of union members. At the top of both political parties, President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump have paid close attention to the signs of worker discontent, abandoning the free-trade orthodoxy that dominated both US political parties for decades in favour of protectionist economic policies long championed by organised labour. ""More people are demanding better pay, a piece of the action and a lot of this is a post-Covid thing,"" says Kent Syler, professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University. ""Is it enough in a very red state like Tennessee to move the needle? It's hard to say."" Prior efforts to unionise in Chattanooga and elsewhere in the south have failed in the face of fierce criticism from local politicians, Republicans, who warned a vote for the union could threaten government support for Volkswagen and make the state less appealing for business investment. The UAW's ties to the Democratic Party remain a liability on the factory floor, especially in an election year. Jeff Irvin Jr, who has worked at the Chattanooga plant since 2010, says he has supported the union in the past, but is on the fence this time. He says the UAW's recent endorsement of Mr Biden has given him pause. ""It's hard to back an organisation that backs a president that is failing the American people on almost every level,"" he wrote in an email to the BBC. The UAW, which has seen its sway fall as its membership and slice of the industry shrank, declared its ambitions last year weeks after a headline-drawing strike won big pay raises and other benefits for members at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Those gains helped re-ignite interest, says Jeremy Kimbrell, who has tried, and failed, to drum up union support repeatedly over his two decades working for Mercedes in Alabama. He noted that soon after, many rival carmakers, including Volkswagen, Mercedes and Nissan, announced big wage increases of their own. ""Some of the veteran workers saw it as like a slap in the face - as they could have given it to us all along,"" Mr Kimbrell said. ""With that big jump [the UAW] got this time, it was just abundantly clear that that was a better way."" A victory for the union would set factory workers up to pay UAW dues and negotiate collectively with companies over wages and benefits. Analysts say it could also convince other factories to follow suit. As well as Chattanooga, the union is expecting an election at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Vance, Alabama next month. It has also claimed significant progress signing up supporters for elections at Hyundai and Toyota. Campaigners say they are trying to steer clear of national politics and remain hopeful that shifting attitudes towards organised labour will finally give their cause a shot. ""It feels way different,"" said Volkswagen worker Zachary Costello, one of the union's vocal supporters at the Chattanooga factory. ""There's a lot more open acceptance of unionising across the shifts."" American University professor Stephen Silvia, who has written a book about prior UAW campaigns in the south, says the organisation has its ""best chance"" yet of victory, after refreshing its reputation and approach with new leadership. He says policies introduced by Trump and Biden to protect US car jobs have also strengthened the union's ability to demand more for workers without stoking fears the demands will hurt companies and backfire in the long run. Volkswagen declined to answer questions about next steps should the UAW win but said in a statement that it ""fully"" supported a vote and was ""proud"" of its record in Chattanooga - where the average annual salary is more than $60,000. At firms such as Starbucks and Amazon, union election victories have been bogged down as companies appeal the outcome or slow-walk contract negotiations. Volkswagen worker Jose Sandy says there is still ""a lot of scepticism"" about the UAW and its ability to make a difference. The union need ""to deliver on what they have have said they're going to do and it's not clear to me yet how they're going to do it,"" says Mr Sandy, who has been digging into Volkswagen's financial statements, concerned the union's claims about the company are misleading. Still, he says he is keeping an open mind and leaning toward a yes vote: ""I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.""",1 day ago,business

In February the German sportswear giant said it planned to sell its remaining Yeezy trainers from its partnership with West for at least cost price. Tuesday's upbeat comments from Adidas come a month after the company posted its first losses in 30 years. It makes Samba, Gazelle and Campus shoes. The company said the revised figures were €200m more than initially predicted and down to a better than expected first quarter of the year. The company said its quarterly operating profit had reached €336m, up from €60m a year earlier when it was hit by the break-up with West. Adidas further said it had sold another €150m worth of Yeezy products in the quarter, at a profit of around €50m. It said the remainder of its Yeezy stock would probably be sold for about €200m later this year, but without any further profit. Last year it pledged to donate some of the proceeds of the sales to charities who work on combating hate. Adidas cut ties with West in November 2022 over antisemitic comments he made on social media, but the company still has a diverse fan base with rich and powerful clients. Last week Adidas and its Samba brand were thrust into the headlines after it emerged British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had been one of its customers for ""many, many years"". Conscious that his serious reputation might not be to other Samba wearers' liking, Mr Sunak issued a ""fulsome"" apology on LBC radio but said he was a ""long-time devotee"" to the Adidas brand. But while the global firm has warned its profits will be dented by the Yeezy affair it has also drawn attention to the devaluation of the Argentine peso at the end of 2023. Adidas has been the maker of shirts for Argentina's national football team for decades. Rival sportswear firm Puma has also said Argentina's currency devaluation hit its financial results as the region was its biggest and fastest-growing market.",1 day ago,business
89,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68792637,Ex-Post Office boss regrets 'missed opportunity' to halt Horizon scandal,"A former Post Office executive has said he regrets a ""missed opportunity"" to halt the Horizon scandal in 2004. David Miller, a former Post Office chief operations officer, told the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal he regretted not reading a report compiled by an IT expert. The report found the IT system was ""clearly defective"". Mr Miller said had he read the report, he could have ""taken action to address the issues raised"". ""Knowing what I now know about Horizon and the way it was used to wrongly prosecute and bring civil claims against sub-postmasters, I very much regret not reading the expert's report and counsel's advice,"" he told the inquiry. ""Had I done so I would have taken action to address the issues raised. I acknowledge that by not reading them there was a missed opportunity,"" the former Post Office executive added. But during heated exchanges, Sam Stein, a lawyer representing some of the victims of the scandal, said Mr Miller was ""either lying"" about not having read the report, or ""a complete incompetent"". Mr Miller responded: ""I'm not lying through my teeth."" Mr Stein continued: ""Right, so incompetence?"" Mr Miller said: ""If you wish to say that, yes."" Mr Stein then asked: ""Well do you agree it's incompetence not to have read a report in these circumstances?"" Mr Miller replied: ""I'm not happy that I didn't read that report."" The report in question was written by IT consultant Jason Coyne who was commissioned by the Post Office as an expert witness for a civil case that the Post Office brought against sub-postmistress Julie Wolstenholme, who ran a branch in Cleveleys, Lancashire. The Post Office pursued her for £25,000 and as part of the case, instructed Mr Coyne to assess whether she was responsible for the losses. When he flagged discrepancies in the software, he was ""effectively sacked"" and the Post Office ""attempted to discredit the report internally"", according to Mr Coyne . The Post Office eventually settled the case. Mr Miller added that had Ms Wolstenholme won a tribunal appeal against the Post Office in 2002 for unfair dismissal it would have been a ""significant challenge to the business model"" of the Post Office. A Post Office ""IT risk register"" suggested it could suffer £1m of financial and reputational damage if it lost the case against Ms Wolstenholme, relating to reliability of Horizon accounting data. Later, the inquiry heard from former chief executive David Mills, who said he did not look any closer at the report. ""I hadn't properly assimilated the fact that the reliability of Horizon was in mind. What was in my mind was £1m,"" he said. ""If I had concentrated on any issue at that level, I'd have never gotten anywhere near to turning the Post Office [finances] around,"" he added. Mr Miller, who prior to promotion was in charge of getting the Horizon system up and running, earlier told the inquiry he should not have told the Post Office board the system was ""robust"" in 1999. He was recorded as saying the system was ""fit for purpose"" at a board meeting in July 1999 after testing. However, Mr Miller admitted he was aware that sub-postmasters were having problems with it a month before. For more than 15 years from 1999, the Post Office insisted Horizon was robust when prosecuting sub-postmasters. But many were having difficulty balancing accounts during a live trial of the system in May 1999. Mr Miller was also aware of other problems with the system that had occurred during testing that March. And in August of that year, auditors EY flagged concerns with ""accounting integrity issues"" during a live trial of Horizon to Mr Miller. He had previously told an inquiry into the Horizon scandal that he would not have told the board in 1999 that the system was robust. But giving fresh evidence to the inquiry on Tuesday, he said that although he did not recall telling the board that, if it was noted in the minutes then he must have done. ""I should not have said that it was robust,"" he said. However, he said he had believed there were processes in place to improve the system after feedback from sub-postmasters. Mr Miller was in charge of putting the Horizon system in place from 1998 until early 2000. After that, he rose up the ranks to become chief operations officer. Mr Miller also said he regretted not letting the head of the Post Office investigations team, Tony Marsh, and group lawyers know about problems with inaccuracies in the system which were still being addressed in early 2000. ""On reflection, and I have reflected on this very hard, when I finished being the Horizon programme director [in early 2000] it would have been very beneficial if I had notified both the lawyers and the [investigations team] that Horizon was a new system coming in, and that they should be very cautious about evidence coming out of that system,"" he said. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted more than 700 sub-postmasters using faulty data from the Horizon system, and more than 900 were prosecuted over all. Mr Miller said that he had been aware since 1970 that the Post Office performed its own investigations and prosecutions. He said he now recognised that there was a problem in the Post Office being the alleged victim of financial crime by sub-postmasters, as well as the investigator of those alleged crimes, and the prosecutor - although he did not think there was a conflict of interest at the time.",2 days ago,business
90,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68823399,Russia to grow faster than all advanced economies says IMF,"An influential global body has forecast Russia's economy will grow faster than all of the world's advanced economies, including the US, this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Russia to grow 3.2% this year, significantly more than the UK, France and Germany. Oil exports have ""held steady"" and government spending has ""remained high"" contributing to growth, the IMF said. Overall, it said the world economy had been ""remarkably resilient"" ""Despite many gloomy predictions, the world avoided a recession, the banking system proved largely resilient, and major emerging market economies did not suffer sudden stops,"" the IMF said. The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They are used by businesses to help plan where to invest, and by central banks, such as the Bank of England to guide its decisions on interest rates. The group says that the forecasts it makes for growth the following year in most advanced economies, more often than not, have been within about 1.5 percentage points of what actually happens. Despite the Kremlin being sanctioned over its invasion of Ukraine, the IMF upgraded its January predictions for the Russian economy this year, and said while growth would be lower in 2025, it would be still be higher than previously expected at 1.8%. Investments from corporate and state owned enterprises and ""robustness in private consumption"" within Russia had promoted growth alongside strong exports of oil, according to Petya Koeva Brooks, deputy director at the IMF. Russia is one of the world's biggest oil exporters and in February, the BBC revealed millions of barrels of fuel made from Russian oil were still being imported to the UK despite sanctions. Away from Russia, the IMF downgraded its forecasts across Europe and for the UK this year, predicting 0.5% growth this year, making the UK the second weakest performer across the G7 group of advanced economies, behind Germany. The G7 also includes France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US. Growth is set to improve to 1.5% in 2025, putting the UK among the top three best performers in the G7, according to the IMF. However, the IMF said that interest rates in the UK will remain higher than other advanced nations, close to 4% until 2029. The group expects the UK to have the highest inflation of any G7 economy in 2023 and 2024. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the IMF's figures showed that the UK economy was turning a corner. ""Inflation in 2024 is predicted to be 1.2% lower than before, and over the next six years we are projected to grow faster than large European economies such as Germany or France - both of which have had significantly larger downgrades to short-term growth than the UK,"" he said. Economists at the IMF warned that if the Israel-Hamas conflict escalates further in the Middle East it could lead to rising food and energy prices around the world. Continued attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the ongoing war in Ukraine could also affect the so far ""remarkably resilient"" global economy, it said. A potential spike in food, energy and transport costs would see lower-income countries hardest hit, it added.",2 days ago,business
91,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52660591,Unemployment: Who are the millions of Britons not working?,"About a quarter of people of working-age - nearly 11 million people - do not currently have jobs. In his Budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt set out a series of measures designed to encourage people to find work, or increase their hours. Officially, just over 4% of people are unemployed - about 1.4 million people in the UK . While there has been a slight uptick in recent months, unemployment is still relatively low historically. But the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people (aged 16-64) who are not in a paid job. About nine million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Instead these people are called ""economically inactive"" . In fact, more of them say they want a job (1.7 million people) than are officially unemployed (1.4 million). It varies according to age. Most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" people under 25 are students, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The majority of them do not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Things are different in other age groups. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s are out of the job market are illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who has retired early says they want to return to work. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people do not work because of caring responsibilities (about a million of whom are women). Nearly one million people in this age group are not working because of illness (more evenly split between men and women). Around half of people with disabilities do not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working age population. Less than a quarter of those who are sick or caring say they want a job. Many people have chosen to do something else: studying, retirement or caring. But for others it is not a choice. Some people cannot afford childcare if they return to work, others are too sick, or have given up on finding a job. As the chart below shows, sickness and caring responsibilities are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who actually would like a paid job. The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means less tax to pay for services like the NHS, and greater spending on benefits . Since people on benefits generally have less money to spend than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses and how many people they want to employ. In turn, that can affect how many jobs are available for those who are job hunting. The UK's 'inactivity' rate is back up to the levels seen in 2015. That is low by historical standards, as each decade more and more women have been joining the workforce. But the recent trend is unusual. During the pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while the other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than in 2019 - by over 1% of the working-age population. Before the pandemic, the UK's inactivity rate was second lowest in the G7 club of leading advanced economies, with only Japan's lower. The increase in inactivity shown above now puts the UK fourth out of seven, overtaking Germany and Canada but still below the US, France and Italy. The Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that the drop since the pandemic that distinguishes the UK is due to ill-health being consistently ""a bigger factor"" on the island than in the other advanced economies. A series of reforms were announced in the Budget to help some people get jobs or increase the hours they work. The measures were particularly aimed at: These include cutting the rate for national insurance contributions, extending free childcare to ensure single-earner households aren't disadvantaged, and offering more support to help disabled people find paid employment. Broadening the pool of people given support to return to the job market is key, experts argue. Stephen Evans from the Learning and Work Institute believes the government needs to widen employment support and invest in social infrastructure, such as childcare, skills and health.

92,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240409-aziz-koleilat-ge-aerospace-bbc-interview,How GE Aerospace's cross-cultural team cracks the biggest problems,"Aziz Koleilat, GE Aerospace's vice president of sales and marketing and general manager, enters the BBC's Executive Lounge to talk about how international perspectives drive innovation. Business no longer happens in a vacuum. In a globalised environment that's only becoming more interconnected, leaders need to have a cross-cultural perspective to take the right decisions. Aziz Koleilat knows that. Born in Prague and raised in Lebanon, Koleilat went to university to study biomedical engineering in the US, then earned his MBA in Canada. Now at GE Aerospace, he serves as the vice president of sales and marketing and general manager for the Middle East, Turkey, Eastern Europe and Russia/CIS – and is tasked to draw on his global experience to build teams committed to expanding GE's footprint in this critically important region. ""Creating diversity of thought and experience in a team is critical,"" Koleilat tells the BBC. ""Diverse teams must allow for the free exchange of ideas. All the deals that GE has made here in the Middle East come from a collaborative environment."" The work he's done has made its mark: three out of every four commercial flights globally are powered by a GE Aerospace or GE partner engine on airlines including Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines. Now, Koleilat is taking on an even more urgent challenge: tackling sustainability in aeronautics with the use of alternative fuels. Although the problem may be different, however, his strategy remains the same: creating an inclusive, innovative working environment that encourages big and small ideas alike – and shapes future voices of global business. ""It's fascinating to watch how people grow. I like to help them grow and thrive and then I move on, and I open the space for them to become leaders, he says. ""It's a simple formula for success."" Koletiat talks to the BBC about the critical role of diverse cultural perspectives, and the pleasure of seeing your team grow. At GE, you've worked across so much of the business. What have you learned along the way as you've collected cross-sector experience? When I got to GE, I started out in healthcare, then power and eventually to aerospace. Having had the opportunity to work within multiple businesses, and move to new countries, I am sensitive to the dynamics of new teams, new regions and new cultural dynamics. We have a tendency as business leaders to come into a new situation and immediately focus on the product: create the product, then go to market. Having made significant moves across sectors and regions, I think that can be short-sighted. I believe it's important to take the time to learn the unique elements of each unique market. If you are able to develop a deep understanding of your market, you will have greater insight into the product and how you can make it fit the needs of the consumer. On a personal level, I think that movement is important for career growth. In every sector I've been involved in, I've learned it's important to understand when you've reached a level where it's OK for somebody else to come and take over. At some point, everybody will reach a plateau where you are not learning anything new or different. That's when somebody new must take the team to another level. I'm proud that many of the healthcare people that used to work with me and reported to me took over my job when I moved on. For me, movement is very much about getting to the next challenge and giving others the chance to grow. You've overseen some big changes in the aviation industry, including the widespread use of sustainable aviation fuels. What do the solutions of the future look like, and how are you getting there? We're working on so much: electric, hydrogen, open fan and lots of different technologies. You're never working on just one thing – you have to do multiple things at the same time. You have to create efficiency, you have to streamline and perfect technology. Right now, we are very invested in alternative fuels, but we are also looking to other solutions for the future – something the team here is fully engaged with. One of the challenges in this region specifically is something called the ""hot and harsh"" environment: there's lots of sand here. And very simply, what happens is, as the sand gets into the engine, it sticks to the fans, and reduces the efficiency of the aircraft. Hence, your fuel usage goes up. In most places, they are washed with water, but here, the minerals get stuck to sand. So, we developed a rinse that will actually get the engines in this region clean. And that seemingly small thing will be a huge improvement for the environment. More from Executive Lounge: For this kind of small-but-important innovation, we have to have a team that's committed, and has the space to drive the direction of technology and the resources to do it. That's the critical part that I go back to every time I talk about diversity: we have to encourage experimentation and open dialogue from everyone on the team to innovate. The legacy GE has recently transformed into three industry specialised, independent companies. What can niche businesses do that larger conglomerates can't? The most important point is to really to focus on our specialties, and we've fully focused on aerospace. Within that sector we are focusing on the future of developing technologies. So, this is quite an undertaking. For example, investing sustainability in healthcare is different from investing in technology for aerospace. The key point is for each sector to have the space to create their own technology. I think at this point because of the legacy that GE has in the aerospace industry and the technology we have, there is a bright future going forward. It's necessary to be really focused on that future. Second, we have a real opportunity as a leaner organisation to try new things, take on new challenges. And it doesn't have to be moving vertically to be moving bigger. What ever gets you curious is something you should take on and try because that will build new experience. For me, it's still about the team. My biggest pleasure is seeing the teams that I've worked with grow and really develop further. You've mentioned the importance of collaboration quite a few times. What do you think is most important about teamwork? Most importantly, we need to make sure that we have diverse voices on our teams. If you understand the market, you understand the product, the last step is creating a diverse team and giving them the space to share ideas and solve problems together by utilising their own diverse backgrounds and expertise and valuing those things in their team members. Companies are learning the value of diversity in all aspects of their business. And then, very importantly, all teams need a space where they aren't afraid to tackle difficult things that might not work out. There should be a safe space for all your employees to be able to tell you if things aren't going in the right direction. We need to have transparency of information – especially in a highly volatile environment, there are lots of stakeholders and differences of opinion. I really believe in fuelling the mindset of solving problems together as an organisation, of being committed to that purpose. And so I look at it from all different angles: putting a team together, and then giving them the self-confidence to voice their opinion and grow their careers. In my career, I've been very lucky to work with very, very smart people that have gone on to pursue something bigger than me, and I want to continue that momentum.

Reigate and Banstead Borough Council rejected the proposals for 11 shared occupancy properties on the site in Merstham over the impact it would have on a shared-access road. A community football club and Age Concern centre both currently use Weldon Way for access. The council's planning committee heard that using the road for the proposed homes would have had too great an impact on the existing users and could lead to potential conflict with new home owners. The access road is also used as the emergency evacuation point for elderly people, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service . The former single-storey brick library building closed in 2017 when the branch was relocated to Merstham community hub. The proposed homes would have been in two pairs of semi-detached two-storey buildings, and two terrace rows - one with three dwellings and one with four. They would have been surrounded by a surgery, an Age Concern day centre and community hall, and Merstham recreation ground.

Julian Dunkerton's response came as the company launched a huge restructuring programme aimed at securing the British retailer's survival. Mr Dunkerton told the BBC that the clothing brand was a ""broad church"" appealing to different types of shoppers. However, on Tuesday the chain announced a range of cost-cutting measures, including delisting from the London Stock Exchange. The fashion business, which runs 216 shops as well as franchised stores, has been looking at various ways to save money after a year of weakening sales and deepening losses. Plans to cut costs include the firm looking at reducing rents on 39 of its UK shops, as well as raising money through a sale of new shares. Superdry said it would be forced to enter into administration if it did not go ahead with the plans. Mr Dunkerton, chief executive and co-founder, said the announcement marked a ""critical moment"" in the company's history. But in an interview with the BBC shortly after the announcement, he said he was ""confident"" the measures would see ""the future of the brand is secured"". The retailer, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham in 2003, was set up by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder, and went on to enjoy huge commercial success. Delisting from the London Stock Exchange will help Superdry save on cash and on Mr Dunkerton's time, the firm said on Tuesday. It added the move would also allow it to carry out its restructuring ""away from the heightened exposure of public markets"", although the business will need shareholders to approve its restructure plans at its next general meeting. It hopes to carry its proposals out by July 2024, according to a provisional timetable. But Peter Williams, former chairman of Superdry, suggested on the BBC's Today programme that the move was a reflection of a ""brand that is probably not as cool as it used to be"". ""That’s the problem - because teenagers don’t necessarily want to shop where their parents used to shop and there is this natural culling of fashion brands that goes on,"" he said. Mr Dunkerton, who previously resigned from the board before returning to ""steady the ship"" in 2019, hit back, saying: ""The reality is that the brand speaks to all human beings - it’s a very broad church and needs to be. ""While you go through the ebbs and flows of brand heat – actually having a diverse customer base is key,"" he added, citing the success of sportswear giant Nike as an example. Mr Dunkerton said it he would personally back the equity raise, and said this shows his commitment  ""to making sure we save jobs and this brand which is a great British success story."" The 59-year-old is the company's largest shareholder and said last month that he would not make an offer for the shares that he does not already own. He acknowledged, however, that Superdry's marketing could have been more ""pinpointed"" to younger shoppers it has been trying to draw in by partnering with influencers and stepping up its social media marketing on Instagram and TikTok. While the High Street brand was once worn by celebrities such as Justin Bieber and David Beckham, it's now favoured by older men looking for practical clothing, according to Alice Price, associate apparel analyst at research firm GlobalData. She suggested the firm's problems mainly lie with its struggle to keep up with the latest trends and prominent branding on some of its T-shirts and hoodies, which has fallen out of fashion. Mr Dunkerton pointed out that it has different logo sizes added to different items, all ""talking to different demographics"", while its 90s-style baggy jeans and cropped T-shirts were performing well with younger people. The fashion brand, known for its coats and hoodies, has seen its share price fall from more than 500p to a little over 5p. Superdry said it wanted to delist from the London markets so it could carry out the restructuring ""away from the heightened exposure of public markets"". As part of the turnaround plan, it will also extend the due date of large loans and wants to boost sales by improving its product ranges and reallocating marketing spend. Despite spending on tie-ups with celebrities such as Brooklyn Beckham and football superstar Neymar Jr, in the six months to the end of October, sales across the group fell 23.5% to £220m as consumer spending was squeezed and shoppers may have been put off heavier clothing items due to ""unseasonal"" weather. Many retailers have struggled with difficult conditions as household budgets and supply chains have come under pressure in the wake of the Covid pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis. ""The ailing fashion player need only look at the likes of Abercrombie and Hollister, which too struggled to shake off their outdated early 2010s aesthetic for many years but have since enjoyed a successful turnaround, having invested in refreshing their product assortment,"" Ms Price added. On Tuesday, boot-maker Dr Martens announced its current boss Kenny Wilson planned to step down as the company faces a ""challenging"" year ahead in the US in particular.

The rising cost of living has meant thousands of businesses have been laying off staff, with many people finding themselves out of work. But about 10.8 million people are out of work, either unemployed or classed as economically inactive. It may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips. There have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. Yvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says ""Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. ""Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,"" she says. ""Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role."" Ms Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online. ""For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. ""So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. ""Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same."" Not all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. Many businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. Miranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: ""Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position. ""They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help."" Lots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. But now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. Other platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. Yvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills. ""Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application."" It can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. Miranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: ""Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for."" It's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. Our career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. Career influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. She's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. ""Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact. Celebrating these wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated"".",2 days ago,business
96,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80zq81zxgvo,Scottish Power pays £300 to customers after overcharging,"Compensation averaging nearly £300 is being paid to some Scottish Power customers after they were overcharged for eight years. Some 1,699 direct debit customers were charged a higher rate than the relevant price cap between 2015 and 2023. Half of the compensation payment is a refund, while the other half is what the company describes as a goodwill gesture following the technical error. It has apologised for the mistake and will also make a donation of £1m to a fund for vulnerable customers. All payments will be made automatically, and customers do not need to do anything. Andrew Ward, from Scottish Power, said: “We’re so sorry that a very small number of our customers were affected by this mistake and faced an increased financial burden – especially during a time when energy prices were reaching an unprecedented high and the government had to step in to provide support."" He said the company took swift action when the error emerged, and reported itself to Ofgem, the sector's regulator. Some customers were wrongly charged under the price capped tariff for those who pay by standard credit, or on receiving a bill. This is higher than the tariff for direct debit billpayers. Ofgem said it took any breaches of the price cap seriously. ""The last few years have been challenging enough for energy customers facing increasing cost-of-living pressures, without the additional hardship of being overcharged,"" said Dan Norton, from Ofgem. But he said the compensation package reflected the ""timely"" response from Scottish Power after the error came to light. Check your direct debit: Your monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year. Your supplier can reduce your bill if your actual use is less than the estimation. Pay what you can: If you can't meet your direct debit or quarterly payments, ask your supplier for an ""able to pay plan"" based on what you can afford. Claim what you are entitled to: Check you are claiming all the benefits you can. The independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide. Read more here",2 days ago,business
97,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68820103,Unemployment jumps as UK jobs market stalls,"The UK jobs market is showing signs of stalling as the number of people out of work rose, according to new figures. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2% between December and February, which is the highest level for six months. Meanwhile, the rate of people with a job dipped and the economically inactive - those not in work or looking for employment - ticked higher. Economists suggested the data could spur the Bank of England to cut interest rates in the summer. ""With employment falling sharply and the unemployment rate climbing, we suspect wage growth will continue to ease in the coming months,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""That may allow the Bank to cut interest rates in June."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, added: ""Easing pressure in the labour market keeps the Bank on track for a summer rate cut."" The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there are ""tentative signs that the jobs market is beginning to cool"". Overall, the ONS said the UK's unemployment rate rose from 3.9% in the three months to January and surpassed economists' forecast of an increase to 4%. In total, there were 1.4 million unemployed people in the UK between December and February, it said. However, other figures showed that while average wage growth, excluding bonuses, edged down from 6.1% to 6% it remained far above forecasts. And, when taking inflation into account, real wages rose by 1.9% in the three months to February. This was the highest since the three months to September in 2021. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt praised the growth in real wages and said that with the government's recent cut in National Insurance for the employed and self-employed , which came into force on 6 April, ""people should start to feel the difference"". But a freeze in income tax thresholds until 2028 means that as people's wages increase they risk entering a higher bracket and paying more tax. Wage growth is a key point monitored by the Bank of England when deciding whether or not to cut interest rates because it can fuel inflation - which measures the pace at which prices are rising. The rate of inflation has been easing. From a record high of 11.1% in October 2022, it slowed to 3.4% in the year to February and new data due out on Wednesday is expected to show a further deceleration for the 12 months to March. But the Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2% and if wages continue to grow there is a risk it could head higher. ""Even though headline inflation is on track to hit its target in the next few months, policymakers are concerned that persistently high pay might cause it to pop back up, and this snapshot does very little to alleviate those fears,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. However, Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Wages lag labour market slack, so these figures will likely embolden the [Bank of England's] monetary policy committee to begin cutting interest rates this summer."" The ONS said employment rate dipped to 74.5% between December and February and the percentage of 16 to 64 year-olds defined as economically inactive rose from 21.8% to 22.2%, which equates to 9.4 million people. But it warned its figures should be treated with a degree of caution because they were based on a smaller sample of household questionnaires than it used to rely on before the Covid pandemic. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said that the jobs market data was ""very volatile so don't read too much into short-term changes"". ""But the trend is clearly poor,"" he added. The number of UK vacancies also slowed, dropping by 13,000 between January and March to 916,000, but the number of jobs that need filling remains above pre-Covid levels. The ONS said the most recent rise in the number of people classed as economically inactive was driven by those aged between 16 and 34 years old. Looking across all age groups, students and those suffering from long-term sickness have fuelled inactivity numbers. Tracy Evans, 59, from Bridlington in Yorkshire, contracted severe long Covid in January 2021 after 30 years as a care assistant. She told the BBC she has been unfit for work due to symptoms such as severe fatigue and brain fog. ""Any exertion I am breathless. I'm tired just having a shower or getting dressed,"" she said. Mrs Evans said that she tried to go back to work last year. ""I thought that would be ok because many of the tasks I was given I could be sat down and resting,"" she said. However, staffing shortages led her health to deteriorate further and left her ""in bed for weeks"". As a result Mrs Evans was forced to give up the job she loved. Labour's Acting Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Alison McGovern, said the latest ONS figures revealed ""the cost of Tory chaos with a record number of people locked out of work due to long-term sickness at terrible cost to them, to business and to the taxpayer paying billions more a year in spiralling benefit bills"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: ""Record levels of people are off work due to long-term sickness, many struggling to access the healthcare they need. It shows this Conservative government's neglect of the NHS is damaging the country's economic recovery."" 1.

The latest UK report showed 4% of people in Scotland were registered as unemployed during December, January and February, a 0.4% drop on the autumn figures. Unemployment across the UK increased 0.3% to 4.2% during the same period. Scotland also saw a 0.5% rise in the number of people in work, compared to a 0.5% drop in the UK as a whole. However,  the ONS warned its labour market surveying is not as reliable as it used to be due to the size of the sample. The latest figures also pointed to a real terms annual increase in Britain's average pay over winter - up by 5.6% including bonuses, and by 1.6% after taking price inflation into account. The ONS said that was the fastest rate of growth in two-and-a-half years. Wage growth is a key measure monitored by the Bank of England when deciding whether or not to cut interest rates because it can fuel inflation, which is the rate consumer prices rise at.

According to official data, gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.3% in the first three months of 2024, compared to a year earlier. That beat expectations the world's second largest economy could see growth slow to 4.6% in the first quarter. Last month, Beijing set an ambitious annual growth target for world's second largest economy of ""around 5%"" . Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed first quarter retail sales growth, a key gauge of China's consumer confidence, fell to 3.1%. ""You cannot manufacture growth forever so we really need to see households come to the party if China wants to hit that around 5% growth target,"" Harry Murphy Cruise from Moody's Analytics told the BBC. In the same period property investment fell 9.5%, highlighting the challenges faced by China's real estate firms. The figures came as China continues to struggle with an ongoing property market crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the sector accounts for around 20% of the economy. The latest data also showed new home prices fell at the fastest pace for more than eight years in March. The real estate industry crisis has been highlighted in January when property giant Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a court in Hong Kong. Rival developers Country Garden and Shimao have also been hit with a winding-up petitions in the city.

100,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68777865,The challenge of upgrading iconic steel windows,"Every winter, architect Kevin Adams would perform his early morning ritual of devotion. Cloth in hand, he'd head to the stylish Crittall windows in the East London flat where he once lived - because these windows, though stylish, were also sopping wet. ""You'd know to expect it - you wipe it down, you open the window as soon as you can, you don't let it puddle or rot the sills,"" he says of the moisture that used to form on the single-glazing and thin steel frames of his windows when the weather was cold. ""I put up with it because I loved them. We do all kinds of things for love, don't we?"" Not everyone who has lived with vintage steel-framed windows feels so affectionate towards them, however. Crittall Windows became synonymous both with modernism - and condensation, which can lead to serious problems such as mould, says Mr Adams, a teaching fellow at the Edinburgh College of Art. While many consider such windows iconic and a key part of British architectural heritage, given today's high energy prices and rising awareness around the dangers of mould , efficient windows have become essential. Crittall, like all other companies in the glazing industry, has had to stay relevant to survive. The firm, now based in Witham, Essex, has been manufacturing steel-framed windows since the 1880s. The frames Crittall developed could be mass produced, then simply cut and welded to fit an array of standard window sizes . The style was popular in both commercial and residential buildings during the 1920s and 1930s but also after World War Two, says Adams. ""Perfect for a post-war economy that was mass building without much money and with a shortage of materials,"" he explains. Factories and warehouses often benefitted from metal-framed windows - lightweight but strong steel meant the frames could be extra thin, allowing more room for glass, which let natural light flood through. Workers appreciated this - but so did the wealthy, who wanted light, airy homes. A large, art deco country house built by Walter Crittall in the 1930s was listed for sale last year at £1.65m. On the Crittall factory floor today, there is a machine that dates to the 1920s. It is still used occasionally for gently bending steel frame sections into curved pieces, says managing director Russell Ager: ""It's an incredible piece of kit."" But the company has moved on in many other ways, he stresses, and nearby machines in the building are now state-of-the-art. ""We've done so much work to improve the thermal performance of the products,"" adds Mr Ager. Today you can get double and even triple-glazed Crittall windows. And crucially, the steel frames are now made with a thermal break, a glass fibre section of insulation within the frame that prevents heat escaping through its structure. The lack of a thermal break is what made the older frames so prone to becoming cold when the weather outside was chilly. Cold glass and steel encourage moisture in the indoor air to condense. The latest Crittall windows can achieve a U-value - a measure of their insulating performance - as low as 0.8, which is better than standard double-glazed windows. They are heftier than the vintage versions but Crittall has retained the classic look of relatively skinny metal frames and rectangular or square panes of glass. TikTok and Instagram accounts focusing on home décor often feature windows such as this, though Crittall has many competitors now that make similar-looking products, admits Mr Ager. According to Mr Adams, in the post-war era, there weren't many other firms operating in the same market as Crittall in the UK. But that has changed. Many companies, including KJM Group and Velfac offer aluminium alternatives. And there are other steel window makers out there, too, such as Fabco. ""Most consumers… buy our product because they love the look of it,"" says Mr Ager. Business, at the moment, is good. During the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, Crittall's sales to residential customers seeking to improve their properties spiked by 30%. And while this was then followed by a decrease, currently the firm's orders in 2024 are up 20% on last year already, says Mr Ager. More technology of business Dated heritage installations reaching the end of their life present another opportunity. Crittall recently replaced 100-year-old windows that the firm had made for a building in Central London with new, energy efficient versions of the same products. This kind of upgrade is not accessible to all, however, because of the relatively high cost of contemporary glazing, notes Claire Bennie, director of Municipal, a housing design and development consultancy. ""Every year we have a chat about it at our AGM and everyone is afraid of taking the plunge,"" she says, referring to residents' meetings at the block of 1930s flats in London where she lives. The old Crittall windows in the property give the building ""elegance"", says Ms Bennie but also makes them ""freezing"". Her own flat's windows are not prone to condensation - but only because they are so draughty that they stay well-ventilated, she explains. It will be increasingly difficult to justify the installation of new metal-framed windows in the future because of the embodied carbon in materials such as steel, says Ms Bennie. To reduce emissions and tackle climate change, sustainable timber building products ought to become more and more prominent, she argues. Mr Ager says Crittall windows are made with 100% recycled steel and the company is working to make its products and operations as sustainable as possible. Other challenges facing the company in the coming years, include the possibility that building regulations in England will change, so as to demand extremely energy efficient windows in new build properties. Stricter standards could mean a need to make the frames thicker still and even better insulated, says Mr Ager: ""The frames would almost become unrecognisable. It would be a big issue for anybody that makes a metal frame."" Sustainability is paramount, stresses Ms Bennie, but she does say the ergonomic design of Crittall windows is hard to beat. The windows are often easy to open into a position where you can reach outside and clean them yourself, for instance. And the classic balcony doors made by the firm fold back neatly so as not to take up precious space outside. ""I wish modern window manufacturers would take a lesson from Crittall,"" she says, ""In how to make windows liveable and a pleasure to use.""",2 days ago,business
101,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68819567,Donald Trump's Truth Social shares drop to lowest since January,"Donald Trump's social media company is eyeing plans to issue millions more shares, just as the former president's hush-money criminal trial begins in New York. The move from Trump Media also marked a step toward letting insiders, including Mr Trump, sell their holdings.The company has already been hit by a wave of selling since official trading started after its formal stock exchange debut in March. Shares fell another 14% on Monday. As Mr Trump sat quiet and motionless in the courtroom shares in the company which runs the social media platform Truth Social slid to less than $28 apiece. It debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange last month, via a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company that was created in 2021 to find a firm to buy and make public. The deal, which briefly sent the share price surging above $70, injected about $200m into the company and has generated billions of dollars in paper wealth for Mr Trump, who is the majority shareholder. Mr Trump, who is currently running for re-election while facing numerous legal battles, is currently barred from selling his shares until about September. In a regulatory filing, Trump Media said a potential 146.1 million shares could be sold, including 114.8 million shares owned by Mr Trump. It also notified investors of plans to issue roughly 21.5 million additional shares in connection with warrants, which give the owner the right to shares at a certain price. Trump Media said it expected to raise about $247m via such sales, which are common after a public listing like Trump Media's. The update, which had been expected, had been in the pipeline for some time. ""There are no new issuances of shares being disclosed for the first time in the preliminary S-1 filed today. All categories of issuances were previously disclosed in public filings prior to the shareholder vote for our merger,"" the company said in a statement. Still, shares in the firm fell to their lowest levels since January after the announcement. Analysts say Trump Media shares remain over-valued compared with the size of Truth Social, which attracted an estimated 7.7 million visits last month. Its auditor has warned it is at risk of failure, after it reported less than $5m (£4m) in sales and more than $50m (£40.1m) in losses in 2023. Analysts have said appetite for Trump Media stock has been boosted by small-time investors, rather than big Wall Street firms. Their bets on the company caused a big spike in the price of Digital World shares when the plan to buy Trump Media was first announced in 2021 and again in January, as Mr Trump emerged as the leading Republican presidential candidate. In recent weeks, Mr Trump has sought to raise confidence in the company, noting that Truth Social was ""the primary way I get the word out and, for better or worse, people want to hear what I have to say"". ""If people who believe in putting America First and want to Make America Great Again, support TRUTH, we will be your Voice like never before,"" he urged his followers on the platform over the weekend.

102,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68812949,Oil prices lower after Iran attack on Israel,"Oil prices fell on Monday after Iran's reprisal attack on Israel over the weekend. Brent crude - a key benchmark for oil prices internationally - was lower but still trading close to $90 a barrel. Prices had already risen in expectation of action by Iran, with Brent crude nearing a six-month high last week. Analysts said the markets would be looking to see how the conflict could affect global supply chains. Oil price fluctuations can cause ripple effects across the world due to countries being heavily reliant on the commodity, which is used to produce fuels such as petrol and diesel. Fuel and energy prices have been a major driver behind the higher cost of living worldwide in the past couple of years. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, oil prices soared to $120 a barrel over supply fears as western nations imposed sanctions on Russia, one of the world's major oil exporters. The jump led to not only higher prices at the pumps, but also countless other goods as businesses adjusted their prices to cover higher costs. Analysts said Israel's reaction to the attack would be key for global markets in the days and weeks ahead. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said the confrontation with Iran is ""not over yet"". His comments came after Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel at the weekend after vowing retaliation for an attack on its consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus on 1 April. Israel has not said it carried out the consulate strike, but is widely believed to have been behind it. At the end of last week, the price of Brent crude touched $92.18 a barrel, the highest since October, but on Monday it fell back to around $89.50. The price of gold - often seen as a safe investment at times of uncertainty - also dropped. After hitting a record high of $2,431.29 an ounce on Friday, gold fell back to $2,332.97 on Monday. Energy analyst Vandana Hari said the fall in the price of oil meant ""clearly, the oil market does not see the need to factor in any additional supply threat at this point"". But Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com said he expected the energy market to be volatile and predicted that oil prices would surge if Israel responded strongly to Iran's move. However, April LaRusse, head of investment at Insight Investment, said it was likely that markets would ""trade sideways until we have more information"". ""Unfortunately this situation in the Middle East has been going on for some time and the longer you have a bit of geo-political tension going on the more markets wait to see and there isn't sort of a panic reaction as the first move,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. Share markets in the Asia-Pacific region slipped on Monday as investors weighed the impact of the attack. The UK's FTSE 100 share index also fell marginally. Russ Mould, investment director at investment firm AJ Bell, said the markets had ""started the week with relative calm"". However, he said there was a ""continuing nervousness among investors"". ""The situation remains fraught and, beyond the geopolitical and humanitarian implications, a more widespread conflict in the Middle East could see energy prices surge and unpick central banks' careful efforts to bring down inflation,"" he added. Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and the third-largest member of the Opec oil producers' cartel. Analysts say that a key issue for the oil price going forward is whether shipping through the Strait of Hormuz will be affected. The Strait - which is between Oman and Iran - is a crucial shipping route, as about 20% of the world's total oil supply passes through it. Opec members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq send most of the oil they export through the Strait. On Saturday, Iran seized a commercial ship with links to Israel as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz.",3 days ago,business
103,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61646214,What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?,"UK airline passengers are facing cancellations or disruption to flights to Israel and surrounding countries owing to tension in the Middle East. Airports and airlines have also had a busy Easter holiday period and will be gearing up for the same over the summer. So what are your rights if your journey is disrupted. If your flight is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight, regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made. You can get your money back for any part of the ticket you have not used. So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded. If you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight. If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport available, then you have a right to be booked onto that alternative transport instead. If you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance until you are able to fly to your destination. This includes: If your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. In this case, the Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary. You are entitled to the same assistance as for a cancellation if your flight is delayed by more than two hours. You may also be able to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late . The amount is based on how far you are flying. If you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund. If you booked a package holiday with a company that is an ABTA member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund. Disruption caused by things like strikes by airport or air traffic control staff, bad weather or other ""extraordinary circumstances"" does not entitle you to extra compensation. However, in other circumstances - when it is considered to be the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law . These apply as long as you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline. What you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you are given. If your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered. The amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling: Airlines will not refund you for loss of earnings. They are only responsible for covering direct costs, such as hotel rooms, meals and alternative flights. They are not obliged to cover consequential losses. Travel insurance policies will not usually cover loss of earnings either. If you think you're going to be late back at work because of flight delays, you have a responsibility to contact your employer to let them know you won't be back as planned, legal experts say. You should agree with your employer how to deal with the absence - for example, by using more annual leave or time banked in lieu. Taking unpaid leave could also be an option. Employers have no legal obligation to pay employees who are absent in this situation, experts say, unless it is stated in their contract.

""All passengers affected by the schedule changes will be provided with rebooking or refund options,"" it added. Israel closed its airspace on Saturday evening after Iran launched its first-ever direct assault on the country. Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel in retaliation for a strike on Tehran's consulate in Damascus on 1 April, which killed a number of senior Iranian commanders. Israel has not said it carried out the consulate strike, but is widely believed to have been behind it. Israel reopened its airspace early on Sunday morning as did Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon, which had stopped flights for a period. German airline group Lufthansa said that it had suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv, Erbil and Amman up to and including Monday, but said they would re-start on Tuesday. However, it said that flights to Beirut and Tehran would remain suspended until at least 18 April. A spokesperson said: ""The Lufthansa Group had already decided on Friday, 12 April, to fly around Iranian airspace up to and including Thursday, 18 April, and thus temporarily suspend flights to Tehran."" Meanwhile, KLM cancelled all flights to and from Tel Aviv until Tuesday. Other airlines are re-routing their flights which could add time to journeys. Australia's Qantas said its planes are changing course to avoid Iran's airspace. Virgin Atlantic said: ""We are not currently overflying Iraq, Iran, or Israel, but we continue to monitor the situation for any potential impact on our operations. ""The safety and security of our customers and people is paramount and always will be. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers by slightly longer flight times."" The airline stopped flying to Israel last year but a spokesperson said it was aiming to resume journeys in September. British Airways said there would be a flight to Tel Aviv on Monday, but added it was keeping the situation under review. The UK flag carrier, which is owned by International Airlines Group (IAG), restarted flights to Israel earlier this month after suspending journeys last October. It had been operating four flights a week to Israel since the beginning of April. Planes stop at Larnaca in Cyprus where there is a crew change to avoid staff staying overnight in Tel Aviv. The flights then operate non-stop from Tel Aviv to the UK. Iberia Express, also owned by IAG, cancelled flights to Tel Aviv on Sunday and Monday. Finnair said that it had suspended operations over Iranian airspace until further notice. Flights from Doha will re-route over Egypt which, a spokesperson said, would result in delays of a ""few minutes"". The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reiterated its previous guidance to airlines to use caution in Israeli and Iranian airspace. ""The European Commission and EASA will continue to closely monitor the situation to assess any potential safety risks for EU aircraft operators and be ready to act as appropriate,"" it said. Qatar Airways said it had resumed flights to Iran, flying to Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz and Isfahan. ""The safety and security of our passengers remains our top priority,"" it said.

105,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240409-heroic-jobs-earn-less-money,The hero tax: Why 'selfless' workers are professionally exploited,"The ""heroisation"" of certain professions has ironic effects on their workers' earning potential. Few people would deny that some professions command a certain reverence. Veterans, firefighters , health workers and teachers ensure our security, save our lives and nurture future generations. It's little wonder that we label them as ""heroes"" – a word that evokes the strength and selflessness that seem evident in the day-to-day responsibilities of these jobs. The warmth of these sentiments may be appreciated, but recent research suggests that the hero label is also loaded with unhelpful assumptions about these workers' personal needs and ambitions. People largely assume, for instance, that heroes simply don't care so much about things like fair compensation for the work that they do. ""This is a clear fallacy in inferential reasoning and logic,"" explains Matthew Stanley , a post-doctoral research associate at Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, US. The consequences in the workplace can be serious. Stanley's research suggests that ""heroisation"" may lead to poorer remuneration, and it can lead others to turn a blind eye to policies that result in worse working conditions. ""We're less concerned about poor treatment,"" says Stanley, ""if the people who are being exploited are 'heroes'."" Stanley was inspired by the experiences of healthcare workers during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many people in his social circle – including his wife – were struggling under the workload, and felt that they were not given the support they needed. ""Politicians would trot out the 'hero label' as praise and appreciation, but it felt pretty empty,"" he says. As a psychologist, Stanley began to wonder whether the very idea of the selfless hero might contribute to their needs being overlooked. If so, this would influence the conditions in many professions besides medicine. Working with Aaron C Kay , a professor at the Fuqua School of Business, he has since designed a series of studies to probe people's assumptions about ""heroic"" professions. The result is a couple of highly intriguing papers, the first of which was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology last year. In their initial two surveys, Stanley and Kay confirmed people consider veterans far more heroic than the average US citizen, and that this was linked to perceptions of selflessness and self-sacrifice. ""People think about them in incredibly positive terms: they want them as friends, coworkers and neighbours,"" says Stanley. ""They're the quintessential heroes group."" The psychologists next examined people's perceptions of the jobs that veterans should seek after leaving the military. In various questionnaires, participants assumed that veterans would find a better fit in roles involving the service of others – such as being fundraiser, paramedic or home-health aide – than in higher-paying positions that are associated with greater self-interest, such as being a private banker or insurance agent. Stanley and Kay saw very similar responses when participants were asked to consider how well veterans would fit into specific organisations. Sure enough, the research subjects assumed someone from the military would be better suited to a job at Habitat for Humanity – a charity that helps build homes for low-income families – over the multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs. Crucially, the researchers found that reinforcing the hero stereotype increases the size of the effect. When the participants saw a logo saying ""hire our heroes"" alongside their questionnaires, for example, they were even more likely to endorse charity work for the veterans. Some veterans may genuinely prefer a lower-paying job that involves serving others, of course – but there will be a large variation in people's tastes. Stanley suspects these underlying assumptions could unfairly ""nudge"" individuals into those professions that fit the selfless stereotype. It is easy to imagine how the hero stereotype might influence the career advice they receive, for instance, or employers' recruitment decisions, so that they have a greater chance of heading into those occupations rather than other industries. Stanley and Kay's second paper looked at the ways that heroisation may encourage exploitation at the workplace across many different fields, such as teaching, nursing, social work and policing. Participants were first asked to rate whether the typical worker in each profession was a hero, on a scale of one (definitely no) to seven (definitely yes). They then had to judge how likely that person would be to volunteer to work an extra day without any reward. As expected, the participants' responses were correlated. When the participants considered a job to be heroic, they had much higher expectations that the workers would sacrifice their day off for free. The researchers' final experiments studied the participants' opposition to policies that would harm workers' rights. Would the hero label reduce or increase people's outrage at news of teachers' pay cuts, for example? To find out, the psychologists provided text detailing a policy to cut schools' budgets, and then asked them to declare their attitude on a scale of one (strongly oppose) to seven (strongly support). In some cases, the text was accompanied by a cartoon image of teachers dressed in superhero costumes; in others, they simply saw the plain text. You might expect that the natural respect we hold for heroes would reduce support for the pay cuts – but this was not the case. Thanks, apparently, to the associations with selfless altruism, the participants tended to show less opposition to the policy when they saw the picture of the teachers in the capes. ""It's brutally ironic,"" says Stanley. ""Because of our veneration, we're more tolerant of them being treated badly."" Stanley's findings chime with the opinons of Nicki Credland , a reader in critical care nursing at the University of Hull, UK. She argues that the hero narrative can undermine the skill and education of her colleagues. ""[It suggests] we do our jobs because we have a calling and an innate desire to help people – but that's no more true of nursing than it is of many other professions,"" she says. ""And it has a negative impact when we want to be appropriately renumerated for the skills and expertise that we have."" More like this: The new paper has also attracted praise from other psychologists. Sapna Cheryan , a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says the results fit neatly with the scientific literature on ""positive stereotypes"". She compares it to the ""poor but happy"" idea – the notion that people on lower incomes somehow live simpler and happier lives – which can reduce people's concerns about the causes of inequality . ""We grant people some positivity and then we undermine them,"" she says. Nadav Klein , an assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Insead's campus in Fontainebleau, France, argues that we will need further research to show that heroisation influences real-world behaviour, though he agrees it is possible. Like other biases, it emerges from our tendency to draw inferences from a ""skeletal understanding of others"", he says. ""People can make mistaken assumptions based on tiny titbits of information."" Such heuristics are common in human reasoning and decision making – and they can be very difficult to correct. The most obvious solution may be to discourage the use of the ""hero"" label – but Stanley doesn't think this would be feasible. It is so widely used to convey respect that it would be difficult to persuade people to stop using it, he says. Instead, he thinks the answer may lie in cultivating greater awareness of the many different reasons that someone could choose a ""heroic"" profession – besides the general wish to help others. Someone might join the military for the specific training and education that comes with the job, for example. Stanley's research has found that describing these motives can prevent people from making crude assumptions about their subsequent career choices. ""We should teach the public about what it is that these people actually want, so that they rely less on the 'caricatures' and stereotypes,"" he says. We are all multifaceted individuals, after all, with many competing needs and ambitions – and recognising this fact need not undermine our respect and admiration for the people who keep us safe, secure and healthy. -- David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

Monika Czuj, 37, from Bedford, started Veggie Crush during the first Covid-19 lockdown, selling fully plant-based salads. When the tumour was discovered last summer, she said: ""I was a single mum, running my business and I was scared."" It was successfully taken out, but to help her recovery she decided to shut her shop and do more meal preparation for deliveries, because ""nothing is stopping me"". Ms Czuj, who moved to Bedford six years ago from Poland, used to work in fraud investigation at the local council, but said she was inspired to make food ""as I'm really passionate about healthy food, healthy living - I love salads, I have one every day"". During the first lockdown she decided to make healthy food for the community in her breaks, as ""people were gaining weight"" - and she believed healthy options were not easily available. ""I did not expect it to take off, the response was so positive,"" she said. She gave up her job at Bedford Borough Council to manage her business full-time and opened a shop on the town's High Street in April 2022. However, the following August doctors ""found a massive tumour - the size of a melon in my chest"". ""We didn't know what was going to happen. Potentially I could have had a few months to live,"" she said. Thankfully it turned out to be non-cancerous and she had successful surgery in London. However, part of a lung had to be removed in the process. Speaking about her recovery, she said: ""I couldn't move my arm, I couldn't talk properly, I couldn't breathe. I lost half of my lung. ""I'm fine now, but the recovery was very long and painful."" Ms Czuj said she decided to shut her shop last October, but was determined to carry on. Switching to meal preparation was ""more manageable for me"", she said, and she has since expanded her deliveries into Milton Keynes and aims to launch meal plans for athletes, women in menopause and people with other health concerns. ""If you want to run a business, you have to stay in business, but run it in different ways. Just don't give up,"" she said. Follow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X . Got a story?

107,https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-68814023,"Universal credit must change to tackle long-term sickness, report says","Universal credit (UC) will need to change to meet the challenges of an older and sicker population, a new report suggests. The number of benefit claimants who are out of work due to ill health has almost doubled since 2013, says the Resolution Foundation. The government recently announced changes to UC aimed at encouraging people with ill health to seek work. The Department for Work and Pensions says UC acts as a ""vital"" safety net. Universal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people. It was introduced in 2013 to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people and the aim was to make the system simpler. There were 6.4 million people on universal credit in January, according to official government statistics , while nearly 40% of claimants were in work. The Resolution Foundation suggests that both the benefit system and the country have changed significantly since the universal credit system started to be phased in. The report found that seven in 10 (71%) families who were eligible for either UC or legacy benefits were worse off in real terms on UC in 2024-25 than they would have been under the legacy benefits system in 2013-14. But this was largely due to cuts in overall levels of working-age support, rather than the design of UC itself, the foundation said. Alex Clegg, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Whoever wins the next election will be governing a 'universal credit Britain', with seven million families eventually receiving the new benefit. ""It is vital that they understand both the system they will inherit and the population that relies on its support."" The unemployment rate has fallen from 8.5% in 2011 to 3.8% in 2023, said the think tank, which focuses on improving the living standards for those on low to middle incomes. But Mr Clegg said that while the problem of higher unemployment has faded in recent years, ""Britain faces new challenges from an older and sicker population"". The Resolution Foundation also looked at who had benefited the most from the change to the benefits system and found this was working families renting their homes. A renting single parent who works 30 hours per week on the National Living Wage is nearly £3,800 per year better off in 2024-25 than they would have been under the old benefits system, it said. Across the 2.7 million families in the private rented accommodation that are eligible for UC, the average gain compared to the old system is £1,200. However, the report also shows that the streamlining of disability premiums means that out-of-work claimants with disabilities are likely to be the worst off. For example, a single person with a long-term disability that prevents them from working would now be £2,800 per year worse off, it suggested. ""Compared to the old system, universal credit offers greater support for renters and stronger incentives to enter work. But its original design did not anticipate there being over two million claimants with poor health or disabilities,"" Mr Clegg added. ""Alongside efforts from the NHS, education, and labour market policy to address the drivers of ill health, UC will need to change to tackle Britain's new challenge of long-term sickness."" Concerns have been raised by business leaders and policymakers about worker shortages affecting the economy. The number of people not employed or actively looking for work has remained at a persistently high level in recent years since it first surged during the pandemic. Long-term illness has been cited as one of the main reasons for roughly a third of the working-age, inactive population not being in the labour force. It saw Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announce in November that reforms including stricter fit-to-work tests and jobseeker support would get 200,000 more people into work. Under those plans, the government also wants to scrap the controversial Work Capability Assessment . The Resolution Foundation projects that by 2028, entitlements to UC would work out as about £86bn a year, although this is £14bn less than if the government had kept the former system in place. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: ""Universal credit has proven itself as a modern benefits system fit for the future, providing a vital safety net to millions while helping people move into work faster."" It also pointed to the fact that the UC standard allowance - the basic amount before additional payments or reductions for things like savings are taken into account - went up earlier this month. ""Work is the best path to long-term financial security and through universal credit, our £2.5bn Back to Work Plan will help over a million people - including those with long-term health conditions - find, stay and succeed in work,"" they added.",3 days ago,business
108,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68796980,Little Chefs: What happened to roadside diner chain,"With 439 restaurants on major routes across the UK, Little Chef once enjoyed a near monopoly on roadside dining. So, why did the restaurant chain disappear? Many of us have fond memories of childhood visits to a Little Chef. Lawrence Wosskow from Sheffield remembers the free sweets. ""We always got a lollipop when we were there,"" he says, recalling family visits en route to Bournemouth for his summer holidays. ""We always used to look forward to going. When you saw a Little Chef, you knew it was going to be good."" Lawrence took his love for Little Chef into adulthood, growing up to become a successful entrepreneur who ended up buying the restaurant chain. He was one of many Little Chef owners during its 60-year history. Little Chef was started in 1958 by catering boss Peter Merchant and caravan manufacturer Sam Alper. The pair had witnessed the popularity of roadside diners on business trips to the United States and decided to bring their own version to the UK. Car ownership was growing and the UK's road network was expanding. Sam Alper's widow, Fiona, believes her husband spotted an opportunity. ""I suspect Sam had that vision that all these people and their cars would need somewhere to stop and have a decent, affordable meal"". Merchent and Alper opened their first Little Chef in Reading, Berkshire, in a tiny, pre-fabricated building with seats for just 11 customers. Around a decade later, the company was bought by Trust Houses Ltd, which later became known as Trusthouse Forte after merging with Charles Forte's hotel and catering business. Little Chef, famous for its Olympic Breakfasts and cherry-sauced filled Jubilee Pancakes, went from strength to strength, and budget hotels known as 'Little Chef Lodges' were built next to some of the restaurants. Later they were rebranded as 'Travelodges' after the American motel brand which Charles Forte had also bought. In 1996, media conglomerate, Granada, acquired Trusthouse Forte and began opening Little Chef branches at its motorway service stations. Restaurant numbers peaked at 439. The business' decline was ""gradual"" according to Becky Parr-Phillips who started working for Little Chef as a waitress in the 1990s, rising through the managerial ranks to become head of operations around 15 years later. The owners were keen to reduce costs and maximise profits as the chain still enjoyed something of a monopoly on roadside dining. ""There were closures, the prices were hiked, you know the guests did start to call it Little Thief rather than Little Chef"", says Becky. The restaurant chain's owners, Granada, had merged with Compass Group before selling the Little Chef and Travelodge businesses to the private equity firm, Permira. By the time Lawrence Wosskow bought Little Chef from Permira in 2005, there were 234 restaurants left and he says many of them were in need of refurbishment. He and his business partner, Simon Heath, sold the restaurant buildings and leased them back from their new owners raising millions of pounds to improve them. Customers were no longer as keen to stop for a sit-down meal, so dozens of coffee and sandwich outlets were added to Little Chef restaurants. They aimed to capture people on the go, along with Burger King outlets that were already operating under franchise inside some Little Chef branches. Lawrence says the sale and leaseback deal was ""absolutely the right thing to do"" and that price cuts also helped to bring customers back. But he says bad weather during the peak summer trading period in 2006 hit sales and he had a heart attack which almost killed him. Doctors told him to avoid ""any stressful situation"" meaning he had to step back from the business. He describes it as ""one of the toughest periods"" of his life. Little Chef went bust, entering administration less than 18 months after Lawrence Wosskow had bought it. The turnaround specialists, Rcapital, led a rescue bid and became Little Chef's new owners. They brought in celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal to revamp the menu as part of a Channel 4 documentary. Blumenthal's new menu was acclaimed by restaurant critics but was only ever introduced at a handful of Little Chefs. Rcapital refurbished restaurants while closing others, selling the business for a £6m profit to the Kuwaiti company, Kout Food Group (KFG), in 2013. By then, there were 78 restaurants left. Becky Parr-Phillips who was head of operations under KFG says they were ""really passionate"" about turning the brand around and did start to invest although ""potentially a little too late"". By then, she says, consumer habits had changed and there was a lot more competition from petrol station forecourts which were offering a much improved range of hot drinks and food. Peter Harden, the editor and director of Harden's restaurant guide says the ""secret sauce"" of hospitality is good service as well as having a good food offering. ""The whole ethos was a slightly dated one and I think with those sorts of heritage brands, you still need to find ways of keeping them fresh and relevant. ""They just didn't manage to refresh their offering enough at the same time as keeping their workforce focused on making people feel valued,"" he says. In 2017, KFG retained the Little Chef name but sold its remaining restaurant buildings to Euro Garages for an undisclosed sum. Euro Garages wanted the buildings to expand their franchise operation with well-known brands like Greggs and Starbucks. Around a year after the sale, Little Chef restaurants had all quietly disappeared from the UK's road network, replaced with more modern, on-the-go food outlets. Ultimately it had failed to remain relevant to enough customers to survive in the face of new competition. Lawrence Wosskow thinks so, but he believes it needed fewer restaurants and much more money spent on refurbishing them and marketing the business. Becky Parr-Phillips looks back fondly on the years she spent working at Little Chef, but in the end concludes sadly ""it just wasn't quite offering what people were after"".

110,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68792632,Ex-Post Office Alan Cook boss regrets 'hand in the till' email about sub-postmasters,"Former Post Office managing director Alan Cook has said he will ""regret for the rest of my life"" an email in which he wrote that subpostmasters had their ""hands in the till"". ""What I wrote in that email was unacceptable"", Mr Cook told an inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal. The email, sent in 2009 to the Royal Mail Group's press officer, said the IT was ""stable and reliable"". More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to the software. Mr Cook was in charge of the Post Office from 2006 to 2010. Writing to Mary Fagan, he had said: ""For some strange reason, there is a steadily building nervousness about the accuracy of the Horizon system and the press are on it now as well."" He wrote that the system had been stable and reliable for many years and there was ""absolutely no logical reason why these fears should now develop"". ""My instincts tell me that, in a recession, subbies [sub-postmasters] with their hand in the till choose to blame the technology when they are found to be short of cash."" During the inquiry, Mr Cook also said that he did not realise the organisation itself was prosecuting victims of the Horizon IT scandal. Instead, he thought it was the police or CPS, he told the inquiry into the wrongful prosecutions of hundreds of sub-postmasters due to faulty software. He told the inquiry he did not know that prosecutions were being brought solely by the Post Office until 2009. He said when he was told cases ""went to court"" he presumed that the police had been involved, and only found out later that roughly two thirds of cases against Horizon victims had been brought by the Post Office. ""One of my regrets is that I didn't pick up on that earlier,"" he said. The involvement of the Post Office in prosecuting its own staff created a risk that it wasn't taking independent decisions, he said. Mr Cook added that there would have been a ""higher bar"" that needed to be reached had the prosecutions been independent. He said it was a ""regret"" that he had misunderstood notes and minutes that had made it clear that the Post Office carried out its own prosecutions. ""It never occurred to me that the Post Office was the sole arbiter of whether or not that criminal prosecution would proceed,"" he said. During Mr Cook's time at the top, the Post Office secured 292 Horizon convictions in England and Wales. These years saw some of the highest numbers of convictions using Horizon data, according to evidence submitted to the inquiry by Simon Recaldin, director of the Post Office's remediation unit. More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for offences including theft and false accounting after their books didn't balance due to errors in the Horizon software. Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office itself took many cases to court, prosecuting 700 people. Similarly to Mr Cook, former chief executive of the Royal Mail Group Adam Crozier also said he was not aware that lawyers within the group conducted prosecutions. He told the inquiry he did not have a ""developed understanding"" of how Royal Mail carried out prosecutions. Adam Crozier was appointed chief executive officer of Royal Mail on 1 Feb 2003, and left on 31 March 2010. Royal Mail was the owner of the Post Office during that time. According to evidence submitted to the Horizon Inquiry by Simon Recaldin, Director of the Post Office's remediation unit, these years saw some of the highest numbers of convictions using Horizon evidence. He was asked: ""Is the truth of the matter that in your position you did not have a developed understanding of the extent to which Royal Mail prosecuted or the way in which things were or were not carried into effect?"" Mr Crozier responded: ""I'm not a lawyer. I would not claim it is my area of expertise"". He also said he was ""not in the slightest"" involved in the procurement of Horizon as the Post Office's IT system. Former sub-postmaster Janet Skinner was given a nine-month sentence in 2007 over an alleged shortfall of £59,000 from her Post Office branch in Bransholme, Hull. She served three months in prison before being released with an electronic tag, but eventually had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021. Ms Skinner told the BBC executives like Alan Cook should have been aware of what was happening in the business. ""He had a high position, and you're telling me that he wasn't aware of what was going on in the business?"" She said if Mr Cook didn't understand that the Post Office had been bringing prosecutions ""he shouldn't have had the position he was in"". ""He was getting paid a lot of money to overview what was going on in the business, and therefore he should have known what was going on,"" she added.",6 days ago,business
111,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68797651,"Bank of England: 'Serious deficiencies' in economy forecasts, review finds","The Bank of England's economic forecasting system has ""serious deficiencies"" that need to be modernised, according to a review. The independent report by Dr Ben Bernanke, former head of the US central bank, found staff used outdated systems that should be overhauled or replaced. He found there had been serious under-investment in the Bank's software. But Governor Andrew Bailey said updating the Bank's systems was a ""high priority"". The former head of the Federal Reserve, said that a ""material degree"" of under-investment had led to staff using a ""complicated and unwieldy system"". This holds staff back from producing useful analysis on what might happen to the economy, he said. Updating and modernising how its system handles economic data should be completed ""with high priority"" and ""as rapidly as feasible"", Dr Bernanke said in the critical review. He was asked to carry out the review last July after the UK's central bank came under fire from MPs for failing to anticipate the scale or duration of inflation - which measures how prices rise over time - over the past two years. Responding for the Bank of England, Governor Andrew Bailey said: ""Substantial investment is being made to develop our infrastructure and to update our system. It's a high priority."" Governor Bailey was criticised by members of Parliament and independent economists for allowing a surge in inflation worse than both the US and eurozone. However, Dr Bernanke said central banks across the world faced the same problems with forecasting models being disrupted by unprecedented economic shocks. Inflation began to rise above the Bank of England's 2% target in the summer of 2021 as the global economy bounced back from the pandemic and the supply of commodities from petrol to food struggled to keep up with resurgent demand. That was made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which cut the supply of commodities from gas to sunflower oil and forced up prices further. In the UK, inflation hit a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, placing serious pressure on the budgets of both businesses and households. Mr Bailey said repeatedly throughout late 2021 and early 2022 that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, believed the surge in inflation was ""transitory"". However, the spike in inflation proved more sustained than expected and started to translate into higher pay rises. Between December 2021 and August 2022, the central bank raised interest rates 14 times in a row to try to bring inflation under control. Higher interest rates have led millions of mortgage borrowers to face a ""payment shock"", where their monthly payments jump to a much higher level as they come to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals. Further upward pressure on inflation came from an unexpected shortage of available workers, partly due to the effects of long-term sickness such as long Covid. That led employers in the private sector to increase wages to attract and retain staff. Governor Bailey has admitted the Bank's forecasting models failed to anticipate this, which led to a tighter labour market and therefore a greater susceptibility to inflation. Dr Bernanke's review recommends the Bank must thoroughly update its whole framework for forecasting the economy, overhauling or scrapping its existing software, known as Compass (Central Organising Model for Projection Analysis and Scenario Simulation). He said the models should take into account how higher prices can cause higher wages - as well as vice versa. He also said the Bank of England's forecasting models should pay greater attention to factors like the supply of labour and supply chain disruptions. And he said the Bank should lay less emphasis on its ""central forecast"", where it justifies moves in interest rates based on what it regards as the most likely path for inflation over the next one or two years. Scenarios should also be published which might prove its forecast wrong, he said, such as disruptions to supply chains, as well as relying on its own forecasters more instead of City traders. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank Research, suggested that more work would be needed to get the Bank's forecasting systems up to scratch. He pointed out some tweaks to the MPC's communications would be coming in to improve transparency around how it makes interest rate decisions. But, the review would not be ""a game change for how policy is conducted"", he added. Tackling It Together: More tips to help you manage debt",6 days ago,business
112,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240409-how-much-it-costs-to-attend-coachella,How much it costs to attend Coachella,"The annual music festival in the California desert draws thousands of people to see some of the world's biggest acts. Tickets are expensive – but the Coachella experience can be priceless. In the US's vast landscape of music festivals, Coachella is in a league of its own. Held in the Southern California desert, it draws an annual attendance of nearly 650,000 across two weekends in April, making it the largest music festival in the country . This year, the three-day event begins on 12 April and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend. Many of them are repeat attendees who describe a meticulously well-organised and picturesque adult playground in the Coachella Valley, brought to life by an eclectic roster of artists, who often go the extra mile for the premier event. (Think surprise guest performances , reunions , new music debuts and even a hologram of the late rap legend Tupac Shakur .) Many people are willing to lay out a lot of money for the experience and party in the VIP section, but it's possible to get by on a budget, too. Compared to the past 11 times he's attended, Harry Levin is finding this year's festival logistics more complicated. The former Los Angeles resident used to be able to drive to the Coachella Valley, but this time he's flying in from his new home in Denver, Colorado. The freelance writer was more into electronic dance music (EDM) festivals before attending his first Coachella in 2013, when he couldn't pass up the chance to see Southern California's own Red Hot Chilli Peppers headline the event. ""If you had seen me and my friends, you'd think we're the weird guys everyone's avoiding because they're having too much fun. But to be honest, that's how I feel about music inside all the time,"" he says. ""Coachella was the first place I felt like I could truly express that."" Levin, who likens the event to a ""religious experience"" for music lovers, no longer camps out at the festival, as he did his first five years. This year he's flying into LA, where he'll spend the Wednesday before the festival gates open at his father's house, then drive about 125 miles (201km) south-east to the venue the next morning. That leaves two nights at a hotel, if he drives back to his dad's at the end of the festival on Sunday night. Levin says the flight will cost about $200 (£158), the hotel will be about $440 (£348), and he'll need to rent a car for about $250 (£198). He's also budgeting about $120 (£95) worth of petrol and $350 (£277) for food and drinks, and has already purchased his $560 (£445) general admission weekend pass. As for the culture, Levin encourages the uninitiated not to be discouraged by constant complaints that the event has catered too much to social media influencers over the real music lovers. ""Don't let the haters affect your experience,"" he says. ""If you're just going to hang out and listen to tunes, you will have the best time."" For 32-year-old Michael Luis, what makes Coachella special are the once-in-a-lifetime moments in music history. His first experience in 2012 didn't disappoint, giving the then 20-year-old the opportunity to see two of his favourite bands – At the Drive-in and Refused – reunite on stage, along with resurrection of Tupac in hologram form. ""I quickly realized it was more than just a music festival – it's more of a cultural event,"" he says. That year the Canadian communications professional from British Columbia says the whole experience cost him less than $1,200 (£950). That's because he and three friends split the 22-hour drive south in a single vehicle, and intentionally arrived early to snag a campsite close to the front gates. That enabled them to avoid spending on concessions, returning to the campsite for food and drinks throughout the weekend. ""If you're smart with it, and you spend your money on the right things, you can do it quite affordably – especially if you're a California local or even live within a 12-hour drive."" For his sixth time visiting this year, however, Luis says he and three friends are spending about $400 (£317) each on flights, splitting a rental car for about $250 (£198) a piece and bringing camping gear from home. Combined with a $560 ticket to the festival, a $150 (£119) parking pass and $100 (£79) per day for food and alcohol, he expects the whole experience to run him about $1,760. He argues it's an incredible value. ""Seeing just the headliners at an arena show will cost you $300 to $400 each,"" he says. Luis adds that Coachella has an unfortunate reputation for being a playground for the privileged, and emphasises the event can suit a range of budgets. ""People have a misconception that it's this party in the desert for California's wealthy elite,"" he says. ""When you go to the campgrounds, it's a lot of students, working class people, eating peanut butter sandwiches, just wanting to see the bands they like with their friends."" For Elena Suarez, the cost of renting a house and getting a VIP pass is worth every penny. To the Los Angeles-based line producer, the event is about more than just music, and she wants to be comfortable and well rested while she and her friends soak it all in. She says Coachella is her favourite event on the calendar – she looks forward to it more than Christmas – and compares it to ""adult Disneyland"" or a late-spring break. Now, Suarez is just as excited for her 12th Coachella weekend as she was for her first in 2011. Before dropping $1,200 on a VIP pass, however, Suarez warns that the more expensive ticket won't get you a much better vantage point at headlining performances, as it does at other events. It will, however, save hours of waiting in lines; provide access to cleaner and less busy restrooms; and admission to Suarez's favourite corner of the sprawling venue, the Rose Garden. ""It feels like you're in a Parisian park, it's just so beautiful,"" she says. More in How Much It Costs: Suarez says she typically rents a home along with about 15 friends, where they spend their days before and after the festival barbecuing poolside, taking a dip in the hot tub and listening to the artists they'll see at the venue. The home they rent each year, which is about a mile and a half from the festival, costs about $1,400 (£1,109) per person with two to a room. Suarez says that in 2022, she spent about $3,250, which included $150 for a preferred parking spot and another $150 per person to split a minivan rental, plus groceries, accessories and other miscellaneous costs. That year, she also bought her ticket late and had to settle for the more expensive Tier 2 pricing, which ran her $1,400. But last year, those costs went down to about $2,700 when the group ditched the van and secured their VIP passes at the Tier 1 rate of about $1,200 with fees. ""If you rent a house and you don't have to rent a car, for VIP I'd say expect to spend $2,500 to $3,500,"" she says. For Hernán Montfort, Coachella is synonymous with good vibes. Since 2019, Mexico-based Montfort has taken an annual break from his day job in strategy at the Monterrey Institute of Technology to reunite with college friends – now dispersed around the globe – at the festival just north of the border. ""I like the positive vibe, and also as an engineer I really enjoy when something is really well organised – when the logistics go better than you expect,"" he says, describing the event like a well-oiled machine. Montfort jokes that each year he and his friend group, which has grown from five to 11 members over the years, swear that it will be their last – but inevitably purchase early-bird tickets as soon as they go on sale. Each time they return, he says costs run between $2,000 and $2,500, which includes the roughly $200 flight from Monterrey, Mexico; five nights in a hotel, at a cost of about $600 to $700 (£475 to £555) per person; about $100 to $150 on a rental van; festival passes; and other costs such as food, gas, clothing and accessories. ""You could spend around the same at an all-inclusive in the Caribbean, but I believe a festival and a trip like this is a super way to spend your money, to have a good time, and to make memories,"" he says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",6 days ago,business
113,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68797646,Motor finance: Firms warned to hold cash back for probe,"The UK's financial watchdog has warned motor finance firms to hold back cash for potential payouts as it continues an investigation into the sector. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also revealed that firms ""are struggling to promptly provide"" data for the probe. About 17,000 people have made already made complaints to an ombudsman. The cases surround commission arrangements between lenders and car dealers. Some lenders had allowed dealers to adjust interest rates, which would improve the commission they received. As a result, these arrangements created an incentive for brokers to increase how much people were charged for their car loan. In 2021, the FCA banned these discretionary commission arrangements, following a review, claiming it would collectively save drivers £165m a year, or about £100-£200 on a loan. The potential cost of compensation has raised some comparisons to the amount paid out during the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal, which cost banks tens of billions of pounds. In February, banking giant Lloyds said it had set aside £450m to cover the potential cost of the investigation. Lloyds is seen as the most exposed of the major banks to any claims as it owns one of the UK's largest motor finance providers, Black Horse. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme at the time, Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn said: ""The extent of any misconduct or loss on behalf of customers, if any, remains very unclear so we welcome the FCA's announcement a few weeks ago to look into this to provide clarity for customers and the industry."" Barclays, meanwhile, is challenging a ruling that it unfairly paid commission to a car finance broker. When the FCA first announced its probe in January, it cited two cases, including that of a ""Miss L"", who was found to have been mis-sold car finance by Barclays Partner Finance. The Financial Ombudsman ruled that the bank ""had failed to act fairly"" as the customer had not been made aware that her package included a £1,600 commission to a credit broker. Barclays is appealing the decision, although according to Sky News reports , it has complied with the award required by the ombudsman. In the update on Friday, the FCA also said it had faced issues getting the necessary information from various companies to conduct its investigation. ""Firms involved in our review have engaged with us constructively. However, many firms are struggling to promptly provide the data we need,"" it said. Claims for compensation can be made if you bought a motor vehicle on finance before 28 January 2021 and the finance provider and car dealer had a discretionary commission arrangement.

114,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68596871,GDP: Economy grew in February increasing hopes UK is out of recession,"The UK economy grew slightly in February increasing hopes it is on its way out of recession. The economy grew by 0.1%, official figures show, boosted by production and manufacturing in areas such as the car industry. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that construction was dampened by wet weather though. This is an early estimate, but signals how the UK, which entered recession at the end of 2023, is faring. Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said that looking across the three months to February as a whole, the economy grew for the first time since last summer. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt suggested that the new figures were a ""welcome sign that the economy is turning a corner"". ""We can build on this progress if we stick to our plan,"" he added. Growing the economy was one of five key pledges that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made last year as consumers and businesses were squeezed by higher prices and interest rates. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, however, argued that ""Britain is worse off with low growth and high taxes"". She added: ""The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken."" Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see gross domestic product (GDP) overall rising steadily because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. The official statistics body also revised its previous estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) in January from 0.2% growth up to 0.3%. In February, output from the UK's production industry led the economy's growth, rising by 1.1%, compared to a fall of 0.3% in January. The construction sector saw output fall by 1.9% though as persistent rain hampered building projects. The services sector, which includes things like hairdressing and hospitality, also grew a little with public transport and haulage having a strong month. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that February's overall figures offered a strong signal that the recession, which is defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row, may already be over. Growth is likely to have been boosted by cuts in National Insurance and slowing price rises, meaning that businesses and households will have more confidence in their finances and therefore spending. But she added that consumer spending is still fragile and business investment could be dented by uncertainty around a general election. Andrew Watson is chief financial officer at Goodfellow, a metal manufacturer based in Cambridge which supplies research and development around the world. He said last year the firm was hit by disruption from attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and supply chains were tight after the pandemic, ""but overall we saw growth"". ""You've got this weird mix of the economy not doing so well in terms of GDP and yet we feel like we've got opportunities to grow - and we just have to push forward and access those opportunities,"" he said. He suggested that growth in the UK had been ""anaemic"" since covid, with more opportunities presenting themselves in the United States. Other countries' economies have also faced energy price shocks and supply chain delays in the wake of the pandemic driving up costs, as well as the potential knock-on effects from conflict overseas, but the UK has seen growth stagnating for some time. Dr Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, suggested that there were few signs of a ""strong"" economic reboundin the UK and that some parts of the services industry like hotels and hospitality were still struggling. Other economists pointed out the impact of previous interest rate rises by the Bank of England was still feeding through to the economy. Currently, experts are split on when the UK's central bank may start cutting interest rates over the summer, potentially providing some relief to mortgage-holders and borrowers. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee takes into account a range of economic figures when making its decision on its base rate, although monthly figures such as February's can be quite volatile and are ""unlikely"" to do much change to its thinking, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.",6 days ago,business
115,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyerg64dn97o,Biden urged to ban China-made electric vehicles,"President Joe Biden has been urged to ban imports of Chinese-made electric cars to the US. The chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Sherrod Brown, wrote ""Chinese electric vehicles are an existential threat to the American auto industry"". His comments are the strongest yet by any US lawmaker on the issue, while others have called for steep tariffs to keep Chinese electric vehicles (EV) out of the country. In February, the White House said the US was opening an investigation into whether Chinese cars pose a national security risk. ""We cannot allow China to bring its government-backed cheating to the American auto industry"", Senator Brown said in a video on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. Senator Brown, who is a Democrat from the the car-producing state of Ohio, is seeking to win a fourth term in office in November's election. The White House did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. In February, President Biden said that China's policies ""could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security"" and that he would ""not let that happen on my watch."" Washington could impose restrictions over concerns that the technology in  Chinese-made cars could ""collect large amounts of sensitive data on their drivers and passengers"", the White House said. It warned cars that are connected to the internet ""regularly use their cameras and sensors to record detailed information on US infrastructure; interact directly with critical infrastructure; and can be piloted or disabled remotely"". China is the world's largest producer of cars and vying with Japan to be the biggest exporter of vehicles. The number of Chinese cars on US roads is, however, extremely low due to the fact the latter currently imposes a 27.5% tariff on the vehicles. This week, while on a trip to China, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Beijing that Washington would not allow a repeat of the ""China shock"" of the early 2000s, when Chinese imports flooded into America. In response, China's vice finance minister, Liao Min, expressed ""grave concern"" over restrictions the US has imposed on trade and investment. Mr Liao said China's competitive advantages are due to its ""large-scale market, complete industrial system and abundant human resources"". Also on Thursday, America's biggest airlines asked the Biden administration to halt approvals of new flights between the US and China. In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg they said China's “damaging anti-competitive policies” put US carriers at a disadvantage. “If the growth of the Chinese aviation market is allowed to continue unchecked and without concern for equality of access in the market, flights will continue to be relinquished to Chinese carriers at the expense of US workers and businesses.” The world's two biggest economies have been locked in a trade war since 2018 when the then-Trump administration imposed tariffs on more than $360bn (£287bn) of Chinese goods. Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products. President Joe Biden has largely kept those tariffs in place. Last year the value of goods the US bought from China fell by just over 20% to $427bn. At the same time, US exports to China dipped by 4% to just under $148bn.",6 days ago,business
116,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68761255,Even in peaceful countries be ready for a siren blast,"I was halfway through my morning run when I heard it. The sound of the apocalypse. An air raid-style siren, slowly wailing up and down in pitch, was blaring over Belfast at 0830 GMT. I glanced at the sky. But nobody else nearby seemed to be taking any notice. My wife, who had her earphones in, hadn't heard the noise at all until I pointed it out. It was the same at the supermarket on the way home. The din of the siren was audible across East Belfast, and yet, life continued as normal. The bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel storage facility in Belfast Harbour. It is a fire alarm and has to be so loud partly because of the large size of the facility in question. This kind of siren, so strongly associated in Britain with World War Two, is actually more than a century old, and has been used for all kinds of emergencies - not just Luftwaffe bombing raids. Other sounds and tones are sometimes deployed for outdoor alerts, but that lazily wavering siren that is so strange and chilling is still in place at multiple sites around the country - from military bases to chemical factories. Just in case. ""That wail pattern does a great job,"" says Evan Kerr, VP of operations at Sentry Siren, a US firm that still makes mechanical sirens. ""You need to get people's attention."" He explains that the sound is produced by a fast rotating fan inside a flat cylindrical housing, the outer rim of which is perforated with slits. It's the forcing of air through these slits, at oscillating speeds, that creates the extremely loud wail in all directions. These days, this sound can be replicated by a digital recording played through loudspeakers but Mr Kerr argues that mechanical wailing sirens, which have been manufactured since at least 1905, are proven, reliable and nearly maintenance-free. He says some sirens made by his firm, previously known as Sterling Siren Fire Alarm Company, have been in place for many decades. In the UK, there are air raid-style sirens in a number of locations. Notably, at the Royal Navy base in Portsmouth. This siren, which is tested regularly , would be used to warn members of the public about an accident with the nuclear-powered submarines that are stationed there. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence says that there are also outdoor warning alarms at naval bases on the River Clyde in Scotland and Devonport in Plymouth: ""The sirens are regularly maintained and monitored. There are no plans to change the emergency alarm system."" Some siren locations are, perhaps, less obvious. Take The State Hospital , a psychiatric hospital in Carstairs, Scotland. Its siren system was sounded, for example, when two murderers escaped in the 1970s. Broadmoor used to have a siren but this was decommissioned in 2019 and, if a dangerous individual were to escape the hospital now, an alert would be sent to locals in the form of an email or text message . Industrial sites that handle significant quantities of hazardous materials are also legally required to have outdoor warning systems. Take Hampton Water Treatment Works in West London - even it has a siren . In Bradford, there is a siren at a large chemical plant owned by Solenis. In information sent to locals, the company explains why an accident might be harmful. A toxic cloud could form or, for example: ""A release of a flammable vapour, with subsequent ignition, may result in an explosion with the potential for damage both within the Solenis site, and outside its boundaries."" Advice from the company explains that, if people hear the siren when it is not due to be tested, they should shelter in their homes, close all windows and curtains, block incoming draughts, switch on the radio and ""stay calm and rest"". More technology of business In Huddersfield, chemical company Syngenta makes insecticides and other agricultural products. It too has a siren system in place to warn people in the event of a chemical emergency . These are just some examples. There are dozens of outdoor warning sirens around the UK and many, though not all, use the familiar wailing pattern of a traditional air raid-style siren. One siren aficionado has even marked the locations of these systems on an online map. The bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel processing facility in Belfast Harbour. But online rumours had claimed the noise signalled the movement of cranes at Belfast's famous Harland & Wolff (H&W) shipyard. H&W confirms that this was not the case. The incident raises the question: Would people react appropriately during a real emergency? People must be informed about what sirens in their area might be used for says Andrea Davis, president and chief executive of The Resiliency Initiative, a US firm that advises communities on emergency management. ""So [they] are familiar - 'Hey, I know this sound, it's not a scary sound, it's an action sound - I need to do something',"" she explains. Failing to activate a siren during an emergency could also be harmful. Mrs Davis criticises officials in Hawaii for not using outdoor sirens when a devastating wildfire hit Maui in August 2023. Erica Kuligowski, a social scientist at RMIT University in Australia, who has studied the efficacy of emergency warning systems agrees that sirens must be packaged with additional information that makes it clear what the warning is about, and what people should do in response. ""We need a series of pieces of information or else it's difficult to prompt people to act,"" she says. The range of situations that might require a siren around the world are extremely varied. Sentry Siren, for instance, recently shipped five of its units to Iceland. They'll be used to alert people to volcanic activity, which has caused significant disruption in Iceland in recent months. And Monika Pavlik, international business manager at Telegrafia, a Slovakia-based siren manufacturer, says her firm's devices have been deployed in Ukraine where they are used as contemporary air raid warning systems. Countries neighbouring Ukraine, fearful of Russian aggression, are increasingly interested in such sirens, she adds: ""It is a constant threat."" Telegrafia specialises in sirens that use digital recordings rather than mechanical components for producing noise. But this means the devices can blast verbal information across an area or turn text into explanatory spoken word announcements. The company's sirens, which are installed in 93 countries around the world, can also be triggered automatically - for example by sensors detecting a flood. Or, a government could set off connected sirens across an entire country in the event of a nationwide emergency. These days, sirens tend to make the news as false alarms, or when tests of siren systems are reported locally. Most of the time, thankfully, there's no emergency. There's always a risk that people will ignore these audible warnings when something really has gone wrong, however, which is why taking multiple steps to inform the public about an unfolding disaster or accident is so important, say experts. Despite the rise of alternative technologies such as mobile phone alerts, there is still huge demand for traditional outdoor warning sirens, says Mr Kerr of Sentry Siren: ""Why wouldn't you use all the tools available to you?""",6 days ago,business
117,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68787990,Sub-postmistress jailed while pregnant rejects ex-Post Office boss' apology,"A former sub-postmistress who was wrongly jailed while she was pregnant has rejected an apology by a former Post Office boss who congratulated the team behind her conviction. ""Brilliant news. Well done,"" wrote then managing director David Smith in an email to colleagues in 2010. Seema Misra was eight weeks pregnant with her second child when she was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Mr Smith apologised to Mrs Misra at the inquiry into the Post Office scandal. He said that in hindsight, his email following her conviction was ""poorly thought through"". But following Thursday's evidence, Mrs Misra told the BBC: ""How can I accept the apology? They need to apologise to my 10 year old, they took his mum away on his birthday. ""I was eight weeks pregnant - they need to apologise to my youngest son. It was terrible. I haven't accepted the apologies."" Mrs Misra was sent to Bronzefield prison on the day of her eldest son's 10th birthday after being wrongly convicted of stealing £70,000 from her Post Office branch in the village of West Byfleet in Surrey. She served four-and-a-half months and gave birth to her second son wearing an electronic tag. She told the BBC that she had seen Mr Smith's email before. ""Seeing it again makes me more and more angry,"" she added. Mrs Misra was one of more than 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 for theft and false accounting after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches. Some, like Mrs Misra, were convicted and sent to prison. Many others were left financially ruined and lost their jobs, businesses and homes. Some died while waiting for justice. Hundreds of people wrongly convicted are set to have their names cleared under new legislation expected to come into force in July, but when it comes to financial redress, just 37 people have received full and final compensation settlements to date. Mr Smith was managing director of the Post Office from April to October 2010. His brief stint in charge was prior to Paula Vennells - who was heavily depicted in the ITV drama which thrust the scandal back into the spotlight - taking up the role as chief executive from 2012 to 2019. In his witness statement to the public inquiry, Mr Smith said his email following Mrs Misra's conviction was ""intended to be a congratulatory"" to the legal team. ""Brilliant news. Well done. Please pass on my thanks to the team,"" said Mr Smith's 2010 email. Asked by Sam Stevens, counsel to the inquiry, on Thursday why Mrs Misra's conviction was ""brilliant news"", Mr Smith replied: ""I would just like to place on record an apology to Seema Misra and family because of the way this has been perceived and portrayed subsequently. ""Looking at it through their eyes rather than through mine you can see that it may have caused substantial upset and I really do apologise for that."" Mr Smith said his email to the legal team was ""thank you for all your hard work. It's terrific that you got the result you got and I'm really happy that we have progressed"". ""It's nothing more or less than that,"" he added, but admitted: ""In the benefit of hindsight and looking through the 2024 lens and not the 2010 lens, at best, from Seema's perspective, you can see this is really poorly thought through."" The former managing director said Mrs Misra's conviction, which has since been overturned, was seen as a ""test"" of the Horizon system, which the organisation believed was ""tamper proof"". Mr Smith denied having knowledge of a Horizon bug before the trial of the subpostmistress in 2010, and said he was ""shocked and frankly appalled"" at claims the Post Office knew of faults in the IT system while prosecuting Mrs Misra. Mr Smith also rejected claims that an investigation commissioned - known as the Ismay report - into the computer system's integrity was a cover up. The essence of the report, produced by Rod Ismay who worked in finance at the Post Office in 2010, was that there were no fundamental problems with Horizon. In May last year, Mr Ismay told the inquiry he agreed with the suggestion he was asked to ""present one side of the coin"", rather than carry out a full investigation. Mr Smith denied the report was intended as a ""counter-argument"" to allegations against Horizon, but accepted in his witness statement that in hindsight he should have commissioned a full, independent probe. ""At the time we were repeatedly given reassurance that the system was robust,"" said Mr Smith. Former Post Office chairman Sir Michael Hodgkinson also apologised to sub-postmasters on Thursday. Sir Michael, who was chairman from 2003 to 2007 admitted to the inquiry he ""didn't do anything"" to check if the business was prosecuting its own people properly.",7 days ago,business
118,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68790002,Greece offers hotel vouchers to wildfire evacuees,"Holidaymakers who were evacuated from Rhodes last year due to wildfires will be offered vouchers for money off hotel stays, the Greek government has said. The Rodos Week scheme is for holidaymakers who were evacuated from hotels in July 2023, but will not cover those who stayed in AirBnBs. The vouchers will be worth up to €500 (£430) and the stay must be for seven nights. Thousands of UK holidaymakers were flown home due to the fires last year. Holidaymakers are being offered vouchers for two periods: in the spring between 10 April and 31 May, and in the autumn between 1 October and 15 November. The value of the vouchers offered will depend on the original booking that was cut short. For example, if people were staying in a three-star hotel in up to a triple room they would get vouchers worth €300. Holidaymakers will have to book for at least seven nights, with six of them consecutive. The Greek Ministry of Tourism has been putting together a list of affected holidaymakers using data provided by hotels in Greece and tour operators. Those who are on the list should already have been sent an email to complete their registration. If affected holidaymakers have not been contacted, they will be able to apply for vouchers. The deadline for applications for vouchers for the spring has already passed, but it will be possible to make an application for the autumn. Last summer, a heatwave in Greece saw temperatures exceed 40C (104F) across the country. Fires, fanned by strong winds, raged on Rhodes, and also affected Corfu. At the time, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said there was ""no magic defence"" considering ""what the entire planet is facing, especially the Mediterranean, which is a hotspot for climate change"".

119,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68786782,Fake UK stamps blamed on Chinese-made counterfeits,"Fake stamps circulating in the UK are originating from China, a senior MP has told the BBC. Reports suggest a rise in complaints that stamps bought from legitimate stores are being deemed counterfeit. Anyone who receives a letter with a fake stamp is charged £5 by Royal Mail. Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast: ""China is behind it."" A Royal Mail spokesman said: ""We are working hard to remove counterfeit stamps from circulation."" Consumers are being warned to look out for strange perforations around the edge of a stamp, a shine to the surface or the colour looking off. An investigation by the Daily Telegraph found that four Chinese companies had offered to print up to one million counterfeit stamps a week, with each stamp being sold for as little as 4p each before being sent to the UK. The fakes have been found for sale on various websites, the paper said, and they were also bought by small retailers who did not realise they were counterfeit. Alan Mendoza, from think tank the Henry Jackson Society, told BBC Breakfast: ""We don't know the extent on whether the Chinese government are involved - but what we do know is that Chinese firms are involved."" Business Minister Kevin Hollinrake said: ""It is key to prevent counterfeit stamps entering our supply chain in the UK. ""The Royal Mail must do everything possible to prevent counterfeits entering our circulation and must establish where they are coming from and how they are entering our marketplace."" Christine told the BBC's Watchdog that she had bought eight stamps from the Post Office based inside her local convenience store ""I sent one to my son, and he sent me a message later in the month saying thank you, but unfortunately there was a £5 demand on the envelope,"" she said. Another card sent to a friend's granddaughter also led to a £5 fee. ""Because it was two of them that made me quite indignant,"" Christine said. However, the chance of getting a counterfeit stamp is low, Royal Mail's director of external affairs and policy, David Gold, told Watchdog. ""People should understand that the overwhelming majority of stamps on sale are legitimate,"" he said. ""The number of [counterfeit] stamps that we are spotting account for less than 0.1% of the total stamps going through the network."" Barcoded stamps were introduced in 2022 to cut down on the sale of fakes and Mr Gold said this had reduced the number of counterfeits by 90%. However, he admitted that even he struggled to spot a fake. ""The reality is counterfeiters now are so good at what they do that even I... can't tell the difference just by looking at them."" A Royal Mail spokesman said: ""We regularly monitor online marketplaces to detect suspicious activity, such as sales of heavily discounted stamps and work closely with retailers and law enforcement agencies to identify those who produce counterfeit stamps.""

120,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68675348,UK passport: How much does it cost to get or renew and what is the 10-year rule?,"The price of a getting or renewing a UK passport has risen for the second time in 14 months. Meanwhile, UK holidaymakers travelling to the EU are being warned not to get caught out by the ""10-year rule"". It now costs £88.50 to get, renew or replace your passport if you apply online , up from £82.50, or £100 for a postal application, up from £93. An online application for a child's passport costs £57.50, up from £53.50, or £69 via post, up from £64. It costs more if you apply from abroad, or if you require a passport urgently. Passports are free for people born on or before 2 September 1929. The increased fees apply to both new passport applications and renewals. You must renew your passport before you travel if either: How much time you need on your passport depends on where you are going. You can check entry requirements for individual countries on the UK government's website. You can renew online at HM Passport Office or by filling in a paper application from certain Post Offices. You'll need your old passport and any valid passports you hold from a different country. For online applications, you'll also need a digital photo that meets specific requirements. For paper applications, you need two identical printed photos. The rules are different if you are renewing a passport for a child , your passport has been lost, stolen or damaged , or you need to change your name or personal details . It should take up to three weeks to renew a passport in the UK, but it can take longer during periods of high demand, such as before school holidays. To get a passport issued urgently in the UK, you can book an appointment at your nearest passport office , subject to availability. It then takes up to a week to be issued. You can get more information on the Passport Office website or you can call the helpline on 0300 222 0000. The line is open 08:00 to 20:00, Monday to Friday, and 09:00 to 17:30 on Saturday, Sunday and UK bank holidays. Some British holidaymakers have been turned away at the airport because their passports are not valid for EU travel. UK travellers used to be able to carry up to nine months left on an old passport over to a new one. This meant that a passport could be valid for more than 10 years. But the rules changed after Brexit, and the majority of EU countries no longer accept British passports that were issued more than 10 years before the date of travel.  This is known as the ""10-year rule"". To enter those countries now, your UK passport must: If your passport does not meet these requirements, you will be refused entry. The rules apply in all 27 EU countries, except Ireland, which has its own separate travel arrangements with the UK. They also apply to passengers traveling to Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - which are part of the European Economic Area (EEA) - and Switzerland.",7 days ago,business
121,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68781482,US inflation jumps as fuel and housing costs rise,"Consumer prices in the US rose faster than expected last month, in a sign that the fight to slow inflation has stalled. Prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March, up from 3.2% in February, the US Labor Department said. Higher costs for fuel, housing, dining out and clothing drove the increase. Analysts warned that the lack of progress in curbing price rises will force the US central bank to keep interest rates higher for longer. Higher rates help stabilise prices by making it more expensive to borrow for business expansions and other spending. In theory, that in turn slows the economy, and eases the pressures pushing up prices. The Federal Reserve's key interest rate is now at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%. Forecasters had expected the bank to start lowering borrowing costs this year, reflecting the fact that the inflation rate, which tracks the pace of price rises, has fallen significantly since hitting 9.1% in 2022. But recent economic data, including strong jobs creation figures last week, has raised doubts about how soon those cuts might come. Shares on Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as investors had been betting that rates could soon be cut. Analysts, who once expected rate cuts as soon as March, have been rapidly revising bets, with many now not expecting any until later this summer and some predicting the bank could wait until next year. What the Fed decides to do is likely to shape decisions by central banks around the world, said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Diversified Funds. ""The Fed has got some head scratching to do and if other central banks were waiting for the Fed to move, they have got a conundrum on their hands now,"" he said. Inflation cooled rapidly over 2023 as pandemic-era supply issues healed and the spike in food and energy prices sparked by the war in Ukraine faded, but it still remains higher than the bank's 2% target. An uptick in oil prices in recent months has also pushed energy costs higher, while prices for services show little sign of stabilising. The Labor Department said prices had jumped 0.4% from March to February, the same as in February. Higher petrol and housing costs accounted for more than half the increase. Car insurance, medical care and costs for internet also contributed. So-called core inflation, which is seen by economists as a better indicator of future trends because it does not include more volatile food and energy prices, stood at 3.8%, the same as in February. ""We shouldn't overreact to the jump in headline inflation - which was all about energy,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. But he added: ""The details are not at all reassuring for the Fed.""",7 days ago,business
122,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68768314,How AI is helping to prevent future power cuts,"Amid ever increasing demand for electricity, artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to help prevent power cuts. ""I woke up in the middle of the night very, very cold,"" remembers Aseef Raihan. ""I pulled out my military sleeping bag, and slept in that overnight for warmth. ""In the morning I figured out that the power was definitely not on."" Mr Raihan is describing the scene back in February 2021 when he was stationed in San Antonio, Texas, while serving in the US Air Force. That month the state was blasted by winter storm Uri. As temperatures plummeted to -19C, Texans sought to keep warm, sending the demand for electricity sky high. At the same time, Texas' electricity grid started to unravel. Wind turbines froze over, snow covered solar panels, and a nuclear reactor had to be taken offline as a precaution. With not enough electricity to go around, the power went off for more than 4.5 million homes and businesses, first for hours, and then for days on end. ""Without power, the heating wasn't working at all. And you couldn't use the electric stove or microwave for food,"" recalls Mr Raihan. In the end it took more than two weeks for the Texan power grid to return to normal. The storm revealed the fragility of the systems we take for granted to deliver us electricity around the clock. And while not all countries have winters as severe as they can be in North America, demand for electricity is ever increasing around the world. From charging electric cars, to more homes getting air conditioning installed, we are using more and more power in our daily lives. This comes at the same time as countries are increasingly moving towards renewable sources of energy, which are more variable in the amount of energy they generate. If the wind doesn't blow, and the sun doesn't shine, then electricity production drops. All this led to UK Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho warning last month that the country could face blackouts in the future without new gas powered power stations as ""back up"". Another way to make energy systems more resilient is by adding huge batteries to the grid. The thinking goes that when there is electricity going spare, batteries can charge up, and then release electricity later when there is more demand for power. This is an approach that has been taken in Texas. ""Since the storm we built over five gigawatts of battery storage capacity in Texas in three years, which is really an incredible pace,"" says Dr Michael Webber, professor of energy resources at the University of Texas at Austin. That much energy, he says, is about ""four large nuclear power plants"". However, for such batteries to be really useful, they need to know the best time to charge, and the best time to discharge. That means making complex predictions about how much electricity is going to be needed in the future. ""The main thing that makes the biggest difference is weather and electricity demand,"" says Gavin McCormick, founder of the tech start-up WattTime. His Oakland, California-based company makes AI software that predicts electricity supply and demand in a given area or region. This information can then tell batteries when to charge and discharge. The same information can also be used in homes to help people use mains electricity more cheaply. ""So if you had an electric vehicle that you need to be ready in eight hours, but it only takes two or three hours to charge, what it can do is it can find the five minute periods all night where there's surplus energy, or maybe there's clean energy,"" Mr McCormick says. ""It will charge in little spurts at all the best times and still be ready by morning."" The AI can make these predictions by analysing weather patterns, holiday dates, work schedules, and even when the football is on. ""Everybody gets up and makes a cup of tea at halftime,"" Mr McCormick says. Another company using AI to predict electricity demand is Danish firm Electricity Maps. It focuses its AI on forecasting weather patterns like cloud cover, wind strength, temperature and rainfall. This information is used to better understand how much electricity will be generated from wind turbines or solar panels. ""If you can predict quite accurately in advance how much wind you're going to have in the system, you can plan ahead."" says Olivier Corradi, the company's founder. ""One example is Google, where we're providing them forecasts of how clean the grid is going to be in the next couple of hours. They can use that in their data centres to change the time at which they're consuming electricity "" Read more stories on artificial intelligence AI is also now being used to protect the physical infrastructure that carries electricity to our homes. One company, Buzz Solutions, uses AI to scan through imagery of electricity cables, pylons and substations, identifying signs of damage such as broken parts or rust. The system also identifies when trees and other greenery are growing too close to power lines. Not only can this prevent power outages from damaged lines, but it can also reduce the risk of wildfires, which can be caused from power lines coming into contact with trees as happened in California in recent years. The tech can also spot and automatically report to power firm staff another major cause of power outages - wildlife. ""A lot of times surprisingly, animals get into substations like squirrels and rodents, and they get electrocuted,"" says Buzz Solutions co-founder Vikhyat Chaudhry. ""Their electrocution sometimes leads to a massive explosion at the substation. Our AI that's deployed at substations, one of the things that they're detecting is animal intrusions including raccoons and squirrels.""",7 days ago,business
123,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240404-single-parents-financial-security,"Despite financial gains, some single parents are still in 'panic mode'","Single-parent households are growing rapidly. Some are better off financially than ever. That's not the case for everyone. Single parents are a growing demographic across the world. The US has the most one-parent households of any nation in the world ; more than 10 million, according to 2020 US Census Data, the most recent data available. Close to a quarter of American children live with just one parent. But these ranks are ticking up globally, too. A data analysis by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed the number of sole-parent households was expected to rise across many of its 38 member countries. ""The consistency of the upward trend across these OECD countries is remarkable, with the bulk of projections to 2030 suggesting that numbers are likely to increase by between 22% and 29%,"" the report's authors wrote. The number of sole-parent households in Canada , for instance, has risen steadily throughout the past decade and a half, and the Australia Bureau of Statistics reported in 2021 that single-parent families were the fastest-growing family type in the country . There are a number of drivers, say experts: globally, single parenthood numbers are rising as the divorce rate increases in many nations, particularly in some European and Asian countries. Research points to several other factors, including an altered socioeconomic landscape with increased female labour-market participation, and lessened stigma around single parenthood. And as single parents now make up a large – and growing – share of the labour market, many of these families have seen their financial situations improve to the best point in decades. Yet these gains are not universal – and to support this large group of families across the world, there's still much work to do. Relying on a single income is almost always difficult, but data shows some improvement. In the US, a recent review of Federal Reserve Surveys of Consumer Finances shows that throughout the past three decades, US single parents' income has increased; home ownership and retirement savings have both gone up; and overall net worth for single-parent households has improved at a much faster rate than other Americans'. ""If we're looking strictly at growth, things have come a long way over the past 30 years for single-parent households,"" says Elizabeth Renter, a data analyst at American personal-finance company NerdWallet (and a single mum herself), who used the US Federal Reserve numbers to compile a January report on single-parent finances . Between 1992 and 2022 – the year of the most recent Federal Reserve Survey – she found median annual income in single-parent homes rose by 45%, compared to 27% for American households overall. Homeownership grew from 43% to 50%. The most dramatic numbers concern net worth: while American households overall saw an increase of 89%, the net worth of single-parent households shot up by 189%. Yet the gains are not universal across the country. The Federal Reserve data reflects an enormous swath of Americans. Renter is keenly aware that while the numbers in her report draw a narrative of broad financial improvement, that does not reflect the lived experience of every single parent. ""I think those big aggregated national numbers mask some structural inequality,"" adds Vicki L Bogan , a professor of economics at Duke University's Sanford School of public policy. ""If you look at single-parent households by race, there's some quite different statistics."" For instance, US Census data shows black and American Indian children are most likely to live in single-parent households . And while the poverty rate remains higher than the national average for single parents overall – in 2022, nearly 23% of female single-parent households and 11.5% of male single-parent households lived below the US poverty measure – being black or American Indian raises the odds of living in poverty even more. Nearly one-third of black families and one third of Latinx households headed by a single parent live in poverty. For households headed by a American Indian single-parent the number living in poverty rose to 43%. Twenty-six percent of white single-parent-led households lived at the poverty measure. Outside the US, the growth of single parenthood has had the dual impact of increasing acceptance of ""family diversity"" and, in some places, influencing improved policy, says Catherine Jones , a lecturer in developmental psychopathology at King's College London. ""In parts of Europe, there are amazing childcare facilities and parental leave,"" she says, ""and in Scandinavian countries, you see really positive family policies."" Those social policies are a huge influence on families' financial stability. UCLA researchers looked at more than 370,000 households with children in 45 countries. They found while poverty levels among single parents are high regardless of geography, in nations that provide for maternity leave, poverty was significantly reduced . Other, more direct assistance has an even greater impact. A 2022 paper from researchers at the University of Antwerp concluded ""it is clearly possible to make sure that working single parents have minimally adequate incomes"". Of more than two-dozen countries reviewed , single parents in the half the countries could reach or exceed the poverty threshold, largely thanks to child-benefit packages, such as pandemic-era policies including the UK's Universal Credit and the US's expanded Child Tax Credit , which have now expired. However, in the absence of these programmes as permanent support, and even in nations with the most robust welfare systems, single parents are confronted with higher poverty risks . ""Although things have improved,"" says Jones, ""it's important that attention isn't shifted away from still trying to further improve policies for single parents."" Ultimately, there's still a lot of work to do to improve the financial situations of single parents – an imperative as this group grows. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is what Rense Nieuwenhuis , an associate professor of sociology at Stockholm University's Swedish Institute for Social Research, calls the ""triple bind"". ""Single parents and their families are disproportionally caught between inadequacies in resources, employment and policies,"" he wrote in in a 2018 book he co-edited on the subject. When Crystal King, an HR professional living in Florida, US, decided to become a mother, she knew her growing family would be completely dependent on her income alone. ""I'm a single mom by choice,"" says King. ""I turned 35 and my partner at the time didn't want to have kids. So ultimately, becoming a single mom was my option, and I went full steam ahead, knowing I'd be the only provider."" It's not a decision she regrets, but it is one that's shifted her entire mentality around work and money. Now a mother of two children, aged six and three, King says she saves more aggressively and is more conscious of her liquidity – funnelling less to her 401k retirement account in case she needs to access the savings immediately – and works harder to stand out in her job. ""It makes me work differently,"" she says. ""I hustle every single day to get as much done and create as big an impact as I possibly can. Before kids, you do your work, you chat around with people, you laugh, you go back to doing what you're doing. Now, I have a 'work like every day is your last day' kind of mentality."" More like this: And money worries don't happen in a vacuum; stress often makes the overall experience of parenting harder. That's compounded, says Jones, for single parents, who already deal with higher levels of anxiety than the general population , according to a 2023 survey of 6,000 UK adults from the Mental Health Foundation. ""They're often the sole provider not just in terms of finances, but also in terms of care,"" she says. ""Single parents often feel a huge responsibility for all of the parenting and all of the money. That makes a more challenging environment to parent in, and I think generally the bigger picture is it's not single parenthood, per se; it's factors like financial stress, rather than being a single parent in itself."" The same survey asked what would help alleviate the anxiety: ""41% of anxious single parents said financial security, and a quarter (24%) said help with debt,"" according to the report. And even for single parents in the labour market – a growing demographic – massive economic hurdles still exist for them to find parity with dual-income families. ""Employment is certainly not a guarantee against poverty. At least in the EU, we've seen an increase in the employment of single parents, but hardly a decrease in relative income poverty,"" says Nieuwenhuis. And even making more money doesn't necessarily shift single parents' financial situation ""in an absolute sense"", he adds. ""It might not be enough. In dual-earner societies such as Sweden, as a single earner it's really hard to keep up with those dual earners."" There's an undercurrent of financial anxiety to single parenthood that never goes away, says NerdWallet's Renter, regardless of income. ""Personally, it still affects me,"" she says. ""I think of who I was when my daughter was young, and the fear and anxiety surrounding my personal finances. It's still there, beneath the surface, and that's impacted how I deal with money and how I think about money, even though I'm pretty secure now."" King agrees. While she is happy and comfortable in her current job, she still also worries her situation is hanging by a thread, especially in the current economy. ""When you have a partner's income, it gives you a longer runway to find [a new job] without the situation being critical or devastating. For me, the moment I lose a job, it's panic mode."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",8 days ago,business
124,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036,Post Office scandal explained: What the Horizon saga is all about,"New legislation will clear and compensate sub-postmasters who were the victims of what has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. Hundreds were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software said money was missing from Post Office branch accounts. More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for stealing because of incorrect information from a computer system called Horizon. The Post Office itself took many cases to court, prosecuting 700 people between 1999 and 2015. Another 283 cases were brought by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Many sub-postmasters went to prison for false accounting and theft, and several were financially ruined. In 2017, a group of 555 sub-postmasters took legal action against the Post Office. In 2019, it agreed to pay them £58m in compensation, but much of the money went on legal fees. A draft report uncovered by the BBC showed the Post Office spent £100m fighting the group in court despite knowing its defence was untrue. The Post Office said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on the report. Although campaigners won the right for their cases to be reconsidered, only 95 convictions had been overturned by mid-January 2024. The Criminal Cases Review Commission said the scandal was ""the most widespread miscarriage of justice"" it had seen. The Metropolitan Police is also investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences. Horizon was developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu , for tasks such as accounting and stocktaking. It was introduced by the Post Office in 1999. Sub-postmasters quickly complained about bugs in the system after it falsely reported shortfalls - often for many thousands of pounds - but their concerns were dismissed. The Horizon system is still used by the Post Office, which describes the latest version as ""robust"". A public inquiry began in February 2021 and has heard evidence from Post Office and Fujitsu employees. It resumed on Tuesday 9 April, with campaigner Alan Bates the first to appear. This fifth phase of the inquiry is expected to last several weeks, with former Post Office chief executives Paula Vennells and Adam Crozier set to give evidence. The inquiry will also hear from Lord Arbuthnot, who is a member of the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, as well as several politicians who have overseen the work of the Post Office. Mr Bates was the inspiration for the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January 2024. Days later, the government announced new plans to clear and compensate those affected. Mr Bates told the inquiry that the Post Office has spent 23 years trying to ""discredit and silence"" him. Many former sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses say the scandal ruined their lives. Some used their own money to cover non-existent shortfalls because their contracts said they were responsible for unexplained losses. Many faced bankruptcy or lost their livelihoods. Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death. In January, the government said it would ""swiftly exonerate and compensate"" those affected. New legislation was introduced on 13 March to speed up clearing victims' names and paying compensation. The law, which applies to convictions in England and Wales, is expected to clear most victims by the end of July. Convictions will be automatically quashed if they were: The government said a new scheme will process compensation applications ""as soon as possible"" for those whose convictions are quashed. Affected sub-postmasters will receive an interim payment, or can instead accept a fixed and final offer of £600,000. Downing Street previously said it would work with Scotland and Northern Ireland to ensure people wrongly accused in those nations would also be cleared. Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake previously said the government has budgeted £1bn for compensation. More than 4,000 people were told they are eligible, under three schemes: Prof Chris Hodges, chair of the the independent Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, told the BBC that some individual compensation claims were ""well over £1m"". Former Post Office chief executive Ms Vennells resigned in 2019 over the scandal. In January 2024, she said she would hand back her CBE. In August 2023, current chief executive Nick Read said he would return bonus money awarded for his work on the Horizon inquiry . Fujitsu Europe director Paul Patterson previously told the Post Office inquiry that the firm had a ""moral obligation"" to help fund compensation payments. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has been criticised for refusing to meet Mr Bates when he was postal affairs minister in May 2010. He says he was ""deeply misled by Post Office executives"". The BBC discovered that former Prime Minister David Cameron's government knew the Post Office had dropped a secret investigation that might have helped postmasters prove their innocence. Separately, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch denied claims from former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton that he was told to delay compensation payments to allow the government to ""limp into the [next] election"".",8 days ago,business
125,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68775413,Boeing hit after new whistleblower raises safety concerns,"Boeing is facing new pressure after a whistleblower reported safety concerns over the manufacturing of some of its planes to US regulators. Engineer Sam Salehpour accused Boeing of taking shortcuts in the construction of its 787 and 777 jets. He claimed he was ""threatened with termination"" after raising concerns with bosses. But Boeing said the claims were ""inaccurate"" and added it was confident its planes were safe. ""The issues raised have been subject to rigorous engineering examination under [Federal Aviation Administration] oversight,"" the company said. ""This analysis has validated that these issues do not present any safety concerns and the aircraft will maintain its service life over several decades."" Shares in the plane manufacturer sank almost 2% on Tuesday after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was investigating the claims, and the company reported it had delivered just 83 planes to customers in the first three months of the year - the smallest number since 2021. The whistleblower complaint, which was first reported by the New York Times, is the latest incident to focus attention on the safety of planes made by US-based Boeing, one of the world's two major producers of commercial planes. The company was already facing criminal investigation and other legal troubles, after an unused exit door broke off of one of its smaller 737 Max 9 planes shortly after take-off in January. Passengers escaped serious injury but the incident has plunged the company into crisis, forcing a temporary grounding of dozens of 737 Max 9 planes, drawing regulatory probes and prompting Boeing to dramatically slow production of its planes. The company coming under intense scrutiny again led its chief executive David Calhoun to announce last month that he would step down by the end of the year. On Tuesday, attorneys for engineer Mr Salehpour said Boeing had made decisions for 787 aircraft assembly which placed stress on joints that linked up parts of the body of the jets, an issue affecting more than 1,000 planes. In a whistleblower complaint filed with the FAA in January, he alleged the method could reduce the lifespan of the plane. ""These problems are the direct result of Boeing's decision in recent years to prioritize profits over safety, and a regulator in the FAA that has become too deferential to industry,"" his lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, said in a statement. The attorneys added Mr Salehpour had been transferred to work on the 777 plane after he raised concerns. They said he had soon observed other issues in the assembly of that plane. ""He was threatened with termination, excluded from important meetings, projects, and communication, denied reasonable requests for medical leave,  assigned work outside of his expertise, and effectively declared persona non grata to his colleagues,"" they said. The 787 Dreamliner is a bigger plane than the 737, often used on international flights. It has been flying commercially since 2011, but almost from the start has been the target of quality complaints. Boeing eventually slowed production and stopped deliveries for almost two years, responding to issues that had been raised. The FAA in 2022 cleared Boeing to resume deliveries. The FAA, which has increased its oversight of Boeing since the door plug blowout in January, said in a statement that it encouraged people in the aviation industry to share information. ""We thoroughly investigate all reports,"" the agency said when asked about the report.",10 April 2024,business
126,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68769561,Jamie Dimon: Bank boss warns US interest rates could rise to 8%,"The boss of one of the world's biggest banks has warned US interest rates could climb to 8%. Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, said his bank has prepared for interest rates to jump because of ""persistent inflationary pressures"". Central banks around the world have been busy raising rates in a bid to dampen rising prices. But with US inflation gradually easing, the overwhelming expectation is for the Federal Reserve to cut rates this year. Markets are pricing in two quarter-point rate cuts in 2024. In his annual letter to shareholders, Mr Dimon said that the bank was ready for a ""very broad range"" of rates, from 2% to 8% or even higher, potentially pushed up because of high government spending and the need to curb price rises. Mr Dimon's comments come as US interest rates rest in the range of 5.25% to 5.5% - higher than they have been for more than 20 years. By making borrowing more expensive, higher interest rates encourage saving and reduce borrowing for home purchases and business investments, cooling the economy and easing the pressures pushing up prices. Mr Dimon has long warned that investors may be overly confident in their bet that interest rates will rapidly fall back to lower levels. Last year he suggested rates could hit 7%. ""All of the following factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and possibly higher energy costs,"" Mr Dimon wrote in this year's letter. The US Federal Reserve will make its next decision on which way interest rates will move at the end of the month. The expectation is that it will hold rates at the current level with the first cut potentially coming in June. The European Central Bank is also expected to make its first cut in June. On Tuesday, some analysts questioned, however, whether rate cuts lie in store for the summer in the US. To date, higher borrowing costs have not been the big drag on the US economy that they were expected to be. Though some sectors, such as housing, have slowed sharply, the unemployment rate remains below 4% and businesses, bolstered by government and consumer spending, are still adding jobs at an unexpectedly rapid pace. The latest US inflation figures, are due to be published on Wednesday, with the CPI measure of inflation expected to rise to 3.4% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in February and perhaps making it harder to justify rate cuts. In a speech delivered at Stanford University at the beginning of April, the Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell said: ""If the economy evolves broadly as we expect, most Federal Open Market Committee participants see it as likely to be appropriate to begin lowering the policy rate at some point this year."" Mr Dimon has been chief executive of JPMorgan Chase since the end of 2005. One year later he also became chairman and president of the bank. He is the longest-serving chief executive of a major investment bank. In his letter to shareholders, he also said that he sees the United States as being at a ""pivotal moment"" in the midst of global uncertainty.",9 April 2024,business
127,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240408-menopause-women-job-quits,"Without support, many menopausal workers are quitting their jobs","Menopause-related symptoms can be debilitating. Many workers say they lack employer programmes – and have no choice but to leave their roles. In March 2016, Madhu Kapoor decided to resign from her position in the British government department where she'd worked for 23 years. ""I loved what I did, and I was loyal and committed,"" says the 58-year-old, from north London. ""But I wasn't coping, and I thought the best thing to do was to leave."" The mother-of-two was in her mid-40s when she first began experiencing symptoms of perimenopause. She suffered with night sweats, heart palpitations and migraines that left her feeling weak and lethargic. She struggled to focus at work, and dreaded attending the regular meetings that were part of her job as a recruitment specialist. ""I lost all my confidence. I thought I wasn't good at anything,"" she says. But when she shared how she was feeling with her leadership team, she says she didn't get the reassurance or emotional support she was looking for. About six months after that conversation, she decided to hand in her notice. Though her family was shocked, she felt she had no choice. ""I didn't know who to turn to."" The topic of the menopause is becoming less taboo in some countries, as grassroots campaigns like Menopause Mandate and Let's Talk Menopause help break down stigma and build awareness. Yet its professional impact on women (and anyone who experiences the menopause) remains largely unaddressed, say experts. In a late 2023 survey, UK workplace-healthcare provider SimplyHealth surveyed more than 2,000 working women aged 40 to 60. Twenty-three percent considered resigning due to the impact of the menopause , and 14% are said thy are planning to hand in their notice. Although the survey's sample size is small relative to the seven-million women in the UK workforce in that age bracket, it does support anecdotal evidence from women speaking out publicly about their experiences as a menopausal worker. And if the issue remains unaddressed, it could impact millions of workers who take the same decision to leave. Plus, even for workers who don't leave, the financial toll of sick days, unpaid leave and missed opportunities due to menopause adds up to an astronomical cost. Researchers from the Mayo Clinic estimate women's losses at $1.8bn (£1.43) per year in the US alone . Some employers have seen the dire need to support these mid-career workers – many of whom are in leadership positions – and have introduced menopause-specific support programmes. Yet experts say that change needs to happen faster – or millions more workers like Kapoor may feel they have no alternative but to quit. Nearly eight out of 10 women go through the menopause while they're still at work , according to London's Faculty of Occupational Medicine. Most will experience its onset between the ages of 40 and 58 , with the transition phase in which hormones begin to fluctuate – called ""perimenopause"" – lasting up to eight years. Three quarters of people will experience at least some effects during this time, with night sweats, fatigue, headaches, joint pain and anxiety among the 34 medically recognised symptoms. And for, 25% of people, these symptoms will be debilitating, with a significant impact on their day-to-day lives. Despite how widespread the problem is, workers going through menopause report rarely feeling supported. Recent data from consultancy Korn Ferry showed only 26% of 8,000 women surveyed received help via formal workplace programs or policies ; and in a 2023 survey of 11,000 female union members by UK trade union Unite , four of five women reported their employer provides no support at work for those with menopause symptoms. Many workers not only lack help from formal programmes, but also feel they don't have an open avenue to even broach the subject of the menopause.  Samantha was 40 years old and working as the PR director of a manufacturing company when she first began experiencing fatigue, hot flushes and brain fog at work. At first, it didn't occur to her the symptoms could be a sign of the menopause. The topic only surfaced when she visited the doctor about the frequent, heavy periods that had sapped her energy. Throughout the next two years, the mother of two found it increasingly difficult to manage the demands of her role alongside severe symptoms. Weekly trips from London to New York, regular 05:00 starts and juggling multiple responsibilities took their toll. ""I just couldn't continue at that pace,"" she says. Samantha briefly considered the idea of bringing up the topic with the person designated to handle HR matters at the company, but his age and gender made it feel awkward, she says. When she finally floated the idea of a job share or bringing on an extra person to manage her workload, her CEO declined the ask. Feeling left with no other option, she handed in her notice six months later, and opted to start working as a freelance PR and marketing consultant instead. Tamsen Fadal, a US-based journalist, author and menopause-support advocate, believes the number of women who feel compelled to quit because of the menopause is under-documented and underestimated. ""We have to ask ourselves when women leave the workplace at this age or during this transition, how many are not talking about why,"" she says. ""This is a real issue."" For many people, the topic of menopause remains taboo . Fadal believes people find it particularly difficult to share their struggles and articulate the help they need from employers. ""No-one wanted to talk about it from our mothers to our doctors, so how could employers?"" The threat of ageism makes it even harder for many women to speak out, she adds. ""Going in and articulating our needs is scary. The fear of ageing out of a workplace has not left our minds."" The fact that many leadership teams remain male dominated adds to the decision to keep quiet in the workplace, says Lauren Chrien , a UK-based corporate menopause trainer and professional coach. ""With men still occupying a majority of senior leadership positions in most sectors, there can be a lack of understanding or empathy towards menopause as a critical health issue."" Some companies are working to change, rethinking their benefits suites to help provide better accommodations and programmes for menopausal women. Adobe, Bank of America and Bristol Myers Squibb are among a handful of major global employers now offering menopause-specific benefits , such as access to specialist private medical advice, paid leave and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) covered by health-insurance plans. Smaller companies, too, are beginning to understand the importance of these programmes , and take similar approaches. There's still much more work that needs to be done, however. ""Some workplaces are being proactive in providing support, but others may not believe it's necessary, or don't know where to begin,"" says Fadal. That's why several campaigners, charities and organisations are working to close this gap. The Menopause Workplace Pledge – in which UK employers commit to actively provide menopause support to their staff – has been signed by more than 2,600 employers, including Tesco, the Royal Mail and NHS England since 2011. Last year, US advertising agency TBWA\Chiat\Day partnered with the Menopause Information Pack for Organizations (Mipo) to launch the #HotResignation tag . It called on HR leaders to consider how resignations were connected to the menopause, and provided free toolkits and resources to help them improve retention. More like this: The change from employers can't come fast enough, adds Fadal. ""We have to stop asking women to handle the double threat of [menopause] stigma and ageism , and help them get what they need to help them feel whole, partly through education, and partly through support at work and in the doctor's office."" Like Fadal, many of the leaders pushing for change have experienced the lack of workplace menopause support first-hand. A former senior executive in financial services, Chiren walked away from her high-pressure role when severe menopause symptoms left her feeling like she ""might have dementia"". She'd walk into meetings and feel suddenly unable to get out the right words, her throat tight with anxiety. ""One time, I was holding onto the arms of a chair watching the clock tick down with no clue what that meeting was about,"" she remembers. ""I'd never experienced anything like it before."" Chiren believes greater awareness of potential symptoms in the workplace could've made all the difference. ""I wouldn't be having a conversation with you now if I'd worked with an employer who had had this on the agenda, who had managers who knew what menopause was and were able to open that conversation and signpost me toward help and support,"" she says. In response, Chiren founded Women of a Certain Stage within weeks of handing in her notice, offering coaching, courses and events designed to provide support to women and educate employers. Kapoor, too, now uses her two decades spent in HR and recruitment to provide corporate workshops and training via her platform M for Menopause, plus advice to women navigating the challenges she also faced. ""I'm from a traditional Asian family background,"" she says. We didn't talk about sex, periods or menopause. The reason I do what I do now is for more women to be able to understand what the symptoms could be and increase their knowledge and awareness,"" she says. Had that been the norm eight years ago, says Kapoor, she might still be doing the job she loved. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",9 April 2024,business
128,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68667140,Boom times for US green energy as federal cash flows in,"In February US company LanzaJet, which produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol, announced that it intended to build a second, larger plant on US soil. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was a ""big influence"", says Jimmy Samartzis, its chief executive. The second plant would add to its facility in Soperton, Georgia - the world's first commercial scale ethanol-to-SAF plant. ""We have a global landscape that we are pursuing…[but] we have doubled down on building here in the United States because of the tax credits in the IRA, and because of the overall support system that the US government has put in place."" Signed into law by President Biden in August 2022, the IRA, along with the so-called Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) enacted in November 2021, are intended, amongst other things, to funnel billions of federal dollars into developing clean energy. The aim is to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and incentivise private investment, to encourage the growth of green industries and jobs: a new foundation for the US economy. With a 10-year lifespan, and a cost originally estimated at $391bn (£310bn) but now predicted to reach over $1tn - the final figure is unknown - the IRA offers new and juicer tax credits, as well as loans and loan guarantees for the deployment of emissions reducing technology. The tax credits are available to companies for either domestically producing clean energy, or domestically manufacturing the equipment needed for the energy transition, including electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries. Consumers can also receive tax credits, for example for buying an EV or installing a heat pump. The tax credit for SAF producers like LanzaJet is new in the IRA and, offers between $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF (though it only lasts five years). Complementary is the BIL, which runs for five years and provides direct investment largely in the form of government grants for research and development and capital projects. Under the BIL, about $77bn (£61bn) will go to clean energy technology projects, according to the Brookings Institution which monitors the law . One company to benefit so far is EV battery recycling company Ascend Elements. It has won BIL grants totalling $480m (£380m), which it is matching a similar amount in private investment to build its second commercial facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. ""[The IRA and BIL] are massive investments… larger than the infrastructure related provisions in the New Deal,"" says Adie Tromer from the Brookings. ""There is a clear sense that America has become more serious about transitioning to a cleaner economy."" While rules for some tax credits are still being finalized, tens of billions in actual public spending is flowing into the economy, says Trevor Houser at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, runs the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) to track US clean technology investments. According to recently updated CIM data, in the 2023 fiscal year, the federal government invested approximately $34bn (£27bn) into clean energy, the vast majority through tax credits. The extent to which the policy instruments are so far spurring not just announcements - of which there are plenty - but real extra private investment is harder to know: clean energy investment has been on a general upward trend anyway and the IRA hasn't been around long. But experts believe it is rising. Total clean energy investment in the US in the 2023 calendar year including from both private and government sources reached a record $239bn (£190bn), up 38% from 2022 according to the CIM data. Clean energy investment in the US, as a share of total private investment, rose from 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The IRA has had two main positive effects thus far, says Mr Houser. It has ""supercharged"" private investment in more mature technologies which were already growing very rapidly like solar, EVs and batteries. It has also, combined with the BIL, led to a ""dramatic growth"" in investment in emerging climate technologies like clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide capture and removal and SAF. While the total magnitude of those investments are still relatively small compared to the more mature technologies, ""the IRA fundamentally changed the economics"" says Mr Houser. But the IRA is failing to reach some parts of the green economy: so far it hasn't lifted investment in more mature technologies which have been falling like wind and heat pumps, though Mr Houser notes things may have fallen further without the IRA. On the industry's mind is the fate of the laws, particularly the longer-to-run IRA, should there be a change of government in the US November elections. Repealing or amending the IRA (or BIL) would require Republican control of the Presidency, Senate and House - though wholesale repeal would likely face meaningful opposition from within. The rub is many of the projects that the IRA is incentivising are being or will be built in Republican states or counties. Yet a Republican president alone could potentially frustrate things for example by slowing or deferring loans or grants, or amending the rules which serve the laws. ""A Trump presidency would definitely chill the atmosphere and possibly more,"" says Ashur Nissan of Kaya Partners, a climate policy advice firm. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank and purveyor of hard-right ideas for the next conservative President, advocates repeal for both the IRA and BIL. For the organization's Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former Trump administration official, it is fiscally irresponsible for the US, with its vast deficit and debt, to be spending like this. It is also time, she says, that renewable energy such as solar and wind, into which subsidies have been poured for years, stood on their own feet. Yet others argue the US can't afford not to take this path. And the point of the loans program is to take risks to help unlock new solutions that scale. ""It would be failing if there weren't any so called 'failures' within it,"" says Richard Youngman, of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm. More technology of business Meanwhile, the US's approach is putting competitive pressure on Europe to do more. Some European clean energy manufacturing companies are now building facilities in the US to take advantage of the tax credits that otherwise would have been built in Europe including solar panel maker Meyer Burger and electrolyser manufacturers Nel and John Cockerill. ""The US wasn't a market for some of these companies in the past because Europe was more active,"" says Brandon Hurlbut, of Boundary Stone Partners, a clean energy advisory firm. The EU's Net Zero Industrial Act (NZIA) is expected to enter into force this year. It doesn't involve new money, but seeks to coordinate existing financing and introduces domestic favourability for the first time - putting in place a non-binding target for the bloc to locally manufacture 40% of its clean energy equipment needs by 2030. In the UK, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has made clear he isn't interested, nor can the UK afford to copy the IRA's approach in some ""distortive global subsidy race"" and will stick to other ways of helping. The Labour party recently scrapped its $28bn green investment plan seen as a stab at leaning into an IRA style policy. A global audience will be watching as the US's clean energy juggernaut unfolds. And if it leads others to ask what more they can do to produce clean energy products - even if just for reasons of economic opportunity - it will be good for humanity's sake, says Mr Hurlbut.",9 April 2024,business

Eleven stores will close by 19 April, administrators for the brand's owner said, leading to 120 job losses. In addition, 25 head office roles will go, and four stores that had been set to close prior to the administration will shut shortly, affecting 100 posts. The firm behind Ted Baker's UK shops, No Ordinary Designer Label (NODL), hired administrators last month. When it fell into administration, Ted Baker had about 975 employees in the UK and ran 46 shops, plus an e-commerce platform and department store concessions. US firm Authentic Brands Group owns the intellectual property to Ted Baker, with NODL the holding company for the brand in the UK. When NODL fell into administration itself last month, Authentic Brands said the ""damage done"" during a tie-up with another firm was ""too much to overcome"". It said NODL had ""built up a significant level of arrears"" through a partnership with Dutch firm AARC, which ended in January this year. The administrators said the stores scheduled to close ""have no prospect of being returned to profitability, even with material rent reductions"". Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at investment platform AJ Bell said although the Ted Baker brand did ""still chime"" with consumers, ""the sound is dull and for many younger shoppers their engagement is limited to fragrance and underwear"". She suggested Next could be in the running to acquire the fashion chain. ""Next already has a relationship with the brand and no one would be surprised to see it subsume the company into its family, especially now the business has been slimmed down,"" Ms Hewson added. Meanwhile, joint administrator Benji Dymant said: ""Ted Baker is an iconic British brand with strong partners around the world. ""These store closures, whilst with a regrettable impact on valued team members, will improve the performance of the business, as Authentic continues to progress discussions with potential UK and European operating partners for the Ted Baker brand to bring the business back to health."" The 11 stores closing by 19 April are: The four stores that are set to close ""in the coming weeks"" are: Ted Baker began as a menswear brand in Glasgow in 1988, and grew to have shops across the UK and in the United States.

130,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68760215,Jail those responsible for Post Office scandal - minister,"The Post Office minister has told the BBC that those responsible for the Horizon scandal ""should go to jail"". Kevin Hollinrake told a BBC Breakfast audience of sub-postmasters that ""people should be prosecuted"" when evidence is ""established"", and ""people within the Post Office, possibly further afield, should go to jail"". More than 700 people were prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015. To date, just 37 have received full and final compensation settlements. Mr Hollinrake's comments follow those of Alan Bates, whose campaign and battle against the Post Office was dramatised in an ITV mini-series earlier this year. ""People have got to be held accountable,"" the former sub-postmaster previously told the BBC. ""That's got to happen. And we're going to have to carry on campaigning for that to occur."" Mr Bates said the campaign group would ""start looking at prosecutions"" after the public inquiry into the scandal ends, adding that some of the bonuses paid to Post Office bosses over the years should be ""clawed back"". The public inquiry will resume on Tuesday. The latest hearings will last 15 weeks, and witnesses will include key figures at the heart of the scandal - including Mr Bates and former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells. Hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted for theft and false accounting by the Post Office - which is owned by the government - based on a faulty accounting software system called Horizon. Many poured in their own life savings to cover shortfalls in the accounts. The Post Office scandal is widely regarded as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. The government is introducing legislation to overturn the convictions of sub-postmasters linked to Horizon. Mr Hollinrake admitted on Monday that wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were not being compensated quickly enough, and that the process of financial redress needed to be simplified. ""We do need to compensate people, that's the first thing we need to do and we haven't been compensating people quickly enough. We need to accelerate that,"" Mr Hollinrake said on the BBC Breakfast programme, which was broadcast from Fenny Compton, the Warwickshire village where Mr Bates convened the first gathering of sub-postmasters in 2009. There are also three main compensation schemes aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. The Post Office has further details on the scheme on its website . The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments, but MPs have warned that the Post Office is ""not fit"" to run any compensation scheme, that it is removed from involvement, and replaced by a new independent body. Mr Hollinrake told the audience: ""We need to simplify the process is what we need to do. If you've had a conviction then you can go down two routes - the fixed sum award of £600,000 which you get pretty much immediately or the full assessment route [which is] is more complicated, it does take more time. We are keen to make that as streamlined as possible."" David Morley, a former sub-postmaster, said that in 2001: ""I proved in front of Post Office managers and in front of Fujitsu managers that the system was faulty and they did have remote access to postmasters' accounts. Now my question to you sir is do you think evidence of that meeting was deliberately suppressed?"" Mr Hollinrake said he couldn't say if it was deliberately suppressed ""because I wasn't there and wasn't party to the conversations afterwards but someone knew something at a very early stage"". Many Post Office victims who appeared on the programme became emotional when telling their stories. Jess Kaur was a postmistress in Walsall in the West Midlands and suffered a mental breakdown after being wrongly accused in 2009 of stealing £11,000. ""When I was in hospital, the Post Office sent their own doctors to see if I was actually ill. And that's what really hurt the most,"" she recalled. Other former postmasters gasped as she said the Post Office did not believe she was in hospital for having a mental breakdown. Charges against Ms Kaur were dropped in 2011, but she said there had been ""too many broken promises"" for her to know when the final ""win"" would happen for her and others falsely accused. Seema Misra was sent to prison while she was pregnant. She was a sub-postmistress in West Byfleet, Surrey, and was wrongfully accused of stealing £70,000. Although she was cleared in 2021, she said she was ""still fighting on til the proper accountability is done"". On the day she was sentenced it was her son's 10th birthday. ""We did not know what to say to him. We told him because mummy's pregnant she's just gone to a special hospital."" On the morning she was due to go to court, she had said to her son that she would see him later that day. ""Why would someone send me to prison for a crime I never committed?"" she said tearfully. Mark Kelly was a sub-postmaster in Swansea from 2003 to 2006, and came to the BBC studio with his support dog Gizmo who helps keep him calm after the anxiety resulting from being wrongfully accused of false accounting. He said he felt like he wanted to take his own life, and became depressed and isolated. ""Once I started hearing about all the problems which other postmasters were having, like people committing suicide and people going to prison when pregnant, I started to feel quite guilty from it all. I felt like I could have done something more [to help others],"" he said. Lee Castleton was left bankrupt in 2007 after losing a legal battle with the Post Office who falsely accused him of stealing £25,000 from the branch he managed in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. He was played by the actor Will Mellor in ITV's drama about the scandal. ""The journey for all of us has been so painful. We still have to give each other support because it's not over, it's still ongoing,"" Mr Castleton said. He said he still finds it hard to get up each morning. ""I can't believe what we've been through."" BBC Breakfast came live from Fenny Compton, the village where former sub-postmasters held their first meeting, on Monday.

131,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68763232,TSMC wins subsidies to expand US chip manufacturing in Arizona,"Chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has agreed to build a third factory in Arizona, raising its total investment in the United States from $40bn (£32bn) to $65bn (£51bn). The US government has committed $6.6bn in subsidies and $5bn in possible loans to support the plans. The deal is part of an effort to boost semiconductor production in the US. The US is currently highly dependent on Asia, especially Taiwan, for chips. But it has been pushing to expand local supply amid increased tension with China, citing economic and national security risks. In 2022 the country approved more than $50bn in grants to support manufacturing and research for the industry. The Commerce Department has predicted that the investments will expand America's share of production of the most advanced chips from zero to about 20% by 2030. Laurie Locascio, Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology, said the latest support for TSMC marked an ""inflection point... that would restore our nation's leadership in an industry that is foundational to the US and global digital economy"". TSMC, headquartered in Taiwan with a large presence in China, is the world's largest maker of semiconductors with clients including Apple. It announced its first US factory in 2020. That facility is expected to open next year and TSMC said a second fab at the complex would start making chips by 2028. The third facility, announced on Monday, is expected to open by the end of the decade. The Commerce Department said the deal would create at least 6,000 direct high-tech jobs, 20,000 in the construction of factories, and tens of thousands of indirect jobs. TSMC has already pushed back production timelines, because of a shortage of skilled labour and some questions around US government incentives. The investment comes as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wraps up a visit to China, where she has been trying to ease tensions between the two giants, which have flared over issues such as semiconductors and green technologies. Ms Yellen said she thought the relationship had improved, while continuing to voice concerns about Beijing economic policies that were also a focus under former President Donald Trump. She spoke out against Chinese government support for companies making electric cars, solar panels and other projects, though she stopped short of threatening new tariffs. The US currently imposes steep import duties on electric cars made in China, a tax other places, including Europe and the UK, are debating. Chinese officials said that their companies' success was due to strong supply chains and decried the ""escalation of green protectionist measures by some developed economies"", according to Reuters. Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator and senior adjunct fellow at the Pacific Forum, told the BBC that both countries had an interest in ""trying to improve the mood music"" and signalling ""to the rest of the world that the relationship was being managed"". But he said nothing material will have changed as a result of the talks. ""China will continue to believe correctly or incorrectly, that the United States is determined to block its 'peaceful rise', and the United States will continue to believe correctly or incorrectly, that China engages in a host of predatory economic and trade policies, which threaten the rules-based global system,"" he said. ""Those were the perceptions that were entrenched before the meeting started. And when Janet Yellen gets on the plane and flies back to Washington, I'm afraid those perceptions will remain entrenched.""",8 April 2024,business

Mr Tarry will start in September, taking over from Dame Sharon White who said last year that she would be standing down at the end of her term. The partnership, which includes the John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, has come under increasing pressure in recent years. It has closed stores and cut jobs, but recently announced a return to profit. Mr Tarry, who will become only the seventh chairman of John Lewis, said it was a ""great privilege"" to lead the company. Dame Sharon was the first woman to lead John Lewis, but when she announced in October that she would step down after five years in the role , it made her the shortest-serving boss in the partnership's near 100-year history. Her predecessors had each served between 13 and 26 years. Dame Sharon's appointment made her one of the few black women leading a major UK business. However, she faced controversy after considering breaking the historic employee-owned structure of the partnership , and she was also criticised by some for her lack of retail experience. But in an interview with the BBC in June last year , Dame Sharon defended her background, noting that some of her predecessors at John Lewis had also come from outside the retail sector. Rita Clifton, deputy chairman and chair of John Lewis's nomination committee, said: ""The board extends its huge thanks to Sharon for successfully leading the partnership through one of the most testing periods in its history - first Covid and then the cost-of-living crisis. ""She has faced the toughest decisions and overseen the partnership's financial recovery; we are in good financial health with a return to profit, and have a strong balance sheet with record investment planned this year."" Last month, John Lewis reported full-year profits of £56m compared with a £234m loss the year before. Despite this, the partnership said it would not be paying a staff bonus for the second year in a row, which is only the third time it has not paid out such an award since 1953. Dame Sharon said: ""I'm delighted to be handing over to Jason, who has a combination of fantastic retail experience with leadership through transformation."" Mr Tarry had worked at Tesco for more than 33 years, with his most recent role being chief executive of the supermarket's UK and Ireland business. ""The partnership and its brands stand for trust, value, quality and service and it's a great privilege to be succeeding Sharon as the seventh chairman,"" Mr Tarry said. Zoe Mills, retail analyst at GlobalData, said Mr Tarry ""certainly has the experience and knowhow to rejuvenate the John Lewis Partnership"". However, she added that he would face a different challenge to that faced at Tesco, ""with Marks & Spencer, rather than the discounters, a clear threat to John Lewis's long-term success"". M&S is forecast to continue growing its share of clothing and footwear over the next few years, Ms Mills said, while it has also been growing its grocery sales, with Waitrose perceived to be losing out in the battle for premium food. ""Within Waitrose & Partners, Tarry must not lose sight of its more premium proposition,"" Ms Mills said.

Is 75 the new 65?,"People are living longer, and daily life is getting more expensive. It may be time to rethink the timeline for leaving the workforce. Handing in your proverbial badge as a sexagenarian has been the goal for many workers around the world: turning 65 would open a golden portal to retirement. Yet increasingly, the idea of stepping away from the workforce in your 60s doesn't seem realistic – or even sensible – for many people, especially now. Some major financial figureheads agree. In March, investment-management firm BlackRock released its annual letter to the company's investors . Its CEO Larry Fink sounded a warning for workers hoping to retire – comfortably and financially secure – in their 60s. As global life expectancy grows, social safety nets fray and cost of living spikes, Fink warned that retirement at age 65 won't be possible for many, even most, people. ""[Retirement] is a much harder proposition than it was 30 years ago,"" wrote Fink. ""And it'll be a much harder proposition 30 years from now."" From 2000 to 2019, global life expectancy increased from 67 years to 73. By 2050, the UN expects one in six people worldwide will be aged 65 or older. And as the population ages, many countries will soon reach a point where more people are leaving the workforce than are entering it: in the UK, that point may be reached by 2029; in Brazil, by 2035; in India, by 2048; and in the US, by 2053. ""Life expectancy has been continuing to go up since the mid-1850s in the UK,"" says Rebecca Sear , professor of population and health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""But the retirement age hasn't changed that much."" As both the health and economic landscape has changed dramatically, is retirement at 65 an entirely unrealistic goal in a modern world? Not only has the target retirement age not changed in step with modern circumstances, but it's also ""unclear why the mid-60s became such a focal age for retirement"", says Gal Wettstein , senior research economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. In ways, it was a ""rough judgement"" intended to usher people out of the workforce towards the very end of their lives. Yet many government programmes continue to use it as a standard. In the US, Medicare, the federal healthcare insurance program, is currently available only to adults aged 65 and older (there are exceptions for younger people with disabilities). Americans become eligible to receive their full Social Security benefits at age 67, roughly the same age that UK citizens can claim their universal State Pensions. In the mid-20th Century, when many of these programmes were enacted, life expectancy was significantly shorter: in the UK, for instance, it was roughly 66 years for men and 71 years for women. ""If you're basic about it, [UK citizens would] only spend 8% or 10% of their life on a pension,"" says Chris Parry , principal lecturer in finance at Cardiff Metropolitan University. Now, however, ""our lives are getting longer, we're being healthier longer into late middle age and early elderly"", he says. ""There are many people wandering now in their early and mid-80s who are healthy and enjoy a very active life – both physically and mentally."" In short, government stipends weren't designed to support people their in 80s and 90s, and haven't been updated to do so. The policies that were once established to support retired workers for the remainder of their lives are no longer calibrated to modern circumstances. More like this: And while some people supplement their government benefits with investment vehicles intended for retirement savings, many former workers don't have enough – or any – personal savings to fall back on. Plus, as cost of living rises in an inflation economy, any amassed savings simply isn't stretching as far. Additionally, the generational wealth that once ensured younger people would have a financial cushion later in life is becoming a thing of the past. ""Resources have basically flowed down generations, from grandparents to parents to children,"" says Sear. ""Now, we divert resources up to the generations. For the first time in human history, we have wealth flows now going from the parent generation up to the grandparent generation."" This lack of a traditional safety net is necessitating many workers across the globe stay in their jobs beyond 65 to generate enough savings to retire. June 2023 data from American insurance company Northwestern Mutual showed US workers believe the ""magic number"" for retirement savings is nearly $1.3m (£1.03m) – wealth that most people cannot accumulate by their 60s, and doesn't scratch the surface of what a government pension can provide. For BlackRock's Fink, the answer to a comfortable modern retirement involves investing more aggressively beginning at a younger age – and working past the age of 65. Some governments are already recognising 65 as an outdated goal; the UK pension age is already set to rise from 66 to 67 between May 2026 and March 2028; after 2044, it could rise to 68. Some experts, including Parry, agree retirement in one's 60s is now more of a dream than a reality. When it comes to retirement, ""I think 75 is the new 65"", he says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",8 April 2024,business

The Southwest Airlines flight returned safely to Denver International airport at about 08:15 local time (15:15 GMT) after originally departing to Houston. The aircraft had 135 passengers and six crew members on board and rose to about 10,300 feet (3,140m) before landing. The incident comes amid manufacturing and safety concerns at Boeing. Southwest Airlines said its maintenance teams would review the Boeing 737-800 after its cowling, which covers the plane's engine, fell off. The airline confirmed it was responsible for maintenance of such parts. ""We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,"" a statement said. The plane was manufactured in 2015 according to regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, and the 737-800 is an earlier generation of the 737 from the latest Max model. The aircraft in the latest incident was powered by CFM56 engines while the 737 Max models use the CFM-Leap engine. Both are made by a joint venture between General Electric Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines The FAA said the Boeing aircraft was towed to the gate after landing. Boeing declined to comment when approached by BBC News, referring questions to Southwest for information about the airline's plane and fleet operations. Southwest said it would fly passengers on another plane to Houston about three hours behind schedule. Boeing has been under scrutiny following a dramatic mid-air blowout in January, in which passengers on the flight from Portland, Oregon, to California narrowly escaped serious injury. On Friday, it was announced Boeing paid $160m (£126m) to Alaska Air to make up for losses the airline suffered following the emergency. Regulators temporarily grounded nearly 200 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug fell from the Alaska aircraft shortly after take-off. Boeing has been trying to repair its reputation for years after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different version of the 737 Max plane killed 346 people. Its popular 737 Max planes were subsequently grounded globally for more than 18 months.",8 April 2024,business
135,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68452842,Post Office scandal: Bosses earned millions despite Horizon scandal,"How much did the people running the Post Office get paid while the flawed Horizon system was in place? By looking through the company accounts for the Post Office and Royal Mail, the BBC has come up with a figure - £19.4m over 24 years. Before 2012, Royal Mail and the Post Office were part of the same organisation - and its three successive chief executives, John Roberts, Adam Crozier and Dame Moya Greene, made a total of £12.8m. All three of them are due to appear at Horizon Inquiry which resumes on 9 April. From 2012 onwards, the chief executives of the separated Post Office, Paula Vennells then Nick Read, have made a total of £6.5m. That's an average of less than £1m a year - compared to the £3.91m the average boss of Britain's 100 biggest listed companies earned in 2022. It's a huge sum compared to the salary of average workers, or for sub-postmasters still waiting for compensation. The Post Office argues that it is a very large, complex business which has to compete with other organisations for talent, and uses external consultants to advise on executive pay. So who are the Post Office bosses and what did each of them earn? Mr Read, a former captain of Dragoons who had been chief executive of Nisa Retail, joined in September 2019, a few months after 550 sub-postmasters won a dramatic High Court victory. He agreed a much higher base salary than his predecessor, Ms Vennells, earning £415,000 a year compared to her £255,000. However, he has less scope to earn bonuses - and those bonuses have fallen around £500,000 below the maximum he could have made because of the pandemic, the Horizon Inquiry, and the financial performance of the business. As a result has ended up earning slightly less on average than Ms Vennells. He returned £54,000 which was incorrectly paid for helping the Inquiry to finish - it's still ongoing. For 2022/23 he made a bonus of £137,000 out of the maximum £383,210 he might have hoped to earn. In February, it emerged the Post Office had asked government for permission to double his pay. Ms Vennells took over as Post Office managing director in 2010, and stayed in the top job until April 2019. This period saw the prosecution of more than 100 sub-postmasters, a failed mediation scheme, and the sub-postmasters' court case culminating in a victory in the High Court. A part-time Church of England vicar, she became one of the most recognisable faces of the scandal, featuring prominently in the ITV drama Mr Bates vs. the Post Office. Ms Vennells earned £5.1m during her time at the helm of the Post Office, peaking at £718,300 in 2018. That year her base salary was £253,800 and she earned £390,800 in bonuses (plus pensions and other benefits). Through her lawyers, Ms Vennells issued the following statement: ""I remain truly sorry for the suffering caused to sub-postmasters, their families and all those whose lives were torn apart by being... wrongly prosecuted. I continue to fully support and focus on co-operating with the Inquiry."" Mr Crozier became the Royal Mail's chief executive in 2003, following roles as boss of the Football Association and the advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi. He regularly drew headlines for his high salary - he earned as much as £3m in pay and bonuses in 2007-08, raising the ire of unions protesting about the closure of thousands of Post Offices. He made a total of £9.7m in pay and bonuses in his time at Royal Mail, as well as a pension valued at £1.1m in 2008. From 2003 to 2009 the Post Office secured more than 400 convictions in England and Wales using Horizon data, according to evidence released to the Inquiry. At the time the Post Office was part of Royal Mail, but had a separate board which Mr Crozier didn't sit on. He said in a statement: ""While I did not have any involvement in the Horizon issue during my time at Royal Mail, I feel deeply sorry for those whose lives were ruined by what happened."" He left unexpectedly in 2010 to become chief executive of ITV. Canadian Dame Moya took over in July 2010, and earned a total of £1.88m before the Royal Mail formally split with the Post Office. Mr Smith briefly filled in as managing director of the Post Office before Ms Vennells, from April to October 2010, before moving to chief customer officer of Royal Mail. He was the one who greeted the conviction of Seema Misra, the Postmistress from Surrey who was wrongly jailed while pregnant , with the words ""brilliant news,"" according to evidence submitted at the Horizon Inquiry. He was paid £636,000 in 2010-11. Mr Cook was Post Office managing director from 2006 to 2010. He earned a total of £3m in that time, including £1.2m in his final year. He was quoted by his local newspaper, the Milton Keynes Citizen saying he would ""never forgive himself"" for not knowing that hundreds of people were being prosecuted while he was in charge. He said he didn't know there were problems with Horizon until shortly before he left. In 2010, a long-term bonus scheme paid out to a number of Royal Mail bosses, including Mr Cook. That year the Post Office convicted 58 people in England and Wales. Mr Mills, a former HSBC banker who founded the pioneering telephone bank First Direct, joined as Post Office chief executive in 2002. He earned a total of £1.8m in pay and bonuses over four years, peaking at £816,000 in the year he left, 2006, which included £486,000 compensation for loss of office. Mr Roberts, who spent his whole career at the Post Office, was chief executive for six years, a period he described as a ""rollercoaster ride"". His time in office saw the disastrous launch of Horizon and the short-lived rebrand to ""Consignia"". From 1999 to his retirement in 2002 he earned £1.2m. In his last year he earned £225,852 including benefits (with a final-salary pension on top). He and the finance director Jerry Cope both agreed to waive their salary increases for 2001-2, citing the ""perilous state"" of the business. The next year he earned £503,000 which included £119,000 pay in lieu of notice. John Roberts declined to comment.

136,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0w0zrll9qo,How stealth tax hits middle earners with high bills,"Scotland's income tax system has been diverging from the rest of the UK, but the behaviour of top earners is a constraint on pushing further. In common with the rest of the UK, the big tax dragnet is the freezing of thresholds, in which many middle earners are now stealthily caught by higher rate bills. Lower earners were being taken out of paying income tax, but that has been thrown into reverse. By 2027, the UK personal allowance will have the same real value that it did in 2013. Happy new tax year. With the start of 2024-25 from today, you may be paying a third less National Insurance than you faced this time last year. Or you may be paying more - a higher rate of income tax as your pay goes up, and a lot more if you earn more than £75,000 in Scotland during the new financial year. If you own a second home in Scotland, you may be facing a doubling of your council tax bill, unless it's in the council areas of Falkirk, Glasgow or North Ayrshire. And if you run a business from larger premises, you're facing an unwelcome rise in business rates. Retailers are particularly grumpy about that. The National Insurance cut offsets the income tax rise on higher earning Scots, meaning only those earning above £112,000 face a bigger deduction from their payslip than last financial year. But the big increase in tax is the stealthy one, of 'fiscal drag'. A couple of years of high price inflation has resulted in high wage inflation. And as people on low earnings have moved above £12,570, they have found themselves starting to pay income tax. That starter threshold, the only bit of income tax in Scotland which is controlled by the UK government, has barely moved while wages have. The policy last decade, of taking more and more people out of the income tax net, is being reversed, and is likely to take us back to a similar share of workers having to pay income tax. The real value of the starter threshold by 2027 will have returned to its 2013 level. Tax take Another painful threshold is at £43,663. Above that, each additional pound earned is taxed at 42 pence, up from the 21 pence tax take on the pounds below. Called the 'higher rate', this was intended for higher earners, and in 2017, the threshold of £43,000 caught only the top-earning one in every eight taxpayers. While the threshold has gone up by only £663, earnings have risen more steeply. The 'higher rate' (confusingly, it's now the third highest rate in Scotland) now catches more than one in five income tax payers. The Scottish Fiscal Commission estimates that fiscal drag has raised an extra £320m in Scotland in only two years. A similar fiscal drag is being applied by the UK Treasury, with a lower rate and a higher threshold. It is deducting tax at 40 pence in the pound for pay and pensions above £50,270. In the seven years to 2027, the Office for Budget Responsibility reckons that drag effect alone will have dragged £43bn more out of taxpayers. It's a staggeringly big increase in tax take, but one that people are more likely to welcome as it reflects on their earnings going up. Yet that is the element of the tax system that best explains why tax, in all its forms, is taking its biggest bite out of national income since the 1950s. Fat cats At Holyrood, there is pride taken by the Scottish government in having a more progressive income tax system than the rest of the UK. That reflects Scottish values, they say, it's part of a 'social contract' and it helps protect budgets for Scottish public services. At the lower-earning end of the taxpayer spectrum, there is a very modest £23 or so to be gained. From the median full-time income just below £29,000, Scots are paying more in income tax than people on the same earnings are having to pay in the rest of the UK. At £50,000, the tax gap for equal pay is more than £1,500 pounds.  For a police chief superintendent or head teacher on £100,000 per year, the tax bill is £3300 higher than the same salary south of the Border, and for a senior hospital consultant on £130,000 in pay, the gap is above £5,000. Take that up to the fat cat salaries of lawyers and accountants in big global partnerships, and a £700,000 pay package faces a tax deduction £22,000 more than a partner on the same pay in London. Across borders There are not many such earners in Scotland. Only 40,000 people are expected to be paying the top rate of tax next year - 48 pence deducted from each pound of earnings above £125,140. That is only 0.9% of taxpayers in Scotland.  The same threshold for the top 45% tax rate across the rest of the UK is paid by 2% of taxpayers, and last year, they contributed around 39% of all income tax revenue. Those on higher or top rate tax in Scotland paid around 65% of all income tax revenue. That means it's really important that these people continue to pay. But increased divergence of Scottish and UK income tax rates means an increased incentive not to pay the Scottish rate. The same is true across international boundaries, and between the states of the USA, where people can go to the lowest tax places, but often choose not to. What makes Scotland and the rest of the UK different is the ease with which people can move their taxable income between the two. NHS vacancies For those who own businesses, they can take dividends in place of salary. Tax on dividends is paid to the UK Treasury, at UK rates. There is an incentive to put more money into pension funds to avoid income tax. People can leave Scotland and wealthy people can locate themselves elsewhere for more than half the year. But probably more significant is the recruitment of people into high-paying Scottish jobs. A top hospital consultant can look for a similar salary in Scotland and England, but with a tax bill in Scotland that is £5000 higher. That's a disincentive for filling vacancies in NHS Scotland. Is there a reliable measure of how these 'behavioural effects' reduce tax revenue in response to relatively high tax rates? No, it's hard to estimate. But the Scottish Fiscal Commission has the task of doing so, to set the parameters for Scottish government budgets. It says the increase at the top levels of income tax in the new financial year would bring the Scottish government a gain of around £200m, if there were no such 'behavioural effects'. But when people have adapted to the diverging tax rates, that gain is forecast at only £82m. The tax system may be more progressive and that may be politically astute, but that estimate of £118m revenue lost is a measure of the diminishing returns from loading tax on to high earners.",6 April 2024,business

138,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68730891,Ibiza locals living in cars as party island sees rents soar,"César Nebrera pours out a cup of coffee he has brewed on a stove in the boot of his car. The old green Kia saloon sits in the shade of a carob tree just off the main road near Ibiza Town. ""I miss the basic things that make life comfortable, like being able to stand up in your own home, being able to cook properly, or even open a drawer and pull out some socks,"" he says. ""Those are the kinds of things that you miss out on when you live in a car."" César's Kia has been his home for the past three years. He works as a chef, but with rental costs on the Spanish island of Ibiza having spiralled, he cannot afford to live in a flat. ""In Ibiza, accommodation is very expensive, and it's getting more and more expensive,"" he says. ""And the cost of renting is completely out of kilter with what you earn. So living like this is an alternative. It's less comfortable, but it allows me to keep living on the island."" Ibiza is one of the four main Mediterranean islands that make up Spain's Balearic Islands. The others are Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera. Many local professionals in Ibiza are living in similarly precarious conditions because of high rental costs. Last year, the IGC, a representative body of the civil guard police force, said that ""three or four"" of its officers were living in vehicles on the island. Other locals have resorted to living in tents, or in extremely basic shared accommodation. Daniel Granda, spokesman for the Sindicato de Inquilinas de Ibiza y Formentera, an organisation that represents local tenants, says such situations are becoming commonplace. ""A lot of people end up in quite miserable conditions, and we're starting to see slums across the island,"" he says. ""Without the possibility of finding accommodation that allows us to live normally, those of us who live on the island have the feeling that we are being pushed off it."" High interest rates and a recent cost-of-living crisis have deterred many Spaniards from buying property, creating an increase in demand for rented accommodation, which has pushed rental costs up. Rental prices across the Balearic Islands have increased by an average of 18% over the past year alone, compared with a 12% average increase nationwide. However, Ibiza's status as a tourism hub situated in a relatively small area has supercharged this phenomenon on the island, leading to much steeper increases, in some cases up to 40 or 50% over the last year alone. Isabel María Pérez, who has searched for affordable accommodation on the island, says that a single room costs between €700 and €1,000 ($760 and $1,086; £600 and £857) per month, while a modest flat can cost around €1,500. Isabel, who works as a cashier in a supermarket, and her partner, who has a job in a five-star hotel, had to move out of their rented apartment when it was sold. Since then, they have been living with Isabel's mother-in-law. Originally from the central Spanish region of Castilla La Mancha, Isabel says that she and her family are now considering moving back to the mainland, purely because of the housing situation. ""The problem in other parts of Spain is that there isn't much work,"" she says. ""Here there's all the work you could want, but there isn't anywhere to live."" Unemployment in Ibiza Town, the island's capital, is at just under 5%, compared to 8% in Madrid or 19% in the Andalusia region's capital Seville. With a population of just 160,000, Ibiza received close to four million tourists last year, a new record, and 84% of its economic activity is linked to tourism, according to the local government. While its hotels, restaurants and clubs provide plenty of employment, a large portion of its housing is only available at short-term tourist rates, and local workers are priced out of the market. The conservative regional government of the Balearic Islands, which came into power last year, has chosen not to implement a housing law approved by the Spanish government in Madrid which seeks to cap rentals in areas of the country where they have soared. Instead, the local authorities mainly attribute the housing problem to homeowners in residential areas of Ibiza who are flouting the law by offering their properties for short-term rental, when local laws state they must rent for at least six months at a time. The local government says that since 2019 it has imposed around €4m euros in fines related to illegal activity in the tourism sector. ""The problem is that you earn much more money renting for days or for weeks than if you rent according to the law,"" says Juan Miguel Costa, head of tourism in Ibiza. He says that regional and municipal authorities need to work together ""to attack that idea of impunity that there has been on the island, that it's very easy to offer an apartment [for tourism] illegally in a residential building, or offer a property as a holiday home without a holiday licence."" Mr Costa also attributes the rental increase to many homes remaining unused throughout the year, because of owners' concerns about possible squatting, further reducing the supply of housing for local workers. An irony of Ibiza's housing crisis is that it is now threatening to undermine the same tourism industry that is so widely blamed for causing the rental rises in the first place. ""Anyone who lives here keeps saying the same thing: something has to give because the prices keep going up,"" says George McBlain, operations director at O Beach, a discotheque and restaurant that employs workers from the island, mainland Spain and abroad. ""Obviously, salaries go up a little bit, but not enough,"" he adds. ""I've got friends here and their rents have jumped up by double in the space of a year. And if that continues, what you're going to see - and it's already happening - is that workers coming to the island are going to pick elsewhere.""",6 April 2024,business
139,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68500022,Child benefit: How much is it worth and how are the rules changing?,"More families can now claim child benefit payments after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the amount you can earn before it starts to be withdrawn. The government says the changes, which came into force on 6 April, will help more than half a million families. You can get child benefit if you're responsible for bringing up a child who is: Only one person can claim child benefit for a child. There is no limit to how many children you can claim for. On 6 April 2024, it rose to: Child benefit is usually paid into a nominated bank account every four weeks. But if you're a single parent or receive certain other benefits, such as universal credit, you can receive the money weekly. You can find out how much child benefit you may be entitled to at the moment by using the government calculator . The rules apply across the whole of the UK. In his 2024 Budget, the chancellor increased the amount you can earn before you start to lose child benefit . Previously, it was taken away entirely when one parent earned more than £60,000. This has been increased to £80,000. It won't start to be reduced until one parent earns more than £60,000 - up from £50,000. Payments are reduced as a result of the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) . The HICBC rules have been criticised for unfairly penalising single parents and families with one high earner . A household where two parents earn £60,000 - with a total household income of £120,000 - can get the full amount. But if a household has one parent who earns just above £60,000, their child benefit will be be reduced, and cut altogether once they earn more than £80,000. In the Budget, Mr Hunt also announced a consultation about letting HMRC collect information about all the adults in the child's house. This would mean that from April 2026, child benefit claims would be based on total household income instead of the highest earner's wage - a move that has been broadly welcomed. You can claim child benefit 48 hours after you've registered a birth, or as soon as a child comes to live with you. If you claim at a later point, payments can be backdated for up to three months. You can claim online , by post or by phone . You need the following documents: Claiming child benefit for a child under the age of 12 means you automatically get National Insurance (NI) credits, which count towards your state pension. These credits can help fill gaps in your NI record if you're not working or if you don't earn enough to pay NI contributions. The government advises that you should still fill in the child benefit claim form, even if you opt out of getting payments, so that you can get NI credits. Doing so also means your child will automatically get an NI number when they turn 16. Otherwise they will have to apply for one. If a family splits up, the amount of child benefit paid depends on how many children there are, and where they live. If you have two children and one stays with each parent, you would both get £25.60 a week for each child. If you share custody of one or more children, only one of you can claim child benefit for them. The eldest will still be entitled to £25.60 and any younger children will get £16.95 each.

However, previous changes to the way tax is calculated mean the amount people pay overall is rising. The starting rate for NI changed from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers on 6 April 2024. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who announced the measure in the Budget, said this was worth about £450 a year to an employee on an average salary of £35,000. Two million self-employed workers also got a cut in the main rate of NI. Contributions on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 have been cut from a rate of 9% to 6%. The government has said that is worth £350 to a self-employed person earning £28,200. NI was also cut at the start of the year. Since 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between £12,571 and £50,270 . They previously paid 12%. The government has said that when combined with the latest cut, a worker on £35,000 will save about £900 a year. For the self-employed, Class 4 NI contributions on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 were already due to be cut from a rate of 9% to 8% in April. They will no longer pay a separate category of NI called Class 2 contributions. The NI rate on income and profits above £50,270 remains at 2%. The government uses National Insurance contributions (NICs) to pay for benefits and help fund the NHS. NI rates apply across the UK. You start paying NI when you turn 16 and earn over £242 a week, or have profits of more than £12,570 a year. It is not paid by people over the state pension age, even if they are working. Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the NI contributions you make across your working life . The government records how many years of contributions you have made. Paying a lower rate of NI does not mean you contribute fewer years. If you do not work, for example because you are a carer or claim benefits, you might be able to receive NI credits instead, which mean you will still qualify for the relevant benefits. You can also make voluntary contributions to plug gaps in your record. Despite the NI cuts in January and April, millions will still pay more tax overall because of changes to the tax thresholds. These are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. These used to rise every year in line with inflation . However, the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance - the amount you can earn every year before you have to pay income tax - have been frozen at £12,570 until 2028. Higher-rate tax will continue to kick in for earnings above £50,270. Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. It will create 3.2 million extra taxpayers by 2028, and 2.6 million more people will pay higher rates, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which conducts independent assessments of the government's economic plans. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancels out the benefits of the NI cuts for some workers . In the upcoming financial year, an average earner will have a tax cut of about £340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between £26,000 and £60,000 will be better off. But by 2027, the average earner would be only £140 better off - and only people earning between £32,000 and £55,000 a year would be better off. Income tax is paid on earnings from employment and profits from self-employment during the tax year, which runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year. Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions, income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. The Basic rate is 20% and is paid on annual earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. The Higher rate is 40%, and is paid on earnings between £50,271 and £125,140. Once you earn more than £100,000, you also start losing your tax-free personal allowance. You lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 that your income goes above £100,000. Anyone earning more than £125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. The additional rate of income tax is 45%, and is paid on all earnings above £125,140 a year. These apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland . In Scotland a new 45% band has taken effect . The top rate has also risen from 47% to 48%. For most families, income tax is the single biggest tax they pay. But for less well-off households, a greater share of family income goes on taxes on spending, known as indirect taxes. For the poorest fifth of households, VAT is the biggest single tax paid. You can look at the amount of tax raised as a proportion of the size of the economy, or GDP . In 2022 - the most recent year for which international comparisons can be made - that figure was 35.3%. That puts the UK right in the middle of the G7 group of big economies. France, Italy and Germany tax more; Canada, Japan and the US tax less. However, overall taxation in the UK is high compared with historical rates. In its assessment of the 2024 Budget, the OBR said the government would collect 37.1p of every pound generated in the economy in 2028-29. That would be the highest level in 80 years.",6 April 2024,business
141,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68738410,Can troubled Thames Water avoid collapse?,"The boat race is not normally that relevant to 16 million people. Watching the socially privileged engage in a time-honoured and exclusive duel on the Thames is not everyone's cup of tea. But this year's contest between Oxford and Cambridge came with a quite literal health warning that will resonate with customers of Thames Water and millions more around the UK used to hearing about the sewage in our rivers and beaches. The boat race crews were given safety advice to avoid swallowing water splashed up from the Thames. After the race, the Oxford rowers criticised sewage levels in the river. The new boss of Thames Water must also feel like he's up to his neck in excrement, though in his case it is the financial kind. Because Britain's biggest water company is, quite simply, drowning in debt. The immediate red alert is at Thames Water's parent company, Kemble. It is owned by some of the biggest pension and sovereign wealth funds in the world but this week it told its lenders it couldn't pay its debts. Kemble defaulted on interest payments on a £400m loan , and said it doesn't have enough cash to pay back a loan of £190m due at the end of this month. This renders Thames' parent company effectively insolvent. That matters because it was supposed to pump more than £3bn in new money into the company that supplies clean water and removes waste for a quarter of the UK. Last week, Kemble shareholders halted a £500m down-payment on that promised cash injection when regulator Ofwat rejected plans to raise customer bills by 40% above inflation over the next five years. The purpose of Kemble is to inject money into Thames and then eventually receive dividends which can be paid out to owners, which include foreign and domestic pension funds as well as Chinese and Gulf state wealth funds. Given Thames' precarious financial position, current shareholders have not taken any payouts since 2017. Previous owners Australian firm Macquarie took out nearly £3bn in dividends and allowed its debt pile to triple between 2006 and 2017. Kemble's new shareholders have told the BBC they are not prepared to throw more capital at a company that is losing money and they appear to have reconciled themselves to the fact their shares are worth nothing, The amber alert is at Thames Water itself, which is ring-fenced, regulated, £14.7bn in debt and 100%-owned by parent company Kemble. The new boss, Chris Weston, tried to allay fears by saying it had enough in cash and overdraft facilities to keep ticking over till next May, but at some point Thames will need a fresh cash injection. So what next? ""Eventually, possibly,"" the chief executive told the BBC last week . ""But that is a way off yet."" The Treasury, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Ofwat have been wargaming a situation in which Thames is put into a Special Administration Regime, which would see financial consultants run the company on the government's behalf. When energy company Bulb went bust in 2021 and was placed under special administration, consultants at Teneo were hired. The same firm has reportedly been approached by Thames. But what would that mean for Thames customers and/or taxpayers? Thames is not making enough money to cover its costs. That means that either bills to customers will have to rise or taxpayers across the UK would have to foot a shortfall that could run into billions if it remains in public ownership beyond next May. That could be a tough sell to voters outside the southeast of England in an election year. A possibility. Throughout this crisis, Ofwat has insisted that Thames Water - despite its eye watering £14.7bn of debt - is a company that generates £2bn a year in inflation-linked income, which might be attractive to someone. However, any potential new owner would have to be prepared to make lower - if any - returns on their investment than the current shareholders, who have been pretty patient having not taken any dividends from the parent company since 2017. Risky. In financial lingo, this is called ""taking a haircut"". Agreeing to reduced debt repayments from one of the UK's most active borrowers from the financial markets may make other water companies see a rise in their borrowing costs, which would make life harder for other utilities who rely on lenders. Just like landlords who pass on higher borrowing costs to their tenants, customers of all water companies could suffer if markets deemed the loans to be more risky and therefore make them more expensive. A likely outcome. The tap will still run, the loo will still flush whatever happens in the short term. All sides have been clear on that. As one person close to the situation said: ""We will be having this same conversation in a year's time"". That might suit the current government, who do not want to oversee the potential failure of a privatised utility in an election year. The challenges facing Thames Water are formidable. In Finsbury Park, north London, the company is replacing pipes laid when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the land above was fields. Today it is operating in - and under - built-up urban areas. One certainty Thames customers can surely bet on is that bills are going to rise.",6 April 2024,business
142,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68740617,McDonald's: Behind the fast-food firm's boycott controversy,"The sudden decision by McDonald's to take over ownership of its branches in Israel has thrust the franchise company Alonyal and its chief executive Omri Padan into the spotlight. McDonald's will buy back all of its Israeli restaurants after global sales slumped due to a boycott of the brand over its perceived support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza. The fast-food giant uses a franchise system which means that individual operators are licensed to run outlets and employ staff. But the broader company came in for criticism after Mr Padan offered free meals to Israeli forces around the start of the Israel-Gaza war on 7 October. A boycott was sparked after Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan issued statements distancing themselves from the firm for what they saw as support of Israel. Mr Padan, however, is not new to controversy related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the 30 years the businessman has been operating restaurants for McDonald's in Israel, he has been at the centre of a number of disputes. In 2013, the Israeli businessman angered Israel's settler movement when he refused calls to open a branch of the fast-food chain in the settlement of Ariel in the occupied West Bank. Mr Padan's company Alonyal was asked to set up a restaurant in a shopping centre but declined, saying the firm had a policy of staying out of the occupied territories. At the time, the firm said the decision had not been co-ordinated with McDonald's headquarters in the US. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Mr Padan is one of the founders of the group Peace Now, which opposes all settlements and views them as obstacles to peace. Peace Now says he is no longer a member of the group, which was founded in 1978. A leader of the Yesha Council, the settlers' umbrella organisation, said at the time that McDonald's had gone from being a for-profit company to one with an ""anti-Israeli political agenda"". Alonyal's decision resurfaced in 2019 when McDonald's won a tender to run a restaurant and hot dog stand at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport. In response, several letters of protest were sent by settlement leaders in the West Bank that called on the finance and transportation ministries, as well as the Israel airport authority, to block the move. Protests were also held outside the fast-food chain's restaurants in Tel Aviv. And on Thursday, it was abruptly announced that Alonyal would sell the sprawling franchise back to the US food giant. The terms of the deal were not disclosed by McDonald's, although a reputation management expert, who has worked on behalf a number of large companies but did not want to speak on the record, said that those outraged by the decision to offer free meals to Israeli forces may be ""angry that this deal makes Mr Padan possibly a very rich man"". They might be pleased though, about the effect the boycott has had. Mr Padan's departure comes after McDonald's said that the Israel-Gaza conflict had ""meaningfully impacted"" performance in some overseas markets in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the unit that includes the Middle East, China and India, sales growth stood at 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 - far below market expectations. At the start of the year, McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski blamed the backlash on ""misinformation"". The boycott was also described as ""disheartening and ill-founded"" by the firm, which relies on thousands of independent businesses to own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world. About 5% are located in the Middle East. The brand management expert said: ""I get it. They are buying back the franchises to regain control but I'm not sure they have."" They also questioned where the company might draw a line: ""Does this mean [McDonald's] will now need to act and offer deals in other areas where reputational damage has been caused?"" On Thursday, McDonald's said that it ""remains committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward."" It also thanked Alonyal for building the brand in Israel, while Mr Padan said: ""We are encouraged by what the future holds.""

The jobless rate fell to 3.8%, as most sectors, including health care, construction and the government added roles, the Labor Department said. It marked another month of stronger-than-expected growth. Economists had forecast job gains of about 200,000. Analysts said the strong figures could delay cuts to US interest rates. The US central bank's key interest rate is currently at the highest level in more than two decades, in a range of 5.25%-5.5%. Analysts have expected the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates this year to avoid a harsh slowdown triggered by high borrowing costs. But a stronger-than-expected economy has raised doubts about how soon those cuts might come. ""The blockbuster 303,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in March supports the Fed's position that the resilience of the economy means it can take its time with rate cuts, which might now not begin until the second half of this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics. The Fed raised interest rates sharply in 2022 to try to slow the economy and ease the pressures that were pushing up prices at the fastest rate in decades. Price inflation in the US has since cooled, dropping to 3.2% in February, without the big jump in unemployment some had feared would follow the rise in borrowing costs. Economists said the labour market has been helped by government spending in areas such as high tech manufacturing and infrastructure. An influx of more than three million immigrants last year has also added to the workforce, which analysts say may be helping to keep a lid on wages, allowing the jobs boom to proceed without reigniting inflation. In March, the average hourly pay was up 4.1% from a year earlier, roughly in line with expectations and near a three-year low. President Joe Biden hailed the latest figures as a ""milestone in America's comeback"". But Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that the strong jobs growth could make returning the inflation rate to the Fed's 2% target difficult. The report signals that ""the economy has plenty of excess energy that may need to be tamed by continued higher rates,"" she said, noting that some analysts are now betting rate cuts will not come until 2025. Higher interest rates in the US have put pressure on economies around the world, as they entice investors to America and away from other countries. ""The Federal Reserve's dashboard still has some warning lights to deal with before signalling the all-clear for cutting,"" she said.",5 April 2024,business

Kemble Water has formally told lenders it failed to meet a deadline to pay interest on £400m of debt due on Tuesday. The water giant has also asked lenders not to take any action as it explores its options. Thames Water's 16 million customers will not be affected. This notification confirms an announcement on 28 March that Kemble would be unable to repay its lenders as interest and principal payments - including a loan repayment of £190m due at the end of April - come up. It has issued a formal notice to its bondholders, but asked them to take ""no creditor action"" in order to enable a ""stable platform"" for negotiations. Companies sell bonds to investors to raise the funds they need, paying the money back over time with a premium. Being in default renders Kemble Water effectively insolvent but that will not affect the underlying utility business that supplies water and waste services to 1 in 4 people in the UK. The company has been engulfed by a crisis which has seen shareholders refuse to pay a £500m lifeline injection that would have shored up its finances, as well as fierce criticism over Thames Water's handling of leaks and sewage treatment. The future of Thames Water has been uncertain since fears emerged that it could collapse last June, with the latest developments raising questions around a potential restructure. The company has been struggling with debts of £14.7bn. But the new boss of Thames Water - and the regulator Ofwat - insist that the company has enough cash and overdraft facilities to see it through to May of next year. While the dominos are falling at the parent company, these will fall short of triggering a collapse. However, at some point Thames Water will need to raise new money. The current shareholders which include UK and Canadian pension funds as well as Chinese and Gulf State investors pulled the planned £500m cash injection when Ofwat rejected proposals to raise customer bills by 40% above inflation by 2030. Kemble, which is funded entirely through dividends paid out by Thames Water, said it expects it will be able to provide a further update in ""the coming weeks"".

The fast food giant was criticised after its Israeli franchise gave away thousands of free meals to Israeli soldiers. McDonald's said it had reached a deal with franchisee Alonyal to return 225 outlets. It said in January the Israel-Hamas war had ""meaningfully impacted"" business. Widespread protests affected sales in the Middle East, Indonesia and France. Alonyal, which is led and owned by chief executive Omri Padan, has operated McDonald's restaurants in Israel for more than 30 years. McDonald's uses a franchise system which means that individual operators are licensed to run outlets and employ staff. The boycott of McDonald's was sparked after Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan issued statements distancing themselves from the firm. Days after the Hamas attacks on Israel last October, and the retaliation by Israel Defense Forces (IDF), McDonald's franchisee said on social media that it had ""donated and continues to donate tens of thousands of meals to IDF units, the police, hospitals, residents around the strip and all rescue forces"". Vocal protests were staged worldwide as the grassroots boycott spread beyond the Middle East. As well as restaurants in the region, McDonald's businesses in France, Indonesia and Malaysia have also been affected. On Thursday, the company said: ""McDonald's remains committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward."" It also thanked Alonyal for building the brand in Israel. Mr Padan said: ""We are encouraged by what the future holds."" The US company said the restaurants, operations and employees in Israel  would be retained ""on equivalent terms"" though the terms of the sale were not revealed. Under Alonyal, McDonald's employs 5,000 people. At the start of the year, McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski blamed the backlash on ""misinformation"" but it hit the firm's financials nonetheless and it missed its first quarterly sales target in nearly four years. The boycott was described as ""disheartening and ill-founded"" by McDonald's. The company relies on thousands of independent businesses to own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world. About 5% are located in the Middle East. ""In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald's is proudly represented by local owner operators,"" Mr Kempczinski said at the time. ""So long as this war is going on... we're not expecting to see any significant improvement [in these markets],"" the McDonald's boss added. The company will be hoping that by taking the Israeli business back ""in house"" it can restore its reputation in the Middle East and meet its key sales targets once more.

The lender said prices dropped by 1% last month, with higher mortgage rates affecting affordability for prospective buyers. The average house price fell by about £2,900 to £288,430. However, Halifax said that house prices were still ahead of where they were last year. Prices were 0.3% higher in March from a year earlier, although that was down from the 1.6% annual increase seen in February. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said the monthly fall in prices between February and March was ""not entirely unexpected particularly in view of the reset the market has been going through since interest rates began to rise sharply in 2022"". ""Despite this house prices have shown surprising resilience in the face of significantly higher borrowing costs,"" she said. “Affordability constraints continue to be a challenge for prospective buyers, while existing homeowners on cheaper fixed-term deals are yet to feel the full effect of higher interest rates."" Halifax's findings echo rival lender Nationwide , which earlier this week also reported a fall in house prices during March. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said rising mortgage rates had ""finally taken a toll on the housing market"". ""Through February we had the price momentum of buyers who’d already agreed cheaper mortgages in January. Now that’s petering out, and prices have fallen,"" she said. UK interest rates hit record lows during the Covid pandemic, but the Bank of England began raising rates at the end of 2021 as it sought to keep control of inflation - the rate at which prices rise. This had a knock-on effect on mortgage rates which also began to increase, making it more expensive to borrow money for buying a house. Mortgage rates peaked last summer and began to fall as expectations grew that the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates this year. This led to a pick-up in activity in the housing market and February saw the highest number of mortgage approvals since September 2022, according to Bank of England data released earlier this week. However, doubts about whether the Bank of England will reduce rates as quickly as some had expected has stalled cuts to mortgage rates, and some lenders have pushed them back up. ""The housing market remains sensitive to the scale and pace of interest rate changes, and with only a modest improvement in affordability on the horizon, this will likely limit the scope for significant house price increases this year,"" said Ms Kinnaird. Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.",5 April 2024,business

Alaska said the money would address profits lost in the first three months of the year and it expected further payouts in the months ahead. Regulators temporarily grounded nearly 200 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug fell from an Alaska Air plane shortly after take-off. Thousands of flights were cancelled. However, a law firm which is representing some of the passengers on the Alaska flight has criticised the move. ""Apparently, Boeing thinks it more urgent and important to pay those whose corporate profits were at stake, but not those whose lives were at stake and nearly lost,"" said Daniel Laurence, a partner at the Stritmatter Firm. Airlines are now contending with delivery delays as Boeing slows production of new planes to try to resolve manufacturing and safety concerns. In February, Ryanair warned that holidaymakers faced paying higher fares because of the delays. United Airlines, which had also warned investors of a financial hit from the grounding, recently asked pilots to volunteer for unpaid leave, due to the delivery changes. In January, Alaska warned of a roughly $150m hit. ""Although we did experience some book away following the accident and 737-9 MAX grounding, February and March both finished above our original pre-grounding expectations,"" the airline said. Boeing did not comment but warned earlier this year that it expected to spend at least $4bn more than expected in the first three months of the year.

It comes as prices of chips have recovered from a post-pandemic slump and demand for artificial intelligence (AI) related products booms. South Korea-based Samsung is the world's largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions. The company is scheduled to release a detailed financial report on 30 April. The technology giant estimated that its operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won ($4.9bn; £3.9bn) in the January-March quarter, 931% higher than the same period in 2023. That beat analysts' expectations of around 5.7 trillion won. Its earnings are expected to be boosted by a rebound in semiconductor prices on the global market after a severe downturn a year earlier. Global memory chip prices are estimated to have risen by around a fifth in the last year. Samsung's semiconductor division is usually the biggest revenue earner for the firm. Demand for semiconductors is also expected to remain strong this year, helped by the boom in AI technologies. The earthquake that hit Taiwan on 3 April may also tighten the global supply of chips, which could allow Samsung to raise prices further. Taiwan is home to several major chipmakers, including TSMC - which is a supplier to Apple and Nvidia. While TSMC has said the earthquake did not have a major impact on its production it saw some disruption to its operations.

""We could see the critical structures, the blood vessels,"" says Dr Matthew Kroh of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. It wasn't long before he had removed the troublesome gall bladder with the help of his robotic assistant. This was one of two dozen or so similar surgeries he and his team have performed in recent months using their high-tech system. ""It allows us to do a very common operation in a less invasive way,"" he says, explaining that fewer incisions are now required for procedures such as this. But there are many other emerging applications that also use carefully manufactured magnets. Permanent magnets, the kind that keep colourful souvenirs stuck to the door of your fridge, might seem a fairly mature, well-established technology. They've been used for centuries, after all. And yet, today, researchers and companies are expending huge efforts on making magnets more powerful and efficient than ever before. This is because, increasingly, magnets are used in all kinds of ascendant technologies - including EV motors and wind turbines. They are, therefore, crucial for electrification. However, magnets are generally made using rare earth elements, the products of dirty mining operations. And, at present, China massively dominates global permanent magnet production, with more than 90% market share . Many argue that we need cleaner and more widely distributed magnet manufacturing facilities. The future, they say, depends on it. ""My job is brilliant,"" says Matthew Swallow, technical product manager for Bunting Magnetics in the UK. ""Nobody else, I don't think, gets involved in so many things."" His firm makes magnets that are used in all kinds of systems - from cochlear implants, to emergency brakes on rollercoasters, including at Alton Towers. Bunting Magnetics has even supplied magnets to Nasa. Mr Swallow says that, even during the past 10 years or so, the availability of higher grade magnets made with the rare earth element neodymium has improved. For such magnets designed to cope with temperatures up to 200C, a grade of N35 used to be the maximum. But now N52 grade versions are commercially available. ""You can literally make the magnet 60% less massive and get the same level of performance,"" explains Mr Swallow. In an electric motor, a magnetic field helps an internal coil to spin . This might be used to drive an axle and turn the wheels of an electric car, for example. Higher grade magnets mean motors that run more efficiently and cars that weigh slightly less overall. The careful addition of a small amount of dysprosium, another rare earth element, is one way to improve a magnet's efficiency. One reason why China dominates global production of these magnets is financial incentives, says Ross Embleton, senior analyst for metals & mining - rare earths at Wood Mackenzie. Rare earth permanent magnet material is subject to a 13% VAT discount on export from the country, and provincial governments give support on energy costs, for example, which also helps buoy up magnet-making facilities. ""It's a really, really challenging industry to compete in if you're outside of China,"" says Mr Embleton. That hasn't stopped some from trying. US firm Niron Magnetics says it has managed to make good quality magnets without rare earths. Instead, they use iron and nitrogen to make iron nitride magnets. This relies on getting the iron nitride to take on a specific crystalline structure, which generates magnetic fields. Chief executive Jonathan Rowntree declines to explain his company's production techniques in detail, but he says Niron has already produced working magnets. The first of these will be used in speakers. Magnetic field strength is measured in terms of teslas, and Niron's magnets are currently at one tesla. Mr Rowntree says it should be possible to make significantly more powerful magnets, up to 2.4 teslas, with iron nitride. Alternatively, recycling magnets would also be much better for the environment compared with making new rare earth magnets from scratch. In the UK, the University of Birmingham has developed a method for extracting rare earth alloys from old electric motors and computer hard drives, for example. A spin out company, HyProMag, has now successfully extracted rare earths using the technology, and aims to begin commercial production of magnets using such material later this year. Meanwhile, US firm Noveon Magnetics says it has developed its own method for magnet recycling. When asked about the process, and the grades of magnets produced, chief commercial officer Peter Afiuny declined to go into details, except to say that a small amount of alloy is mixed with recovered material to achieve the desired result. The whole process is about 40% more efficient than traditional virgin magnet production. It can be difficult to know the quality of an old magnet from a disused consumer electronics device, however, says Mr Embleton. And sometimes magnets are stuck into products with hard epoxy resins, making them tricky to remove. But gradually, as early generations of EV motors and wind turbines reach the end of their lifespans in the coming years, more magnetic material is expected to become available for recycling. ""There's a bit of a delay there waiting for that material to come back again,"" says Mr Embleton. Companies have an opportunity to perfect their recycling processes in the meantime. More technology of business Niron's targeting of the audio speakers market is interesting, says Nicola Morley at the University of Sheffield. ""It means they think they can produce them cheaply - that market has other cheap permanent magnets in it,"" she explains. Within the last decade, the development of magnet technology has really begun to accelerate, adds Prof Morley. And Mr Swallow cites other emerging applications that sound quite sci-fi - including magnets mounted on satellites to scoop up space debris orbiting Earth. Dr Kroh says he is looking forward to even more sophisticated magnets that will make other surgeries less invasive than before. Chest surgery involving the lungs, or endoscopies, for instance, could one day be performed with the help of such technology. ""It's almost limitless,"" he says. ""This is just the beginning.""",5 April 2024,business
151,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68722934,National Insurance cut to kick in but more pay tax,"Workers will see their National Insurance (NI) payments cut from Saturday but frozen thresholds mean many are paying more in income tax. The NI rate is falling from 10% to 8% for 27 million employees across the UK - the second such cut this year. It is worth about £450 a year to an employee on an average salary of £35,000. But a freeze in income levels at which tax is paid until 2028 will leave many with a higher income tax bill. Many benefits are rising in line with prices, and the state pension is also set to increase. But this comes after a slew of household bills became more expensive at the start of the month. So, the financial impact can differ significantly - depending on whether people work, how much they earn, and other personal circumstances. A fixed percentage of the money people earn from their wages is deducted in NI. Since 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. They previously paid 12%. From Saturday, they will be paying 8%. Among those who have welcomed the cut is part-time teacher Beth Langton-Clarke, who said the money could help to pay for a family holiday. ""It has been tough,"" she said. ""But this will make a big difference."" She said the family finances could be improved by about £800 a year as a result of the change. But she said it had come after they had cut back on spending - particularly food - and constantly telling the children they would be going on fewer outings owing to rising costs. ""It would be nice to put some money into savings again. It has been a while,"" she said. For the self-employed, NI contributions on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 are being cut from a rate of 9% to 6%. Pensioners will not benefit from the reduction, because those over state pension age do not pay NI. However, from Monday, the state pension will go up by 8.5%. Some pensioners, and families like the Langton-Clarkes, are not simply receiving a tax boost. That is because of the continued freeze on income tax thresholds - a factor known as fiscal drag. The start of April would normally see the income thresholds at which different bands of tax are paid going up in line with prices. However, government policy means this has not happened with income tax since 2021 and, under current plans, the freeze will continue until 2028. The result is more people paying tax and more people paying higher rates of tax than would otherwise have been the case. Combining the impact of the thresholds freezes and the NI cuts, independent think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that for every £1 given back to workers (including the self-employed) this year by the NI cuts, £1.30 will have been taken away due to the threshold changes between 2021 and 2024, with this rising to £1.90 in 2027. There are winners and losers from the tax changes. The average earner on about £35,000 has benefitted more from the cut in NI than the hit from frozen tax thresholds. However, the very top earners have seen their taxes rise owing to changes in tax policy. Meanwhile, fiscal drag - as well as rising minimum pay rates - mean somebody working 35 hours a week on the minimum wage is now having to pay tax on almost £8,300 of their earnings. Last year it would have been £6,400. Similarly, it is estimated that 1.6 million pensioners will be drawn into paying tax by 2027-28. Scotland has different tax bands to the rest of the UK. A range of benefits received by millions of people, such as universal credit, are rising by 6.7%, in line with the rate of rising prices (as of September). Benefits are fully devolved in Northern Ireland, but changes will be similar to those for the rest of the UK.",5 April 2024,business
152,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68735699,Hard rock band Kiss sells brand and songs for $300m,"The hard rock band Kiss has sold its back catalogue of songs to a Swedish music investor for a figure thought to be upwards of $300m (£237m). Stockholm-based Pophouse Entertainment also bought the group's brand, likeness and intellectual property. The sale marks the band's retirement from live performances on their End of the Road World Tour. Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen have also sold their back catalogues for multi-million dollar figures. Both artists sold to big music houses for $500m (£395m) and $450m (£355m) respectively. Although details of the Kiss deal have not been revealed it is understood to be similar to that of the British band Genesis, but less than the back catalogue sale of Michael Jackson's work ($600m/£474m). However Pophouse will own not just the rights to the music but the entire Kiss brand, including intellectual property sales, which will allow the Swedish firm to generate future AI-generated content. The company, which previously collaborated with Kiss on a digital avatar project in December last year, also produced the Abba Voyage concerts based on a similar principle. Kiss was founded in 1973 by lead singers Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. The opening line-up, which also included Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, became renowned for their iconic face paint. In their 1970s heyday the band produced such hits as Rock and Roll All Nite and God of Thunder. In 1983 they appeared without face paint for the first time and enjoyed something of a resurgence. This was known as their ""unmasking"". They later re-masked in the late 1990s. Kiss have sold some 100 million records over the past 50 years. Speaking to BBC World Business Report, Gene Simmons, widely regarded as the entrepreneurial heart of the band, addressed questions about the scale of monies involved. He declined to put a precise figure on it but teased that it might be ""billions of dollars"" before suggesting that would be a tall and ""unfair"" claim. ""We will be able to pay our rent, but for any amount of money we wouldn't get into bed with the wrong folks,"" he said. ""The best thing about this deal is who we're doing the deal with, about the collaborative nature and about how we've met our newest best friends for the rest of our lives."" Also speaking to the BBC, Per Sundin, CEO of Pophouse, lauded the partnership. ""They have a unique IP in the makeup, in the dresses and the personas, and they have fantastic music, and they have fans all over the world in all the generations,"" he told the BBC. Mr Simmons, who sang and played bass for the band, along with his co-founder and co-lead singer Paul Stanley, will continue to be closely involved with the ongoing development of the brand and AI-generated material that leans into the band's library of work. He characterised the ongoing relationship as that of a mother to her baby. ""A mother sees her child grow up and get married or stuff, but you're never gonna get rid of the mom,"" he said. ""You can't just hand it over to somebody, although we have shared vision."" Kiss are renowned for being prolific marketeers of branded products. Mr Simmons said they had stamped their brand on 5000 products - everything from coffee to condoms and even coffins. To a man who also told the BBC that ""more money is always good,"" is there anything they would not sell? ""Kiss crack is probably not a good idea. No Kiss cigarettes. But the rest of the world is open, why not? Branding makes things fun.""",4 April 2024,business

Some 15.2% of new cars registered in March were battery electric vehicles, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said, down from 16.2% a year earlier. While registrations of electric cars to company fleet buyers increased, sales to individuals fell. Sales of all types of cars - including petrol, diesel and hybrids - rose in March, which is typically the busiest month of the year as new number plates are introduced. The number sold increased by 10.4% to 317,786, the SMMT said. That was the best March performance for five years, although sales remain well below pre-pandemic levels. Sales to fleet buyers - which include businesses such as car rental and taxi companies - jumped by 29.6%. However, sales to private buyers fell 7.7%, which the SMMT said reflected a tough economic backdrop of ""low growth, weak consumer confidence and high interest rates"". The industry body also said the decline in market share for electric vehicles ""underscores the need for government to support consumers"". ""A sluggish private market and shrinking EV market share... show the challenge ahead,"" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive. ""Manufacturers are providing compelling offers, but they can’t single-handedly fund the transition indefinitely."" The SMMT is calling for measures such as halving VAT on electric vehicles and cutting VAT rates at public charging points. Robert Forrester, the chief executive of car dealership group Vertu Motors, told the BBC's Today programme that while there are incentives for companies to buy electric vehicles for their employees as company cars, there are ""no incentives at all in the retail market"". He added that the high cost of electric cars was a deterrent for private buyers, and ""clearly you've got all the issues we've discussed many times about range anxiety and things like that"". A spokesperson for the Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The number of new electric vehicles and plug-ins sold overall is higher than last year, and this is in part thanks to government grants over the past decade, £2bn in investment and ongoing tax incentives. “There are now over a million electric cars on our roads and we continue to help more people to make the switch to electric through schemes such as the £381m Local Electric Vehicle fund to rollout charging infrastructure.” Car manufacturers could face fines if they fail to increase the proportion of zero-emission vehicles sold over the years ahead. Under the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22% of vehicles sold this year must be zero-emission, with the target expected to hit 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Manufacturers that fail to hit the quotas could be fined £15,000 per car.",4 April 2024,business

The installation is set to feature a range of film screenings, live performances and photography focused on the topic of climate change. Reframe: The Director’s Cut was inspired by Planet Summer, at London’s Southbank Centre last summer, with the aim of empowering the next generation of black creatives across the country. The exhibition launches later at Birmingham City University’s STEAMhouse. Leah Moses, 24, a videographer from Wolverhampton, is among the 23 artists from the West Midlands to feature in the exhibition line up. She started her studio, Leah Storm Content, to help businesses promote products and support artists with music videos. With Reframe, she was part of the team behind I Am Your Mother Dismantled, which explores humanity’s relationship with nature, especially water. Ms Moses said: “I wanted to show how humanity is insincere in our attempts to reconnect with mother nature, as we selfishly hold on to systems that are polluting and destroying ocean habitats despite knowing the impact they have.” Attendees will also have the chance to experience Augmented and Virtual Reality technology as well as motion-capture and podcasting.

155,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyrlk261yjko,The seven wonders of Wales' national museum,"You may have several fond memories of the National Museum if you've lived in or visited Cardiff. Many rainy days will have been rescued by wandering around the exhibitions and artwork on display at the museum, ending with an obligatory trip to the gift shop. But questions have been raised about the future of the museum as it struggles for funding . It is home to many fascinating pieces, some more well-known than others. But how well do you know them? In December 1991, a mechanical mother and baby woolly mammoth arrived as part of the mammoths and ice exhibit. The exhibition, which borrowed specimens from across Europe, focused on animals that once lived in Wales. Alongside the two mammoths were a woolly rhinoceros, giant deer, hyena, hippopotamus and a cave bear. The mother and baby model remain one of the most popular displays at the museum today. Four-year-old Lily made national news in 2021 after stumbling across a 220-million-year-old fossil during a trip to the beach. Lily, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, found the footprint at Bendrick’s Bay while walking with her dad. The footprint, which belongs to an unknown herbivorous dinosaur from the Upper Triassic period, was extracted and can now on show for all to see. Just last month, the 1887 self portrait by renowned Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh was unveiled as part of the art of the selfie exhibition. Arguably one of the most prolific selfie takers of his time, Van Gogh painted a total of 35 self portraits during his lifetime. It is believed this was because he couldn’t afford to hire a model. The portrait has been loaned to the museum from Musée D’Orsay in Paris as part of an exchange and can be viewed until 24 January 2025. Do you know what the oldest artefact at the museum is? It’s an iron meteorite from Nambia which is 4.56 billion years old. The meteorite, which weighs 260kg, is part of a collection of 77 meteorites from locations around the world. In 2014, brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan discovered the bones of a 200-million-year-old dinosaur on Lavernock beach, Penarth. The dinosaur, named Dracoraptor hangani after the two brothers, is the Welsh cousin of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The bones of the dinosaur can be found in the museum along with a life-sized reconstruction, created by Bristol-based artist Bob Nicholls. The Jenkins vase began its life as a round Roman altar from Naples in 1489. It was transformed into a vase in the 18th Century and a drawing in the British Museum shows what it looked like before. It is thought that Thomas Jenkins, a painter, banker, and dealer in classical antiquities based in Rome, bought the vase in Naples in 1769. The vase shows the marriage of Paris, son of Priam of Troy, to Helen. A portrait of Sir Thomas Picton was removed from the museum in November 2021 as part of a Reframing Picton project and put in storage. It came at a time of heightened scrutiny of memorials to slave owners. But the portrait was put back on display after the museum commissioned two artworks from Trinidadian artists to accompany the piece, reframing Picton’s legacy and providing a voice to his victims. After gathering one of the greatest art collections of the 20th Century, two sisters ""transformed"" the museum's exhibits by donating 260 pieces of art. Gwendoline and Margaret Davies started collecting artwork in 1908 and gathered a vast array of pieces during their lifetime. When they died in 1951 and 1963 respectively, the two sisters bequeathed their collection to the museum. Some of the most notable works in their collection include Van Gogh’s Rain at Auvers, three of Monet’s waterlilies paintings, Renoir’s La Parisienne, two paintings by Botticelli and five oil paintings by Turner. Monet's 1905 Waterlilies painting is just one of the paintings donated from the sister's collection to the museum. Another piece on display is Botticelli’s Virgin and Child with a pomegranate. Initially, experts dismissed the painting of the Madonna as a copy . In 2019, the BBC Four programme Britain’s Lost Masterpieces confirmed the painting was genuine after they found a small doodle believed to be by Botticelli. After years of doubt, the painting was finally put on display in the museum. The sister's legacy continues through a charity dedicated to providing grants for the arts, education, health, and social causes. Their legacy also lives on inside the walls of the National Museum through the donated art which has, according to the museum, ""completely transformed its art collection in character, quality and range"".",1 day ago,entertainment
156,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68796497,Lucy Rose: Singer couldn't lift her baby after collapsing,"Shortly after giving birth to her first child, singer-songwriter Lucy Rose went to lift her son out of his cot when she collapsed. For what seemed like an eternity, she lay on the floor in agony with her back spasming. Over the coming weeks, the pain only got worse. ""I couldn't pick up my baby, I couldn't push a pram, I couldn't even wash my hair,"" she tells the BBC. If she needed to breastfeed, her husband Will had to lift the baby to her. When her parents persuaded her to go for a walk, she made it 100 yards before stopping and ""begging to go back home"". At her NCT baby group, she asked other mothers if they'd experienced similar back pains. None of them had. Her GP was no help, either. ""Every time I'd go in and it was the same thing,"" she says. ""I'd be yelping in pain, then he'd prod my back and say, 'There's nothing wrong here - back pain is part and parcel of having a baby'. ""It got to the point where I was crying, begging for an MRI and the doctor told me I needed to dial it down and I was being over the top. ""It was really quite distressing."" Eventually, she went to a chiropractor. It was a big mistake. ""They cracked my back and it was the worst pain I've ever experienced,"" she says. ""I was immediately like, 'That can't have been right, I'm going to be sick immediately'."" Looking back, she thinks that might have been the point where several of her vertebrae broke. Rose is telling me this story over a Zoom call from Spain, where she's taking a holiday to gather her strength before the release of her exquisite fifth album, This Ain't The Way You Go Out, on Friday. She's just polished off an ice cream, and sits cross-legged on the floor, using the arm of a sofa to support her back (which is, thankfully, doing much better). The 34-year-old entered the public eye as a backing vocalist for Bombay Bicycle Club, before striking out as a solo artist with albums like Work It Out and Like I Used To, straddling the worlds of acoustic folk and laid-back, adult pop. One of the first artists to take advantage of Spotify's listener data, she noticed she was big in Latin America and, in 2016, travelled there alone, asking fans to book her gigs while staying in their spare rooms. Her 2019 album, No Words Left, got the best reviews of her career. But two years later, housebound with pain, the very thought of music was too much to bear. ""I couldn't listen to anything,"" she says. ""It wasn't a comfort and it wasn't going to help me. I was like, 'Please turn it off'."" After three months of trying to convince doctors that something was wrong, Rose's husband paid for a private MRI scan. The results showed she had broken her back in eight places. She assumed the health service would spring into action... and it did, just not in the way Rose had expected. ""The NHS lawyers got in contact with me first,"" she says. ""They emailed me saying, 'This has been raised as a potential negligence case, and we advise you to get a lawyer'."" ""And I replied, 'Please, I don't want to sue the NHS. I just want to get better.'"" Eventually, they reached an agreement. Rose agreed not to pursue legal action, and the NHS reimbursed the cost of her MRI. Then treatment could begin. She was diagnosed with a rare form of pregnancy-associated osteoporosis (PAO), a condition that weakens the bones and can lead to fractures. After a second scan, Rose was told her bone density was that of a 110-year-old. ""It's quite shocking, isn't it?"" she says. The condition, which is thought to affect just one in 100,000 women, was also severely isolating. ""Every movement made me think of it. Even breathing would make me think of it. But you feel like a broken record when you talk about it all the time. ""After a while you become more and more closed in."" Solace came from a Facebook support group and the Royal Osteoporosis Society, who put Rose in touch with a volunteer called Sarah Driver, who'd had the same condition. ""As soon as I got her number I texted it, and she called me immediately,"" Rose says. ""She said, 'I can't talk now because I'm about to go out for dinner with my family but I promise you, you're going to get better'."" Sarah became Rose's lifeline, researching specialists and recommending treatment options. The pair still speak every day, and will meet for the first time at Rose's upcoming gig at London's Roundhouse. ""She was so integral to me being better, but she didn't even know me,"" Rose says. ""I need to hug this woman, desperately."" The other key to her recovery was her newborn son. ""I felt very unlovable at the time because I was just so sad - but for Otis I could pull a stupid face or shake a rattle and he'd be happy and pleased I was there,"" she recalls. ""So that was a huge driving factor, having this baby that adores you. I was like, 'This is not going to stop me. I am getting better'."" Initially, mum and son just rolled around playing on the floor. Then, as Rose started a gruelling course of hydrotherapy, they'd spend hours floating together in the local pool. By the time he was seven months old, they could clumsily navigate the house together, and often ended up at the piano in her music room. ""Otis is so joyful and his enthusiasm for life is addictive that, when I sat at the piano, I naturally looked for music that would make him feel more of those emotions,"" she recalls. ""And also, babies have such a small attention span that if I held a note for more than two seconds, he'd be like, 'I'm officially bored!'"" That combination of spontaneity and happiness flows through Rose's new album. Inspired by the old school hip-hop and instrumental funk she listened to as her body healed, it's full of brushed breakbeats and choppy chord sequences that allow her beguiling vocals to soar. The recent single Over When It's Over bounces along with jazzy energy; while Could You Help Me is restless and bright, even as Rose sings: "" Now I'm learning how terribly lonely illness is "". The music was developed over a series of jam sessions in her house, then recorded in a two-and-a-half-day blast - ""all freeform, no click track"" - at Paul Weller's studio in Surrey. ""Playing music with my drummer and bass player was the beginning of me having confidence again,"" she says. ""Finally, I wasn't that broken version of myself any more."" Energised, she sent the files to the London-based producer Kwes and asked him to work on the record. Known for his work with progressive R&B stars like Solange Knowles and Sampha, he was surprised, but enthusiastic. One of the highlights of Rose's recovery was waiting for Kwes to email back the works-in-progress as he developed them. ""He just went to town and made everything sound ridiculous,"" she says. Otis even gets a starring role, cooing along playfully to an improvised piano solo called Interlude II. The joy of making the album still radiates off Rose and she's happy to say life has ""mostly"" returned to normal, thanks to a combination of physical therapy and medication. When she looks back, it's hard to believe what she went through. ""It's almost like I blacked out a lot of it. And when I do think back, it's really vividly traumatic. ""I have visions of me trying to get into a hydrotherapy pool, and I could barely get my swimming costume on to start the session. It took me 20 minutes because I could hardly move my body in any capacity. It feels like a different life, entirely."" Even so, she has to be careful not to exacerbate the condition, which will impact her ability to tour. Her bones are so weak that her back muscles have to work harder to keep her upright, making gigs a fatiguing endurance test. But it turns out that Rose has other concerns: Towards the end of our interview, she proudly shows off a thoroughly-developed baby bump. ""It's really exciting, because I thought this would never be possible again,"" she says. ""But through the Facebook group, I learned that women with this condition have gone on to have several children safely, as long as they have the correct treatment."" Her second baby, a girl, is due in June - and Rose can't wait. ""I shouldn't say this, but I'm really hoping for the normal, hard experience. I hope I'm moaning about sleepless nights and doing the laundry and checking poo charts. ""I'll be immensely joyful if those can be my only worries.""",1 day ago,entertainment

Both the Arts Council of Wales and Arts Council England have cut the amount of money they give to WNO. Company bosses said they needed to ""introduce substantial budget efficiencies"". It means proposed performances at The Bristol Hippodrome in February 2025 and Venue Cymru, Llandudno, Conwy county, in May 2025 will not go ahead. The funding received from Arts Council England (ACE) was cut by 35%, which led to WNO performances in Liverpool being cancelled in 2022 , while operas in other English cities went ahead as planned. Earlier this year, WNO’s music director, Tomáš Hanus, sent an open letter to ACE, warning the company would ""struggle to maintain its national opera identity and standards on a budget that is not even sufficient for a small regional theatre, by comparison to other European countries"". The letter, signed by Welsh opera stars Sir Bryn Terfel and Rebecca Evans as well as composer Sir Paul Mealor and conductor Carlo Rizzi, added: ""If our generation fails to protect this treasure, and lets it disappear, it would be hard for future generations to find any justification for it.""

""With the release of this song it feels like we're really getting the ball rolling,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. In a separate post on Instagram , McCartney revealed the track was inspired by a vision he had as a child on a summer's day in Scotland. ""Letting go, I saw my true love and saviour in my mind's eye. Primrose Hill is about getting the ball rolling with me & finding this person,"" he added. Sir Paul offered his fatherly support for the track by sharing it across his social media channels, as well as sending ""lots of love to Sean Ono Lennon who co-wrote the song"". Ono Lennon is the younger son of the late John Lennon and artist Yoko Ono. James is Paul McCartney's son with his late first wife Linda McCartney. The pair's collaboration adds to their numerous solo projects of varying success. Primrose Hill is McCartney's second release this year after returning with Beautiful in February, his first release since 2016. Ono Lennon has a string of solo records to his name, as well as performing with a host of bands including Cibo Matto, The Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger, and The Lennon Claypool Delirium. Sean and James are far from the only famous musical offspring to take the plunge and add to their family's illustrious musical heritage. But doing so can be both a blessing and a curse - particularly amid online hostility to so-called 'nepo-babies' . As Eli Hewson, lead singer of rock band Inhaler and the son of U2's Bono, told The Telegraph : ""For me and for us as a band, we've known that there's going to be doors open - but those doors will shut just as fast as they open if we're not good."" Here are some other famous examples: The collaboration from The Beatles offspring follows the release of the original Fab Four's final farewell song, Now and Then, which topped the charts upon release last year . Its arrival was 45 years in the making, with the first bars written by John Lennon in 1978 and the song finally completed in 2022. All four Beatles featured on the track, which will be the last credited to Lennon, McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.",2 days ago,entertainment

In 2020, documentary-makers Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine put Gen Z politics in the spotlight with their acclaimed film Boys State. Focused on a nationwide US political initiative started in the 1930s, which immerses highschoolers in democratic processes, Boys State followed 1000 teenage boys who gather at a week-long summer camp in Texas to form a mock government . The feature won the prestigious Sundance Grand Jury Documentary Prize. Four years later, with the US on the precipice of an election, Moss and McBaine have returned with a timely follow-up, Girls State. Set in the Midwestern state of Missouri, Girls State examines an equivalent scenario at a girls' camp . In Girls State, 500 teenage girls vie for positions including Governor and seats on the Supreme Court. As they begin to set out their political beliefs and ambitions, the participants grapple with the responsibilities and moral questions that come with wielding political power – as well as coming face-to-face with the limits of political power and the ingrained social structures that dictate those powers. Though Moss and McBaine had covered similar territory with their original film, they say the rampant ""hyperpolarisation"" in the US drove them to make a female-focused follow-up. ""I think in 2018, we were looking for ways to help us understand the polarisation of the country… understand why our country had gotten to the place it was in,"" McBaine tells BBC Culture. ""We were all pretty traumatised by the extreme political situation that we were in – left, right, whatever."" ""Now and then, I think we're all asking ourselves, what is our political future?"" adds Moss. While Boys State was filmed in The Lone Star State, Moss and McBaine chose Missouri for Girls State, because, having a votership that is spread across the political spectrum, it contains so many of the ""contradictions"" that permeate the current US political landscape. There was also a practical reason: for the first time ever, both the state's boys' and girls' camps were occurring on the same campus. ""Missouri is [sometimes] derisively [called] a flyover state [a derogatory name for states in the US people pass by but would never visit], but it actually embodies the same [contrasts as Texas],"" says Moss. ""It has [Republican Senator] Josh Hawley, and it's got Cori Bush, a member of the Squad [a group of progressive Democrats] from St Louis. And it's got everything in between. It's got rural, suburban, it's got these big cities. ""Girls who come from these towns of 300, they've never met a young black woman before."" In the film, argues McBaine, ""you see the awkwardness of that encounter, but you also see the promise of that encounter"". Making Girls State even more timely, weeks after Moss and McBaine began shooting the film in 2022, a leaked US Supreme Court document suggested that the constitutional right to an abortion was about to be overruled. As the Girls State Supreme Court was hearing an abortion case, while participants mulled the implications of the leak, those very rights were being questioned in the real world, in real-time. Giving the film even more relevance, days after filming wrapped, the Supreme Court officially overturned its 1973 Roe v Wade decision. According to Moss, this generation-defining issue weighed heavily during filming. ""I feel like that was everything everywhere, all at once,"" he says, referring to the chaotic atmosphere for camp participants following the leak. ""We've never had a Supreme Court opinion leak, in my lifetime at least… [it felt like] a sword hanging over their heads."" In the documentary, one of the biggest topics is abortion, an issue that remains divisive for many Americans. According to 2022 data from the nonpartisan Pew Research Centre , 61% of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37% think it should be illegal in all or most cases. ""This particular issue, which we know has enormous electoral consequence at the federal and state levels… these young women want to confront it because it [involves] their bodies too,"" says Moss. ""They feel like this is a conversation that's been owned largely by men."" One aspect Moss and McBaine did not anticipate was the nuanced nature of views on political subjects – which were often surprising. That diversity of opinions was reflected in participants such as Emily Worthmore, a conservative and daughter of a pastor, whom, while staunchly against abortion, believes in allowing other women to make their own choices on the matter. ""You have places like Kansas and Ohio where the abortion conversation isn't as cut and dry. So, Emily represented to me a little bit of that vote,"" says Moss. Yet one of the most refreshing elements was that those who disagreed showed compassion and respect. In one key moment, Worthmore and Cecilia Bartin, a liberal activist, have a lively yet civil debate on gun ownership. ""There was a huge willingness to listen, that gave me a lot of optimism,"" says McBaine. ""Teenagers are elastic too. And one of the questions we would ask kids when we were auditioning them was, 'what have you changed your mind about? Are you capable of changing your mind? If so, how did you do that?',"" says Moss. A seat at the table Another major issue Girls State tackles is the lack of female representation in the US government, a problem several participants criticised, and which is illustrated at the start of the film. Photos of the US Congress from 100 years ago, with a single woman surrounded by males, are juxtaposed with eerily similar pictures from subsequent decades, through to 2020, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump are seen in the Cabinet Room, amidst a sea of men. According to the Pew Research Centre , in 2023 women made up 29.9% of US state Senate seats, and 33.7% of state House or Assembly seats, placing the US 71st in the world for female representation in national parliaments for February 2024. It's a problem not lost on Girls State participants. Though topics like abortion, gun violence and climate change are discussed, the documentary includes complaints from the girls that in the early parts of the programme, there is more emphasis on the girls supporting each other, rather than discussing issues and allowing serious and substantive political debates – which is not the case for the boys. The girls ""want to have their voices heard"", says McBaine. Yet an even more systemic issue arises in the film, one that even comes to permeate the very event they are attending. The documentary shows how Worthmore uncovers a $400,000 funding discrepancy between the girls' and boys' state programmes. The girls' programme – with around 500 delegates – is given $200,000 , while the boys' programme of just over 800 delegates receives $600,000. And other disparities are revealed in the film – the girls are given a dress code yet the boys are not, a difference reflected in a speech by Bartin in which she indignantly declares that ""our bodies are policed"". The girls, not the boys, are given a ""buddy system"" where they cannot go anywhere alone – intended for their safety, but in the film several girls openly question this, vent frustration and complain that it is a double standard. And the Boys State governor is sworn in by Missouri Governor Mike Parson, which doesn't happen at Girls State. These differences were one of the most eye-opening aspects for Moss and McBaine. ""The boys are simply treated differently. They are given different opportunities,"" says Moss. ""Why should that be okay?"" Worthmore wrote a piece published on the Missouri Girls State website, in which the Missouri Girls State director Macae Mickens pointed out that the girls' and boys' programmes are funded separately because of the different ways in which they're structured. Brad Lear, director of Missouri Boys State , told Worthmore: ""The American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary are two separate veterans organisations… they are independent organisations."" Missouri Boys State delegates also told Worthmore about inequalities from their perspective – including a Girls State trip to the Missouri State Capitol that the boys were not offered. According to Vox Magazine , ""While there is still a funding gap and other issues occurring within the programme, the girls now share classes and content with the boys and receive free time for sports."" Moss and McBaine hope Girls State will encourage both more female representation in US politics, and more political engagement from Gen Z. ""We have to imagine a healthier politics before we can get there,"" says Moss. ""And I think that the film hopefully offers a corrective to the steady diet of toxicity that we all ingest as a result of some of the dark forces in our current politics. I think these girls are not naive. They're not sentimental. They're very grounded and very realistic about the obstacles they face."" Girls State is streaming on Apple TV+.

The 25 helmets now on display at Worthing Town Hall, West Sussex, will be auctioned off to raise money for The Fire Fighters Charity, West Sussex County Council (WSCC) said. Each helmet has previously been worn by a firefighter attending an incident for West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service (WSFRS). More than 60 designs were submitted by artists for consideration during the project. Assistant chief fire officer Peter Rickard from WSFRS told BBC Radio Sussex: ""Our fire helmets are so important to the role we do. ""You have some good times in them and some challenging times but to see them all transformed into artwork and all the different designs absolutely blows your mind."" Mr Rickard donated his former helmet which he wore during his service at the Croydon tram derailment with the London Fire Brigade. Artist Roger Moore, a former firefighter with the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service, said: "" It's the one thing that protects you through your whole career so it means a hell of a lot and when I was working on this helmet I was thinking about what it went through.” The Fire Fighters Charity, which offers support and rehabilitation for firefighters and their families, says it is ""incredibly excited"" about the exhibition.

161,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68819796,Hannah Gutierrez-Reed: Rust armourer sentenced to 18 months for Halyna Hutchins' death,"Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the movie set weapons handler who loaded a gun for actor Alec Baldwin before it fired and killed a cinematographer has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. The armourer, 26, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March . She was found not guilty of a second charge - tampering with evidence - over the 2021 shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust. The sentence Gutierrez-Reed received is the maximum possible. Mr Baldwin, 65, also faces a manslaughter trial in July. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer, who handed down the sentence on Monday in a New Mexico court, said Gutierrez-Reed's actions constitute a serious, violent offence, committed in a physically violent manner. ""You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon,"" Judge Sommer said, addressing the armourer. ""But for you, Ms Hutchins would be alive. A husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother."" Ms Hutchins, 42, was killed after a gun Mr Baldwin used in a rehearsal fired a live round on the set of the Western in New Mexico. Prosecutors said Gutierrez-Reed had failed to ensure the weapon was only loaded with dummy rounds - fake bullets used to look and sound like real ones. ""This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being,"" prosecutor Kari T Morrissey said during closing arguments in the trial. Gutierrez-Reed was ""negligent"", ""careless"" and ""thoughtless"" when she failed to notice that live bullets had mixed with dummy rounds in a box of ammunition on set, Ms Morrissey told the jurors. One of those bullets was in the firearm that was used by Mr Baldwin, prosecutors said. Jurors deliberated for three hours before returning their verdict in March. Ms Hutchins' parents and her sister said they were ""satisfied"" with the verdict. Their statement added: ""We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna's death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions."" Before she was sentenced, Gutierrez Reed addressed the court, saying that her heart aches for the Hutchins family and friends. ""The jury found me guilty; that does not make me a monster. That makes me human,"" she said through tears. But Judge Sommer said she felt the armourer did not take responsibility for her actions. ""I did not hear you take accountability,"" the judge said. Ms Hutchins' mother and sister also spoke in recorded videos from their native Kyiv, Ukraine. The mother, Olga Solovey, said in a translated video that no one involved in her daughter's death ever reached out to express sympathy. ""It's very important to me that there is justice,"" she said. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Gutierrez-Reed had brought a box of live bullets to the New Mexico film set from her California home. They said these live rounds slowly spread throughout the set over the course of 12 days. Ms Morrissey said she believed the armourer did not intend to bring live rounds to the set, but rather that Ms Hutchins' death was a case of tragic negligence. The prosecutor added that Gutierrez-Reed was more ""worried about her career"" and less about the victims in the aftermath of the shooting. Gutierrez-Reed did not testify in the two-week trial, but her lawyer said in closing arguments that prosecutors had failed to prove his client was the sole person responsible for the fatal shooting. ""The [ammunition] boxes don't matter, because we don't know what was in them three or four days before,"" her lawyer, Jason Bowles told the jury, arguing his client did not know that there were real bullets on set. Mr Bowles also blamed Mr Baldwin, arguing that he had ""gone off-script"" when he pointed the gun at film crew.  ""It was not in the script for Mr Baldwin to point the weapon,"" he said. ""She didn't know that Mr Baldwin was going to do what he did."" Bowles had vowed to appeal the guilty verdict. Gutierrez-Reed was found not guilty of evidence tampering stemming from accusations that she attempted to dispose of a small bag of narcotics after the shooting. Last year, the movie's cast and crew finished filming in tribute to Ms Hutchins, with her husband serving as an executive producer.",2 days ago,entertainment
162,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-64824526,Rust trial: How events unfolded after fatal shooting on Alec Baldwin film set,"Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died on the set of Western film Rust in New Mexico in 2021, after a gun held by Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin fired a live round while he was rehearsing a scene. He has denied pulling the trigger and has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He is expected to go on trial in July. The film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for the weapons on the set, has been jailed after being found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Here is a summary of the events so far. Halyna Hutchins dies and director Joel Souza is injured after Alec Baldwin fires a prop gun on a film set for 19th Century western Rust in New Mexico. Ukrainian-born Hutchins was shot while working as the film's director of photography. The 42-year-old was flown to hospital by helicopter, but died of her injuries. Souza was taken by ambulance from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch. Baldwin, who is also a co-producer of Rust, plays the film's lead and namesake - an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter. The actor, 64, is best-known as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live. Speaking at the time, he said : ""My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna."" He said he was ""fully co-operating with the police investigation"". In his first statement since the on-set shooting, injured director Souza says he is ""gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague"" Hutchins . Hutchins was fatally shot in the chest. Souza, who had been standing behind her, was treated in hospital for a wound to the shoulder, and later discharged. Court submissions show assistant director David Halls did not know the gun contained live ammunition, and indicated it was unloaded by shouting ""cold gun!"" A vigil takes place in New Mexico to mourn Hutchins, with industry professionals among those lighting candles in her memory. Legal documents reveal Alec Baldwin was drawing a revolver across his body and pointing it at a camera during the on-set rehearsal when the gun fired. It is revealed Rust's assistant director, David Halls, had been sacked from a previous production, war drama Freedom's Path, over gun safety violations in 2019. A statement from the producers of that film told news agency AFP that Halls was dismissed after a crew member ""incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged"". Halls could not be reached for comment. There is no suggestion that he was at fault for the Rust incident. Criminal charges may still be filed over the shooting on the set of Rust, police say, a week after the tragedy. Investigators said a ""lead projectile"" had been removed from director Souza's shoulder, and that it appeared to be part of a live round. Sante Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said police had recovered 600 pieces of evidence so far - including three firearms and 500 rounds of ammunition. Baldwin speaks publicly for the first time since the shooting, calling Hutchins ""my friend"". ""The day I arrived in Santa Fe and started shooting I took her [Hutchins] to dinner with Joel,"" he said. ""We were a very, very well-oiled crew shooting a film together, and then this horrible event happened."" He said police had ordered him not to discuss the ongoing investigation, but described the accident as a ""one-in-a-trillion episode"". He tells reporters he would be in favour of limiting the future use of firearms on film productions to protect people's safety. A legal action against Alec Baldwin alleges that the film script did not require him to fire a gun when he fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell - who called police after the shooting on the New Mexico film set - filed the case. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, accused the actor of ""playing Russian roulette"" when he fired the gun without checking it first. Police obtain a further warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier. An affidavit - a written statement of evidence - with the warrant says police were told ammunition for the film had come from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop. The affidavit said the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, had told investigators the live round may have been from some ""reloaded ammunition"". He said the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit. Baldwin admits his acting career may be over, telling George Stephanopoulos of ABC News: ""It could be"", adding that he did not care. He also says he ""didn't pull the trigger"" of the gun during the incident, and adds: ""Someone put a live bullet in a gun. I know it's not me."" Baldwin said that, while he didn't feel guilty, the incident had left him emotionally scarred. According to court records, Halls was given the gun by Gutierrez-Reed. Her lawyers have said she did not know where ""the live rounds came from"". That question lies at the centre of the police investigation. Police obtain a search warrant for Baldwin's phone , issued by a Sante Fe court. The warrant claims ""there may be evidence on the phone"" that could be ""material and relevant to this investigation"". Investigators move to confiscate Baldwin's iPhone to look at text messages, emails, web browser history and other information. Despite obtaining a search warrant more than three weeks earlier, in December, officials say they have been unable to obtain Baldwin's phone. The actor hits back at suggestions he is not complying with the investigation. In a long video message posted to his Instagram page , the actor says ""any suggestion"" he had been deliberately evasive with investigators was a ""lie"". ""They can't just go through your phone and take your photos, or your love letters to your wife, or what have you,"" Mr Baldwin said. ""That is a process that takes time. But of course we are going to comply 1000% with all that."" Gutierrez-Reed sues the prop supplier , alleging his company distributed ""a mix of dummy and live ammunition"" on set. She filed her legal claim in New Mexico state court, and is seeking unspecified damages from Seth Kenney and PDQ Arm and Prop LLC. Kenney has not yet commented. Her claim states: ""The ammunition was misrepresented as only dummy ammunition when it contained both dummy and live ammunition."" But in December, Kenney had told Good Morning America: ""It's not possible that they [the live rounds] came from PDQ or myself personally."" Court documents state Gutierrez-Reed said police discovered seven bullets suspected of being live ammunition after the shooting, according to AFP news agency. The documents said the bullets were distributed among a box of cartridges with other ammunition and cartridge belts, intended for the actors to use as accessories. Baldwin turns over his mobile phone to police investigating the fatal shooting. Hutchins' family brings a lawsuit against Baldwin, assistant director Halls, armourer Gutierrez-Reed and prop master Sarah Zachry. It alleges Baldwin ""recklessly shot and killed"" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust in October 2021. Lawyers for the Hutchins' family say she would still be alive if crew members had not cut corners. The case was filed in the First Judicial District Court of New Mexico on behalf of the cinematographer's husband, Matthew, and son Andros, and seeks unspecified damages. Hutchins' husband says it is ""absurd"" that Baldwin is not taking responsibility for her death. Matthew Hutchins tells NBC's Today: ""I was angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way, and then to not accept responsibility after having just described killing her."" The producers of Rust are fined and strongly criticised by authorities for failing to follow safety guidelines. The makers of the film showed ""plain indifference to recognised hazards associated with use of firearms on set"", according to the New Mexico Environment Department. The agency issues the maximum $136,793 (£105,000) fine to Rust Movie Productions. Police release footage from the set of Rust, including of the aftermath of the fatal shooting . Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza also releases crime scene photos and witness interviews with people including Baldwin. The producers of Rust dispute an official report saying they were indifferent to gun safety before the on-set shooting tragedy. Rust Movie Productions says it ""enforced all applicable safety protocols"". In legal documents filed to contest the official findings, the firm also said it ""did not 'wilfully' violate any safety protocol"". Baldwin reaches a settlement with Hutchins' family . Filming of Rust will continue in January 2023, with her widower Matthew on board as the movie's executive producer. All parties believe Hutchins' death was an accident, her husband said. The exact terms of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, are not disclosed. Heather Brewer, spokesperson for the office of the first judicial district attorney for New Mexico, said the proposed settlement ""will have no impact on District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altweis' ongoing investigation, or her ultimate decision whether to file criminal charges in the case"". Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will each will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter over the shooting of Halyna Hutchins, District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announces. Lawyers for both say they intend to fight the charges in court. Both face up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 (£4,040) fine if convicted. They will be tried by a jury, prosecutors say. Assistant director David Halls entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, prosecutors said. He will spend six months serving probation. Baldwin was on the phone during firearms training for Rust, prosecutors say, as they charge him with involuntary manslaughter . Santa Fe's District Attorney's Office accuse the actor of ""many instances of extremely reckless acts"". ""If Mr Baldwin had performed mandatory safety checks with armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and not pointed the gun at Hutchins, the ""tragedy would not have occurred"", wrote Robert Shilling. He is a special investigator for the district attorney's office, and wrote this in a statement of probable cause filed with the manslaughter charges. Baldwin has previously denied responsibility for the shooting and a representative declined to comment to the BBC. A lawyer for Gutierrez-Reed says she ""will fight these charges"" and blamed Halls for not letting her know that a real gun was to be used in the moment when the fatal shooting occurred. Hutchins' family files a new civil suit against Alec Baldwin and producers involved in Rust. Their lawyer, Gloria Allred, says they were ""devastated by the shocking killing"" and ""feel strongly that anyone who is responsible for her loss must be held accountable"". The case alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, and is being brought in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Hutchins' mother, father and sister, who are living in Ukraine. Filming on Rust is to resume this spring , according to US reports, with Baldwin remaining in the the starring role. It is shifting location to Montana. A mix of new and old crew members will work on the film, with Bianca Cline taking over as cinematographer. Meanwhile Hutchins' widower Matthew has also approved a documentary about his late wife, producers said. The documentary, made ""at [executive producer, Mr] Hutchins' behest, and with his blessing and support"" will explore Ms Hutchins' life and ""final work, including the completion of the film"", a statement said. Rust Movie productions, which Baldwin is part of, have said that the scene which was being rehearsed when Ms Hutchins was shot has now been rewritten, and that the ""any use of working weapons and any form of ammunition"" had been barred from the set. Prosecutors in New Mexico drop firearm enhancement charges against Baldwin , in a move which reduces possible prison time for the actor, as the charges carry a mandatory five-year prison sentence. He still faces up to 18 months in prison under involuntary manslaughter charges. Heather Brewer, Santa Fe county district attorney spokesperson, said the prosecution dropped the firearm enhancement charge to ""avoid further litigious distractions by Mr Baldwin and his attorneys"". According to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, prosecutors also dropped the firearm enhancement charge for Gutierrez-Reed. Lawyers for Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed had been arguing against the firearm enhancement charge, saying prosecutors were applying a version of the law passed after the October 2021 shooting accident. Baldwin pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter for the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust. He entered his plea online and also waived his right to an upcoming virtual court hearing. Gutierrez-Reed is also accused of involuntary manslaughter; prosecutors say she failed to ensure that dummy bullets were loaded into the gun that killed Hutchins. Criminal charges are dropped against Alec Baldwin over the fatal on-set shooting. A statement, released by New Mexico special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis, said that ""over the last few days... new facts were revealed"" in the case, requiring further investigation. ""This decision does not absolve Mr Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,"" the statement continued, adding: ""Our follow-up investigation will remain active and ongoing."" A lawyer for Mr Baldwin praised the move by prosecutors, saying: ""We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident."" The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is still facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter, and there will be a preliminary hearing on 3 May. On the same day, filming and principal photography for Rust resumed in Montana. The family of Halyna Hutchins said they will sue Alec Baldwin despite his criminal charges being dropped. A lawyer for Ms Hutchins' parents and sister said that the actor ""cannot escape responsibility"" for her death. Mr Baldwin had already reached a deal with her widower and 10-year-old son. A judge approved a settlement agreement for the family of Halyna Hutchins. Lawyers representing Ms Hutchins' husband Matthew and their son Andros sued Baldwin and the film's other producers for wrongful death in 2022. An undisclosed settlement was agreed later the same year. On Thursday, US judge Bryan Biedscheid approved that agreement, which will see youngster Andros receive ""periodic payments"" when he reaches the ages of 18 and 22. The order stated that the settlement was ""fair, appropriate, and in the best interests of Andros Hutchins, a minor, protected person"". Matthew Hutchins, as part of the settlement, will also become an executive producer on Rust - the western film which recently resumed filming in Montana. A weapons supervisor on the set of Alec Baldwin's film Rust was likely hungover on the day a cinematographer was fatally shot, prosecutors alleged. They accused Hannah Gutierrez-Reed of drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in the evenings during filming. In response, her lawyer said prosecutors had mishandled the case and resorted to ""character assassination"". Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armourer and weapons supervisor on Rust pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering charges. Prosecutors say Ms Gutierrez-Reed acted recklessly when loading the gun. They said she failed to ensure that dummy bullets were loaded into the weapon that killed Ms Hutchins, and that the armourer handed the gun to Baldwin, having not checked that all the bullets were dummies. Ms Gutierrez-Reed denies this. A new report appeared to cast doubt over Mr Baldwin's accounts of events. He repeatedly denied pulling the trigger of the prop gun which went off, killing Ms Hutchins. But weapons experts said the trigger would have ""had to be pulled"". A grand jury in New Mexico charged Alec Baldwin with a fresh count of involuntary manslaughter over the shooting. Local prosecutors shared ""additional facts"" from forensic tests on the weapon used in the shooting. The actor's lawyers told the BBC: ""We look forward to our day in court."" Alec Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . He has maintained he did not pull the trigger of the Colt .45 pistol and only drew back its hammer. Ms Gutierrez-Reed went on trial , pleading not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. Ms Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter but not guilty of evidence tampering. In closing arguments, prosecutors told jurors that she had failed to ensure the weapon was only loaded with dummy rounds - fake bullets used to look and sound like real ones. Ms Gutierrez-Reed did not testify, but her lawyer said prosecutors had failed to prove his client was the sole person responsible for the fatal shooting. Ms Gutierrez-Reed was given the maximum sentence of 18 months in prison. Before being sentenced, she tearfully addressed the court, saying that her heart ached for the Hutchins family and friends. ""The jury found me guilty; that does not make me a monster. That makes me human,"" she said. But the judge told her: ""You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon. But for you, Ms Hutchins would be alive.""",2 days ago,entertainment

Hopetown Darlington is ""on track"" to open in mid-July, the head of heritage and culture at Darlington Borough Council Mike Crawshaw said.

Mr Crawshaw said the site, which includes a live station, will celebrate Darlington's railway heritage. The site will feature a train-themed adventure playpark, along with a new exhibition hall and 4D virtual reality ride showing how rail travel changed the world. Visitors will also be able to watch volunteers from the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust at work. People will be able to arrive at the attraction by train. ""It's a live station and that's part of the beauty and appeal of the site, because you can sit and have a coffee and, as well as celebrating the history of the site, you've got the Bishop Line passing alongside parallel,"" Mr Crawshaw said.

164,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-68820057,Huntingdon's Oliver Cromwell Museum soars in popularity,"A museum chronicling the history of Civil War leader Oliver Cromwell has broken its own record, ""enjoying its highest visitor numbers in 25 years"". Cromwell, who ruled England as Lord Protector in 1653 after the execution of Charles I, was born in Huntingdon and was MP for the town. Stuart Orme, Huntingdon's Cromwell Museum curator, said 23% more people visited than the previous year, marking its busiest year since 1999. The museum is in Cromwell's old school. The school is the Cambridgeshire town's oldest building and is believed to hold the best collection of objects relating to his life and times in the world. It houses about 1,000 items including portraits, clothing, miniatures, arms and armour, and historical documents written by, or about, Cromwell. Cromwell helped the Parliamentarian forces defeat Charles I during the Civil War, which resulted in the monarch being tried and beheaded, and he went on to become Lord Protector. Source: The Cromwell Association Figures released by the museum show that during the 2023-4 financial year it had 13,261 visitors - an increase of more than 20%. ""This is against the 11% decline in visitor numbers reported recently by many visitor attractions nationally , as compared to pre-pandemic levels,"" historian Mr Orme said. ""We've had a great year with events, exhibitions and our recent refurbishment attracting more people than ever to come to see us,"" he said. ""There's also been an increased awareness and interest in this fascinating period of history, which for the first time raised questions about freedom, democracy, monarchy, religious toleration, freedom of the press, the role of women, relations with Ireland, Europe, and Empire… all things we are still wrestling with today. ""As such, our visitors are finding the 1600s more relevant than ever."" The museum is operated by an independent charity, the Cromwell Museum Trust. Its chair of trustees, Camilla Nichol, said: ""These figures are tremendous news for the museum and for Huntingdon. ""It was only a few years ago that the museum was at threat of being mothballed, but... we have shown how valued it is."" Follow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X . Got a story?

165,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmk0x3drl3o,Festival appeal after Arts Council funding blow,"The team behind Cheltenham Paint Festival has appealed for help, after it failed to get Arts Council funding. Featuring dozens of artists, the annual event is due to take place across the town in July. The 2023 event was initially cancelled due to lack of funds but went ahead after a crowdfunding effort. Organisers claim they had been encouraged by Arts Council of England to apply for funding after a site visit from a regional director of the organisation. Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire, festival founder Andy Davies said it was ""disappointing"". ""I accept there's a process and it's hard times, and an increasingly larger amount of people are applying for an increasingly smaller amount of money. ""But what's galling is, having looked at the project it does support, is they are ticketed, and gated, they have funds coming in. ""As a free arts festival, we don't have a gate, we can't charge people to get in to the town and it's very difficult to run without that sort of resource."" Mr Davies said it appears to be a common theme when he speaks to other festival directors, adding that Cheltenham has the appearance of being affluent, which he feels worked against him. ""If we don't get any more money, it'll be a damp squip and a small event... it's the big walls which we're really trying to get funding for,"" he concluded. Over the weekend, about £800 was raised for the event thanks to public donations, according to a post on the event's Facebook page. In a statement, the Arts Council said: ""We're pleased to have supported Cheltenham Paint Festival on a number of occasions in the past, but The National Lottery Project Grants programme is highly competitive and regrettably, there are always many more good applications than the Arts Council can fund. ""While the Festival's most recent application was unsuccessful, we welcome future submissions and remain in close contact with cultural stakeholders in the area.""",2 days ago,entertainment
166,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68739586,Salman Rushdie: Losing an eye upsets me every day,"Sir Salman Rushdie has spoken in chilling detail to the BBC about what he remembers of the attack two years ago, in which he was stabbed on stage. The Booker Prize-winning author said his eye was left hanging down his face ""like a soft-boiled egg"", and that losing the eye ""upsets him every day"". ""I remember thinking I was dying,"" he said. ""Fortunately, I was wrong."" Sir Salman said he is using his new book, Knife, as a way of fighting back against what happened. Sir Salman, who was born to non-practising Muslims and is an atheist, has long been a vocal advocate for the freedom of expression. But he warned it has become ""much more difficult"". ""A lot of people, including a lot of young people, I'm sorry to say, have formed the opinion that restrictions on freedom of speech are often a good idea,"" he said. ""Whereas of course, the whole point of freedom of speech is that you have to permit speech you don't agree with."" The attack took place at an education institute in New York state in August 2022, as he was preparing to give a lecture. He recalled how the assailant came ""sprinting up the stairs"" and stabbed him 12 times, including in his neck and abdomen, in an attack lasting 27 seconds. ""I couldn't have fought him,"" the author said. ""I couldn't have run away from him."" Sir Salman said he fell to the floor, where he lay with ""a spectacular quantity of blood"" all around him. He was taken to a hospital by helicopter and spent six weeks recovering there. The Indian-born British-American author, 76, is one of the most influential writers of modern times. The attack dominated news headlines across the world. Sir Salman previously spent several years in hiding after the 1988 publication of The Satanic Verses triggered threats against his life. He admitted he had thought someone might ""jump out of an audience"" one day. ""Clearly it would've been absurd for it not to cross my mind."" He said he'd had a ""nightmare"" about the attack, two days before his event, and as a result didn't want to go. ""And then I thought, you know, it's a dream. And plus, they're paying me quite well. Everybody's bought tickets. I should go."" The attack damaged Sir Salman's liver and hands, and severed nerves in his right eye. His eye looked ""very distended, swollen,"" he said. ""It was kind of hanging out of my face, sitting on my cheek, I've said like a soft-boiled egg. And blind."" Sir Salman said losing one eye ""upsets me every day"". He finds he has to take greater care when walking down stairs, or crossing a road, or even when pouring water into a glass. But he considers himself lucky to have avoided brain damage. ""It meant I was actually still able to be myself."" The moderator at the event where Sir Salman was stabbed told the BBC he wished he could have done more to prevent the attack. ""You feel like if you had acted quicker, a lot of this could've been prevented,"" said Henry Reese. But Sir Salman's gratitude to the people who helped him on the day, including Mr Reese, as well as the doctors who cared for him, is clear from the very opening page of Knife. The book is dedicated, simply, to ""the men and women who saved my life"". For the first time, Sir Salman has revealed what he would like to say to his alleged attacker. Hadi Matar, a 26-year-old New Jersey resident, has been charged with stabbing him. Mr Matar has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail. In an interview with the New York Post from jail, Mr Matar said he had watched videos of Sir Salman on YouTube. ""I don't like people who are disingenuous like that,"" Mr Matar said. Sir Salman Rushdie: The Interview Sir Salman Rushdie speaks about the knife attack which almost ended his life in 2022, in an interview with Alan Yentob ahead of the publication of a new book about the aftermath of the incident. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) In Knife, Sir Salman has an imaginary conversation with his attacker, in which he responds to that. ""In America, many people pretend to be honest, but they wear masks and lie. And would that be a reason to kill them all?"" he asks. Sir Salman has never met Mr Matar. But he is likely to come face to face with him in court when the trial gets under way. The trial was delayed after lawyers for the defendant argued they were entitled to review Sir Salman's book, as it could be evidence. It's now expected to take place in the autumn. Salman Rushdie shot to fame with Midnight's Children in 1981, which went on to sell more than one million copies in the UK alone. But his fourth book, The Satanic Verses', depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and its references to religion were considered blasphemous and banned in multiple Muslim-majority countries. Iran's then-leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa - or religious decree - in 1989, calling for Rushdie's assassination and placing a $3m (£2.4m) bounty on the author's head. That fatwa has never been rescinded. As a result, Rushdie was forced into hiding for nearly a decade and required an armed bodyguard due to the number of death threats he received. Sir Salman recalls how, when he was lying in a pool of blood, he found himself ""idiotically thinking"" about his personal belongings. He was worried his Ralph Lauren suit was getting ruined, and that his house keys and credit cards might fall out of his pocket. ""At the time of course, it's ludicrous. But in retrospect, what it says to me, is there was some bit of me that was not intending to die. There was some bit of me that was saying, 'I'm going to need those house keys, and I'm going to need those credit cards'."" He added that it was a ""survival instinct"" that was saying to him: ""You're going to live. Live. Live."" A year before the attack, Sir Salman married his fifth wife, the American poet and novelist Rachel Eliza Griffiths. Lady Rushdie told the BBC that when she heard about the attack, she ""just started screaming. This was the worst day of my life."" Lady Rushdie describes being at Sir Salman's side as doctors sewed his eyelids together. ""I love his eyes, and he left home with two of them, and then our world changed,"" she said. ""And now I love his single eye even more because of how he sees the world."" Sir Salman describes Knife as ""at least as much a love story"" as a story of horror. ""There were two forces in collision here. One was a force of violence, fanaticism, bigotry, and the other was the force of love,"" he said. ""And of course, the force of love is embodied in the figure of my wife Eliza."" ""And in the end, the way I understand what happened is that the force of love proved to be stronger than the forces of hatred."" Sir Salman said he will do public events again, but he will be ""more careful"" in future. ""The security question is going to be the first question. Unless I'm satisfied about that, I'm not going to do it."" But he added, he is ""a pretty obstinate person"". ""I don't want some restricted or confined life,"" he said. ""I'm going to have my life.""",3 days ago,entertainment

168,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190703-faith-ringgold-the-artist-who-captured-the-soul-of-the-us,Faith Ringgold: The artist who captured the soul of the US,"The pioneering artist, who died on Saturday, was an outspoken campaigner for justice. In 2019, she spoke to the BBC about her early life, and how she created subversive work with postage stamps and story quilts. “As an artist, I want to tell my story of the times – what I’ve lived through; what we’re going through now. Often, people don’t want to see that… but I don’t do what people want to see; I do what I can.” These days, crowds at major galleries clamour to see the work of Harlem-born painter/sculptor/writer and performance artist Faith Ringgold – who died on Saturday. But the artist fought hard throughout her life for that platform. Ringgold’s art is vivid and far-ranging (embracing over a dozen media, from her trademark narrative-based ‘story quilts’ to iconic masks and stained glass); it captures the soul of the US – its pop culture and politics – and lays it bare. It is fantastically vivacious, but also frequently speaks deeply uneasy truth to power. More like this: - Who was Picasso’s Weeping Wom a n? - Lee Krasner: Dazzling artworks of vibrant colour - Da Vinci’s lost masterpieces Over the past decade, there has been a kind of mainstream awakening; Ringgold has proved a stand-out at acclaimed group shows including Tate Modern’s Soul Of A Nation: Art In The Age Of Black Power (2017), and inspires dedicated exhibitions. Her high-profile fans include Oprah Winfrey, Bill Clinton and the late Maya Angelou. A celebration of Ringgold’s art – with many previously unseen works – showed in 2019 at London’s Serpentine Gallery; it was, Ringgold told the BBC, “a survey, not a retrospective”. In the 2004 book A View From The Studio (with Curlee Raven Holton), she explains: “I grew up in Harlem during the Great Depression. This does not mean I was poor and oppressed. We were protected from oppression and surrounded by a loving family.” Her neighbourhood was also home to the visionary jazz artists and poets that had fuelled the Harlem Renaissance; local legends like Langston Hughes and Duke Ellington were family friends. Ringgold’s mother, a talented seamstress and fashion designer, would later help her to develop the concept of ‘story quilts’: a portable alternative to large heavy canvases, ornately decorated, and updating a US folk-craft tradition with sharply modern statements. Aged 88, Ringgold spoke to the BBC in warmly upbeat tones; elegant yet steely, and also unmistakeably no-nonsense, exclaiming with a laugh: “In my family, there was no such thing as: ‘you can’t do that’… ‘yes, you can!’” In 1950, Ringgold became the first black scholar and woman to study art at the City College of New York (before her, only white men had been admitted to its ‘liberal arts programme’). Mainstream exclusion – and an eloquent, fearless response to it – has been a defining theme of Ringgold’s art. At school, she’d been struck by Horace Pippin’s 1942 painting John Brown Going To His Hanging, before finding out that Pippin was an African-American artist: the only one featured in her history books. “There was so much creativity around me: music, art, dance,” she told the BBC. “But there was also the fact that as black people, we were denied a position in the art world. Why was that happening? And are you going to let other people decide, or persevere?” The 1960s brought crucial turning points – including the 1964 US Civil Rights Act, which finally ended segregation in public spaces – and that creatively febrile, socially turbulent era also sealed the activist spirit of Ringgold’s art. “The ‘60s were so vibrant ,” she enthused. “It was a period where everything was happening, every day. I caught everything I could – but I also got left out of all the shows. “It was very difficult, but I didn’t know anything else. And I was able to create my art without any restrictions. Once you create an image, even if not many people see it, it’s a permanent form of expression.” Brutal beauty Ringgold’s expressions became increasingly visceral, in reaction to the US struggle for racial equality. There’s a devastating blend of beauty and brutality, and a righteous fury to key works such as Die (1967): its sprawl of bodies is reminiscent of Picasso’s Guernica (which Ringgold would often visit at NY’s Museum of Modern Art); in the midst of the violence are two kids – one black, one white – sheltering each other in a terrified embrace. “Oh my God, I’d think about what upsets me about these riots that they weren’t even reporting,” recalled Ringgold. “I’d get home, and people would be listening to the radio, but they hadn’t heard anything – and there’s blood on the streets!” She admitted: “When I started painting the blood, it was scary. I knew that I was painting death.” At the same time, her art has presented an irrepressible life force, even if mainstream institutions were initially closed off to it; she mentioned that she (unsuccessfully) tried to donate Dieto museums – it eventually sold, in 2011. Back in 1971, Ringgold endured a racial slur from a white male passer-by outside NY’s Whitney Museum, where she was participating in an anti-discrimination protest – she painted Hate Is A Sin Flag (smartly subverting the confederate design) in response; decades later, the piece was purchased and proudly displayed by the Whitney. In fact, Ringgold never really adhered to any conventions; her ‘Free Angela’ poster (1971) for activist party the Black Panthers was never produced – though she did eventually give a print to Angela Davies in person. “Just because they were political in their way, doesn’t mean that they accepted my visual expression,” she said. There’s a current trend for socially conscious kids’ storybooks; Ringgold was writing and illustrating her own decades ago, including the autobiographical Tar Beach (with its recurring motif of a young girl with unconstrained dreams – soaring high above New York’s rooftops), and historical epic Aunt Harriet’s Underground Railroad In The Sky (paying homage to heroic slave abolitionist/activist Harriet Tubman). We Came To America portrays the racial diversity and immigrant experience that really shaped the US. Even through its most unsettling themes, Ringgold’s art has always been pitched at the heart of the nation – whether she was using a postage-stamp design to commemorate black power (1967), or displaying her work in public spaces: her larger-than-life jazz-dance frieze Groovin’ High (1987, inspired by Dizzy Gillespie) was shown above NYC’s High Line, and the joyous mosaic design of Flying Home appeared inside 125th Street subway station (depicting Harlem luminaries soaring past landmarks such as the Apollo Theatre). Her multi-media flair has extended to indie-games design (the lushly-hued Quilt Sudoku app). “Old is phenomenal today!” she declared. “There’s so many old people in the world, and I’m one of them – I wanna be out there, producing art!” The power of perseverance is timeless; for Ringgold, the soul of America remained boundless.

Fans watched the singer scream in frustration after a string of problems - such as songs playing at double-speed - marred the second half of her festival slot. Posting on X, the singer said it was ""one of the first times"" she had ""outsourced essential things"". ""I will not let such a thing happen again,"" she said. She added she would ""personally organise"" everything for the festival's second weekend. ""I've spent months on this show, making music and visuals, and admittedly am not in the best mood atm."" It wasn't the only moment from the event, held in Indio, California, to go viral on social media for the wrong reasons. A clip of Blur's performance was widely shared online, after frontman Damon Albarn criticised the crowd for failing to sing along during 90s hit Girls & Boys. ""You're never seeing us again so you might as well sing it,"" he said. ""Know what I'm saying?"" Song 2 had a better reaction - which might have been due to its popularity online. Introducing the song, Damon said: ""This song has been so good to us. ""But I did get shown a TikTok of it being kind of performed by a vacuum cleaner which is you know…. It is humbling and inspiring at the same time."" The first weekend was headlined by Lana Del Rey, Tyler the Creator and Doja Cat. And as usual at Coachella, there were some surprise guest appearances - with Olivia Rodrigo turning up to sing with No Doubt. It was the first performance from the Gwen Stefani-fronted rock band in almost a decade, and Olivia joined them to sing Bathwater. Singer Kesha also showed up during Mean Girls star Reneé Rapp's set to duet on a rewrite of 2010 hit Tik Tok. The pair changed lyrics about P Diddy in an apparent reference to a series of sexual assault allegations faced by the rapper. Four women, including his long-time partner Casandra ""Cassie"" Ventura, have filed lawsuits accusing the musician of sexual and physical abuse, which he strongly denies. Lana Del Rey headlined the Friday night, and also brought out special guests - including Billie Eilish, Jon Batiste and Jack Antonoff. But Jack's band Bleachers attracted the biggest guest stars of the weekend, even though they didn't make it on-stage. Watching from the audience was Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, NFL player Travis Kelce, who were spotted dancing by fans. Taylor's album The Tortured Poets Department, which Jack is rumoured to have worked on, is out on Friday.

Alf Hunter, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, worked on more than 60 films including the first three films in the sci-fi franchise and the Indiana Jones series. The 90-year-old, who started working at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood in 1951, said he developed a reputation for his skills in set painting and was regularly requested by directors. Thinking back to his work on the 1977 blockbuster, he said: “I told George Lucas that I could tell when a film was going to be a winner and Stars Wars was up there."" Mr Hunter also worked on the Stanley Kubrick classics The Shining and A Clockwork Orange, and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. His daughter, Lisa Hunter, 53, said she clearly remembered visiting the Star Wars set as a young girl and going inside the Millennium Falcon. She said: “I didn’t know what it was at the time but remember Dad telling me not to touch anything."" BBC Sounds: The man who painted the Millennium Falcon After Star Wars, Mr Hunter went on to work on Raiders of the Lost Ark with fellow decorator Jack Josey and said they always appreciated the film’s director personally thanking ‘two hairy-arsed decorators'. He recalled: ""Steven Spielberg shook my hand and thanked me for my sets.""

The co-creator of Belfast-based police drama Blue Lights has described its second series as a ""worthy successor"". The drama follows a batch of newly-qualified officers navigating policing in a post-conflict Northern Ireland. Blue Lights - which was co-created and written by Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson - launched to more than seven million viewers last year. This article contains spoilers from Blue Lights series one ""There's a sense that you feel when you come back for a second season that there's something that people have liked, or even loved,"" Lawn told BBC News. ""It's always up to the audiences, you can never take anything for granted."" Lawn said the latest offering of Blue Lights continues to explore the ""relentless, grinding daily pressure"" of policing in Northern Ireland. ""There's something about it being here with the particular pressures and dangers they face that make people across the water [Great Britain] intrigued by it,"" he explained. The February 2023 shooting of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell in Omagh, County Tyrone, was a reminder of the threat still faced by police officers in Northern Ireland. During almost 30 years of violence known as the Troubles, 302 police officers were killed. Series two takes place one year after the death of PC Gerry Cliff who was shot while on duty at the end of series one. ""The death of Gerry was calculated for us because we knew it was going to be the genesis of series two,"" Mr Lawn explained. Adam Patterson added: ""The whole creative team made a conscious decision to move the story a year on. Part of the reason for that is that if we had picked it up right away then every story would have been consumed by Gerry and we needed the actors to go on different journeys. ""In a lot of ways he still lives on in many of our characters but by moving the story on a year it allows us to look at different parts of the police and parts of the city."" The passage of time has also allowed for some character development, according to Nathan Braniff who portrays PC Tommy Foster. ""He's getting into it a bit more, he's progressing,"" Braniff said. ""The thing about Blue Lights and what makes it different is you're going very in-depth to these characters who are rookies, and that's something that hasn't been done before."" Siân Brooke also feels her character, PC Grace Ellis, has become ""much more experienced in the job"" but said her home life has been turned ""upside-down"". ""The world that Declan and Adam have created has expanded even more and you begin to understand the complexities of the crimes the characters are encountering in their day-to-day jobs,"" she said. ""The stakes are high. It will be quite explosive, moving and an authentic reflection of some parts of present-day Belfast, but audiences can still expect those comedy beats alongside the serious side of the story."" While viewers may look forward to welcoming familiar cast members back to their screens, there are also some fresh faces to connect with. Seamus O'Hara, who starred in the Academy Award-winning short film An Irish Goodbye , joins the cast for series two. He plays Lee Thompson, a Protestant from east Belfast who becomes entangled in a loyalist feud which causes ""absolute chaos on the streets for our officers"", according to Lawn. ""After serving in Afghanistan he sees a different kind of war on the streets of Belfast,"" O'Hara explained. ""He very quickly identifies a new enemy - drugs - a threat to the well-being of his community and he goes after that with everything he's got."" The actor said he researched ""a world of tradition"" to ready himself for the role to ensure he had no ""preconceptions or assumptions about that community"". ""A fellow actor took me on tours of Belfast so that I could look at it with fresh eyes,"" Seamus continued. ""What I wanted to discover most of all was what Lee was most proud of as a unionist man and as soon as I started to explore that it pushed me in the right direction."" Blue Lights was in the top 10 new drama series of 2023 across all broadcasters and streamers, and the biggest drama series in Northern Ireland in 2023. In February, the BBC ordered two more six-part series of Blue Lights. ""It's really unprecedented thing for a series to be commissioned for series three and four before series two goes out,"" Lawn said. ""It helps enormously to develop a series four... [there'll be] certain things we'll leave hanging at the end of series three."" Blue Lights series two premieres on BBC One on Monday 15 April at 21:00 BST, with the full series available on BBC iPlayer.",3 days ago,entertainment
174,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68813520,Olivier Awards 2024: Nicole Scherzinger musical Sunset Boulevard equals record,"Sunset Boulevard was the big winner at Sunday's Olivier Awards, equalling the record for the most prizes for a musical at the ceremony. Its seven wins included best musical revival and acting awards for its stars Nicole Scherzinger and Tom Francis. Other winners included Succession star Sarah Snook, who won best actress for her performance in an adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Haydn Gwynne also won an acting prize, six months after her death aged 66. Accepting her award, Scherzinger joked: ""I always really wanted to be a singer and do musicals, and I dreamed of so many roles that I wanted to do. And honestly this role, Norma Desmond, was not one of those roles. ""But God works in mysterious ways,"" she laughed as the audience applauded, ""because it's honestly one of the ballsiest and bravest things I've ever done, and I've had an incomparable director Jamie Lloyd to thank for that."" Sunset Boulevard's seven wins means it ties with Cabaret, Matilda and Hamilton for the most trophies ever for a musical in a single night. Lloyd's revival of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical was staged with a monochrome colour scheme and a minimalist set design. But its lack of scenery, colour and props didn't stop it from garnering five-star reviews from critics, particularly for Scherzinger, who shot to fame two decades ago with girl group the Pussycat Dolls. The musical closed in London in January but is due to transfer to Broadway later this year. Scherzinger's co-star Francis thanked the security team at the Savoy Theatre ""for making me feel safe every night"" - a reference partly to one section where he walks out of the theatre onto the streets of London while being followed by video cameras. Sarah Snook, who scored an Emmy Award earlier this year for her performance in HBO's Succession, continued her winning streak at the Oliviers, which were held at the Royal Albert Hall. The star was named best actress for her performance in The Picture Of Dorian Gray, a one-woman adaptation which sees Snook play 26 characters. In her acceptance speech, Snook said it was an ""incredible honour to be on the stage in the West End"". ""It's billed as a one-woman show but it's not, the crew are on stage with me every night, and they are a vital and constant support, and inspirational."" Snook is surrounded by stage crew throughout the show, who help with costume and scene changes. The production also makes use of technology, with Snook interacting with other characters on screens using footage she has pre-recorded. One-person shows have been a particular trend in the West End in recent months, with Andrew Scott, Jodie Comer and Billy Crudup among the other stars performing solo. A production of Anton Chekhov's Vanya starring Scott was named best play revival at the Oliviers. Six months after her death at 66, Haydn Gwynne was named best supporting actress for her performance in When Winston Went to War with the Wireless. The play, written by Jack Thorne, examined the power struggles between the UK government and the BBC in the 1920s. It was staged at the Donmar Warehouse for two months last summer. Accepting the award on her behalf, her son Orlando Phipps said: ""I really don't know what my mum would have said if she was here, but it was a career-long dream of hers to win an Olivier, so she would've been thrilled. ""She loved the stage above all other kinds of acting. She said if you came away from the show having made one good friend, it was worth doing, and she often made many."" The actress was also known for TV shows including Drop the Dead Donkey, Peak Practice, Merseybeat and The Windsors. The award for best new play went to Dear England, which is about Gareth Southgate and the England football team. Accepting the award, writer James Graham joked: ""I literally can't kick a ball, I don't know why I'm here."" He used his acceptance speech to thank the teachers at his Nottingham comprehensive school, adding that he was ""so grateful"" for his teachers for thinking ""working class kids"" should learn theatre. Will Close won best supporting actor and thanked footballer Harry Kane, whom he played in the production, and co-star Joseph Fiennes for being a ""hero"". ""In the words of Harry, this is really nice,"" he smiled. The actor dedicated the award to ""my mum who passed away during Covid"", adding: ""Here's to all the single mums in council housing."" Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was The Motive And The Cue star Mark Gatiss winning best actor in a play. It had been one of the starriest categories of the evening, with Gatiss holding off competition from David Tennant, Andrew Scott, James Norton and Joseph Fiennes. After his name was mis-pronounced, the actor opened his acceptance speech by saying: ""It's Gay-tiss, by the way."" The audience laughed and applauded as he added: ""I've been saying that for 57 years."" He described his role as ""the part of a lifetime, that's all I can say"", and paid tribute to writer Jack Thorne and director Sir Sam Mendes. He thanked his husband, actor and writer Ian Hallard, for ""putting up with my haircut for the last two years"". Elsewhere, best new musical went to Operation Mincemeat, which has been extended several times since its West End transfer following rave reviews from audiences and critics. The show also won best supporting actor in a musical for Jak Malone, who thanked his ""amazing partner Jasmine, and my really handsome dog Dracula"". ""When I was 13 I won best actor at a drama festival in Merseyside,"" he recalled. ""And my nanny Joan leapt with such pride that she had to collect her glasses from a stranger a few seats behind her, and if nanny Joan was here tonight, I think we'd have to peel her off the ceiling."" Meanwhile, best new entertainment or comedy play went to Stranger Things: The First Shadow, which serves as a prequel to the Netflix series. Writer Kate Trefry said that winning was ""psychotic"", and thanked creators Matt and Ross Duffer, as well as the ""fans, for being freaks"". Dame Arlene Phillips won best theatre choreography for Guys & Dolls, commenting: ""This is hysterical, I'm now 80 and it's my first Olivier Award,"" prompting a standing ovation from the crowd. She thanked fellow choreographer James Cousins for helping her by ""crawling around"" on the floor to demonstrate the movements when she had issues with her knees. Other winners included Amy Trigg, who won best supporting actress in a musical for The Little Big Things. ""I never dreamed our little show would come to this, and it just means so much that it has,"" she said. However, one nominee who was not in attendance was Hollywood actress Sarah Jessica Parker. The Sex and the City star finished her residency in London's West End, where she has been appearing in Plaza Suite, on Saturday night, but was understood to be flying home to the US on Sunday.

Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who said they would be taking a break from the show last year, were joined by a host of stars for the two-hour show. Hosting the series had been an ""honour and a privilege"", McPartlin said, while Donnelly said they ""truly adored every second of making the show"". The episode averaged 4.6m viewers, up on the 2023 finale which averaged 4.3m. But more people tuned into this series' launch episode than Saturday's finale, figures show. A star-studded cast appeared in the finale including Holly Willoughby, Rylan Clark, Olly Murs, Davina McCall, Gino D'Acampo and Girls Aloud. Crowds waiting outside the studio were also entertained by a Craig David DJ set. In a joint statement on Instagram, McPartlin and Donnelly wrote: ""Thank you, thank you, thank you. ""To all the guests, crew, and most importantly you at home who have made the last 20 series so incredible to be part of. We are so grateful to everyone who tuned in and we couldn't have done it without you."" The pair were also joined by S Club, Tony Hadley and Kaiser Chiefs and McFly, who sang a version of their song All About You to the presenters. Music mogul Simon Cowell and This Morning presenters Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary also appeared, alongside TV presenter Andi Peters and radio host Jordan North. ITV1 recorded its biggest overnight audience of 2023 with the previous year's series launch, which pulled in 6.4 million viewers. The launch episode for this year's series pulled in the lowest number of viewers for an opening episode since the programme began in 2002. It aired on 24 February, and was watched by an average of 4.9m people. This decline is reflective of UK audiences' television habits, Ofcom has said. Last year, Ofcom reported traditional TV viewing in the UK as a whole saw it its sharpest ever decline , with the proportion of people who tune in weekly down from 83% in 2021 to 79% in 2022. The highest-rated episode of Saturday Night Takeaway aired on 21 March 2020, just before Covid lockdown in the UK, pulling in 9.5m viewers. Despite the lower viewership this year, the finale attracted the most viewers across the entire day on any channel, and contributed to ITV1 have the largest share of viewing across any channel on Saturday. McPartlin and Donnelly have worked together for more than 30 years, and launched Saturday Night Takeaway in 2002. In May last year, the duo said they would take a break at the end of 2024 series, after reaching a ""milestone"" 20th series. This is not the first time the show has been paused. In 2009 it took a four year hiatus, returning with the pair at its helm in 2013. However, fans of the Geordie duo need not fear as McPartlin and Donnelly will continue to host other shows for ITV, including I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! and Limitless Win. They will also be back on TV screens later this month, hosting the 17th season of Britain's Got Talent.",4 days ago,entertainment
177,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj7mnneprzlo,Museums cut 90 jobs and may close Cardiff building,"Wales’ national museums will axe at least 90 jobs after a big cut in their funding, and more may still go, says the head of the organisation. One of its best known buildings, National Museum Cardiff, may also be forced to close because of its deteriorating condition, warned Jane Richardson. The chief executive of Museum Wales – which has seven sites around the nation – spoke of the ""extremely difficult"" task of dealing with a £4.5m reduction in its budget. The Welsh government said it was making ""extremely difficult decisions"" due to its own budget being £700m less in real terms than it was in 2021. Ms Richardson told BBC Radio Wales’ Sunday Supplement that the museums would also charge visitors for special events such as tours and exhibitions, and close earlier in the winter. Museum Wales has had a £3m reduction in its grant, but it said that because it continues to incur a year-on-year deficit of £1.5m, it had to address a total deficit of £4.5m by the end of March. Ms Richardson said the museum only heard what the cut would be just before Christmas ""so it's been extremely difficult for my whole team to make a change on that scale within a matter of weeks"". She said 90% of costs were for staff, and she had ""never ever known anything like this"" at any of the organisations where she had worked. Ms Richardson did not give an exact figure for the number of jobs going at the organisation, which, according to the museum website, has more than 600 staff and about 1.8 million visitors a year. But she added: ""I always said that to get to the kind of number that we needed to we would be looking at at least 90 jobs and that has proven to be the case, but we're still not at a total figure yet."" She said there was a ""massive"" problem with the condition of National Museum Cardiff. ""Unless we're able to secure more funding for that building that that will have to close,"" she said. The chief executive said Cardiff council had already shut the next door building, City Hall, which is the same age and had ""exactly the same problems as us"". ""So when you have water coming through and failing electrics, there is a question hanging over the future of that building anyway."" She said unless there was more money for the Cardiff museum – which houses ""extraordinarily special objects"" - it could close. ""I mean we would obviously then be looking at where else we could have a presence in Cardiff. ""And, you know, there'll be all sorts of conversations about how we did that. ""But we are really clear as an organisation that that building needs urgent critical work for us to be able to continue opening to the public."" Ms Richardson said museum officials were ""being as positive as we can about this massive budget cut"", with a restructure and a new strategy to get more income. There was some good news for the organisation last week with the award of a £412,000 lottery grant for the National Slate Museum in Llanberis, Gwynedd, which Ms Richardson called ""enormously exciting"". ""However, if we were to get further cuts on that scale, I would need to be very honest with government and with all our stakeholders that we could not continue to run as the size of museum we are now,"" she said. ""We would have to look at our buildings."" They are: National Museum Cardiff; St Fagans National Museum of History, Cardiff; National Waterfront Museum, Swansea; Big Pit National Coal Museum, in Blaenavon, Torfaen; National Slate Museum, in Llanberis, Gwynedd; National Wool Museum, near Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire; and National Roman Legion Museum, Caerleon, Newport. Ms Richardson said the museums would not reintroduce charging for entry because they would be worse off after losing tax advantages as a result. But they would encourage donations by visitors, charge for special events such as The Art of the Selfie exhibition in Cardiff , featuring a painting by the Dutch master Van Gogh, and ""pull back"" on winter opening times. Conservative culture spokesman Tom Giffard called the museum's situation ""concerning not just for the individuals who will be impacted, but for all of us"". He added: “Disproportionate funding cuts are putting the preservation of our shared heritage at risk, while the Labour Welsh government prioritises money for more politicians.” The Welsh government said work had been undertaken to assess the budget cuts and that it was in discussions about the future of National Museum Cardiff. A spokesman said: “We have been clear our budget is up to £700m less in real terms than when it was set in 2021 and we have had to take extremely difficult decisions.”",4 days ago,entertainment
178,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240412-the-ancient-philosophy-behind-blueys-blockbuster-episode-the-sign,The ancient philosophy behind Bluey's blockbuster episode The Sign,"This epic 28-minute instalment of the kids TV show, streaming on Disney+ from today, has been hotly anticipated – and its story is a deep reflection on change that proves, once more, it's truly transcendental viewing. Last November, some Earth-shattering news for one global fandom dropped, when it was announced that an extended blockbuster episode of the kids' cartoon show Bluey was in production – running to an epic 28 minutes. Now, after months of hype, The Sign premieres around the world today, and is an uplifting and energetic family drama about change, all playing out in its signature colourful and quirky way. Warning: this article contains spoilers for new Bluey episode The Sign The much-loved Australian cartoon about Bluey, a seven-year-old blue heeler dog, her younger sister, Bingo, their mum and dad, Chilli and Bandit, and extended family and friends, has been a worldwide phenomenon since it launched back in 2018 (screening on ABC Kids in Australia, Disney Junior in the US, and the BBC and Disney+ in the UK). At its heart, like all the very best children's shows, the creator Joe Brumm has made a series that entertains and engages the adults as much as the children. Much of the plot of each seven-minute episode centres around the games the two puppies play with each other and their friends (inspired by Brumm watching his own daughters play and interact with each other), often overseen by Bandit, the world's most hyper-present and effusive dad . But alongside more genuinely laugh-out-loud moments than in most primetime comedies or sitcoms, it contains more serious elements too – snapshots of parenting situations that will be painfully familiar to any guardians or caregivers, as well as inferences to momentous life events like death, marriage, miscarriage and infertility. However, lest that sound bleak, these are all presented through the colourful gaze of two little dogs dressed up as blanket-clad old grannies, or singing a made-up song about a "" poor little bug on a wall, ding ching "". It's this enmeshing of navigating an adult world with the joyous, surreal excitement of childhood which has led to the show being called "" the best television series in the world "" by The Guardian, and landed Bluey an International Emmy award in 2019.  Many families, like my own, discovered the show during lockdown, and the new episodes couldn't come quick enough. But the third series, which premiered in Australia in 2021 and in the US and UK in 2022, was split into batches, and has been stretched out across more than two years in some parts of the world. The two new episodes, Ghost Basket, which premiered last weekend, and The Sign, are expected to be its finale, unless the Bluey team have any more surprise episodes up their sleeves for this season. Rumours of a 28-minute special episode first began on Reddit last spring. Ludo, the production company that make Bluey stayed schtum until the November announcement, when it was confirmed with a title, The Sign, and a teaser trailer on the official Bluey website . With the confirmation from its makers, then the speculation began in earnest about what would happen in it to justify its extended length. ""I actually think we're getting a character death, and I think it's Grandpa Bob,"" suggested a fan in one Bluey Reddit subgroup, while another person said of the episode's name: ""I think The Sign is a 'plus sign' on a pregnancy test for Rad and Frisky [Bluey and Bingo's respective uncle and godmother]"". Another commented: ""The Sign is more likely going to be the wedding episode, and if not that then it might be about the Heelers either moving or going on vacation or something."" Some of these theories were spot on: in The Sign, the Heelers do sell their house and plan to move away (initially), as first revealed in Ghost Basket. There is also a wedding between Rad and Frisky – almost jeopardised when another family member puts their foot in it. While another older relative makes a welcome return, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment revealing the happy news that Bluey's aunt Brandy is pregnant (following the suggestion that she had fertility issues in the emotional episode Onesies) is likely to make some adult viewers well-up. Oh and happily for any Muffin fans – myself included – Bluey's cousin and a young agent of chaos is once again at the front and centre of the action. But what viewers won't have predicted will be how much this episode draws from Taoist philosophy, an ancient Chinese belief system based on trying to exist in harmony with the universe. When Bluey sadly tells her classmates she's moving away (cue cute howlings from all the pups), her ever-Zen teacher Calypso reads a story called The Farmer. The story follows a series of events happening, and each time, the neighbours tell the farmer that it's ""good luck"" or ""bad luck"". Every time, the farmer simply replies to each situation: ""we'll see"", and the story then ends seemingly abruptly. More like this: The Bluey episodes that left fans distraught The bizarre kids' TV show that swept the world Why embracing change is key to a good life ""Is it a happy or sad ending?"" asks Bluey afterwards. ""It's both,"" says Calypso. ""I don't understand,"" says Bluey. ""Everything will work out the way it's supposed to, Bluey,"" she replies. The story is actually an old tale first that originated in the Huainanzi, an ancient Chinese text dating back to 139 BC, and it reminds people that we have no control or no real way of knowing whether events that happen to us are ""good"" or ""bad"", in the grand scheme of things. All we can be certain of is that change is inevitable, as young Bluey and Bingo find out in this particular episode, but being open to change and trusting that things will work out for the best is the best way to tackle it. Mirroring the story of the farmer, the idea of ""luck"" runs throughout The Sign, with Bluey finding a ""lucky coin"" that initially jams a public look-out telescope (""not so lucky coin,"" her companion notes), but in a twist of fate later effects momentous change in the dogs' favour, so that the sheepdog buyers of their family home pull out. The concept of the butterfly effect is also represented literally, with the reappearance of a blue butterfly called Flappy – a callback to an earlier season three episode called Slide, where Bingo and her friend Lila rescue a caterpillar, which eventually transforms into a butterfly. Flappy turns up in Chilli's car, while she and the puppies are searching for a missing Frisky. The creator Joe Brumm had previously hinted at this moment on the Behind Bluey podcast when discussing Slide, saying ""there is a little connection to a later episode and so it's a very special episode in the context of season three.” In Slide, when the butterfly lands on Bingo and Lila's paws, Lila says: ""That's lucky!"", and in The Sign she is proven correct, when the reappearing butterfly leads the search team to find Frisky, further encapsulating the theory that we can't ever really know how events will pan out, but sometimes fate leads you to the right place. Of course, this isn't the first Bluey episode to get deep and meaningful, as borrowings from philosophy and reflections on what it means to be alive are regularly peppered throughout the series. Second season episode Sleepytime – regularly cited as the best Bluey episode of all time – saw Bingo drifting off into her subconscious and out into the cosmos, as her mum (as the Sun) told her she'll always be there and will always love her. Then there was season three episode Puppets in which the Unicorse toy – brought to life by Bandit – asks Bluey, just before her bedtime: ""How can you be sure that you're not a puppet?"" – then after she falls asleep, the fourth wall is broken, showing Bluey being drawn into the scene by an animator. ""Wow, that was a weird dream!"" she says, when she wakes up. Speaking on the How Other Dads Dad podcast , Brumm claimed that ""There's not meant to be any education in Bluey"", adding: ""there's no lessons to learn. It's entertainment"". However The Sign, like the rest of the series, says otherwise. While the weightier issues of life that feature throughout the cartoons perhaps often go over younger viewers' heads, what the show does unite all ages in is its reminder to take a step back from everything and wonder and bask in in the miracles of everyday life. The final few minutes of The Sign affirm this. After a series of unexpected events, but ultimately as a result of Bandit listening to his family, the Heeler family end up staying in their house in Brisbane – a twist that will please many fans, who were worried about them moving away. In a climactic scene, they sit around a makeshift dinner table, laughing and really engaging with each other as a euphoric song ( Lazarus Drug , by Meg Washington, who also voices the teacher Calypso in Bluey) plays in the background. ""I'm everything and everyone who is or ever was / And You're nothingness, but shining / and everywhere at once / You're everything where everyone who is or ever was, forever"", the lyrics run, carrying on the episode's ruminations about how we're all interconnected, and that can help us to live in harmony. It's incredibly heartwarming and once again highlights that it's not a dog's life, it's truly transcendental TV. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today progamme last week , Bluey producer Sam Moor confirmed The Sign is ""not the end"" for the series. And now we've had this blockbuster episode, may the show get more ambitious still? Speaking to Deadline , Brumm said the experience of making the extra-long episode could potentially propel him into making a feature-length Bluey film at some point: ""I'm loving going longer on The Sign, and I'd love to try to go longer - I definitely would not rule that out."" Will the legions of ardent fans get lucky? We'll see. The Bluey episode The Sign is available now on Disney+ in the UK and US, and screens today on Disney Junior and Disney Channel in the US -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

179,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgylx0w613o,'Save our small venues' plea amid government review,"Artists and promoters are calling for more support for grassroots music venues. Pressure from soaring costs and post-pandemic problems have left scores of small music venues fearing for their future. The Music Venue Trust says gig venues shut at a rate of two a week nationally in 2023, an issue now being examined by the government. Promoters in north-east England told the BBC more action was needed to protect the region's ""vital"" venues. On a wet Thursday night in Newcastle, two men walk on stage wearing Mexican wrestling masks to thrash out hardcore punk music. The band is called MiNUSS. The audience, while not huge, is enthusiastic. They are performing at Trillians Rock Bar, a long-established part of the North East's music scene. The venue provides a stage for artists, and a space for music lovers to be themselves. But there are concerns about the future of live music in places like Trillians. Rising costs are putting pressure on artists and promoters, and the grassroots scene is reportedly still struggling with the after-effects of the pandemic. ""After Covid, it's been a lot harder,"" Craig Relf said. He is the singer in hair metal headline act High Force, and a promoter. ""If you are booking bands that are more well established, it's no problem,"" he said. ""But a lot of venues are pricing out the local scene. ""A lot of local promoters put gigs on and they make some money, but not a lot, and most of the time they lose money."" Mr Relf said there were not many venues like Trillians left, where local bands were paid to perform. Middlesbrough's music lovers suffered a recent blow with the closure of the popular Westgarth Social Club, which had brought the likes of James Bay and Wolf Alice to the town. ""A lot of the indie bands that went on to be successful had some of their first gigs here,"" promoter Henry Carden told the BBC, as he stood outside the now empty venue. The club's closure means the town is now without a medium-sized concert hall. Mr Carden is part of the team behind Twisterella Festival, a multi-venue event about to mark its tenth anniversary. ""Of the venues we used in the first year, there's only the university still here,"" he said, and estimated the loss of up to five venues. Middlesbrough's music scene is not dead - there are gigs regularly held in cafes, galleries and large venues, like its town hall. But artists say the lack of smaller, dedicated venues means it is difficult to build a following. Singer songwriter Jodie Nicholson is trying to do just that. “It’s such a massive part of artist’s development, especially trying to break out of a local scene,” she said. “One of the key parts of that is being able to prove to promoters that you can sell tickets, sell out venues, and get to ever bigger capacities."" She is ""further on"" than playing in a 50-person space, but considers jumping to a 1,000-capacity venue ""too big a leap"". “It’s hitting that sweet spot of 100-150 capacity,"" she said. In neighbouring Stockton, it is a different story. It still has a number of medium-sized venues, including Ku Bar, NE Volume and the Georgian Theatre, where the likes of Arctic Monkeys and Sam Fender played on their rise to fame. The Georgian's manager, Christopher Cobain, said it was vital to recognise the importance of such venues for local bands. ""For some local artists, playing the 300-capacity Georgian Theatre is like playing Wembley Stadium,"" he said. A House of Commons select committee for culture, which includes Sunderland MP Julie Elliot, has been gathering evidence in an attempt to find a way to support grassroots venues. Mr Cobain believes VAT relief and a levy on stadium and arena shows could help. “On every ticket we sell there’s 20% VAT on, every pint we sell there’s VAT on. So a lot of our income goes out of the door straight away,” he said. “And I think the music industry itself can do with looking internally – we’ve had artists who have started off at small venues like ours who are playing massive arenas. ""What could they do to pass that on to the smaller artists and venues?” Back at the abandoned Westgarth Social Club, Henry Carden said long-term funding was needed. “You might need, two, three, five, ten years, even, to realised what you are trying to do, and I don’t think a lot of the funding that’s available allows you to do that,"" he said. The select committee's report is expected in the coming months. Follow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

180,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68782741,Tuxford horse museum opened in spare rooms marks 10 years,"A museum dedicated to horses which started as a passion project in the spare rooms of a gallery will soon celebrate its 10th anniversary. Sally Mitchell opened the Museum of the Horse in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, after originally buying the building to create a gallery for her art. The artist, now 78, decided to dedicate empty space upstairs to her love of the animals. Today the museum holds hundreds of pieces of horse-related paraphernalia. Ms Mitchell opened the museum in June 2014 in an old posting house - once used to keep horses - and it has since gone on to win awards and feature on TV, she said. After previously visiting equestrian museums in France and Germany, she felt England, which she called ""a great equestrian country"", needed one of its own. ""I think people think I'm a dotty little old lady and it's only going to be a funny, little room but there's a lot of stuff here,"" she said. The museum shares the history of the horse, with collections about their links to travel, manufacturing industries the military and more. She added: ""I have to admit, I spend a couple of hours every day checking searches on auction rooms all over England and all over the world looking for things."" Ms Mitchell added that people of all ages were ""always amazed"" when they visited the museum. To mark its 10-year anniversary, the museum is hosting a series of events, exhibitions and family open days between June and September. An exhibition of recent acquisitions will be displayed to mark the anniversary from 9 June until the end of August. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

181,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgy5k5020lo,Rarely seen Quentin Blake art to go on show,"Illustrations that have never been on public display before by Sir Quentin Blake, one of the country's most prolific and popular artists, are to go on show. The Illustrated Hospital exhibition will take place at Moyse's Hall Museum, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, from 4 June until 6 October. The pieces in the large collection were created to adorn the walls of hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the UK and France. The museum said the exhibition would highlight its reputation for ""punching way above its weight"" after works by contemporary artists Bansky and Tracey Emin had helped to attract thousands of visitors. Since 2005, the Cambridge University graduate's art produced for medical settings had ""been a significant part of his work"", organisers said. His murals are displayed on a number of hospital walls, including Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. ""Because of their clinical function, many of the spaces are not easily accessible to visitors, so relatively few people - only patients and hospital staff - may get the chance to see them,"" the museum said. Created in his ""instantly recognisable style"", the drawings feature swimming babies, helpful dragons, treetop adventures and poignant landscapes. Sir Quentin is known for his collaborations with writers such as Russell Hoban, Michael Rosen and Roald Dahl. In 1999 he was appointed the first children's laureate, and he was knighted in the 2022 Queen's Birthday Honours List. The work has been co-curated by Sir Quentin's team and the West Suffolk Council-run museum. Organisers said it was one of Moyse's Hall's ""most important exhibitions"" and ""further enhances the attraction’s growing reputation for punching way above its weight for a provincial museum"". There will be workshops for children, and Folksy Theatres' performance of  Quentin Blake: Angelia Sprocket’s Pockets can be seen at West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village, near Bury St Edmunds, on Friday 9 August.

Hollywood names are leading the nominations this year with the likes of Sarah Snook, Nicole Scherzinger and Sarah Jessica Parker all recognised. Shows including Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Guys & Dolls and Dear England are also up for awards. The Oliviers celebrate the best of British theatre and is the industry's most prestigious awards ceremony. Hit musical Sunset Boulevard is leading nominations this year with 11 nods, including Nicole Scherzinger and Tom Francis for best actress and actor in a musical respectively. The minimalist production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's story of a fading film star, also received nominations for best musical revival and best director for Jamie Lloyd. Meanwhile, Dear England , James Graham's play about Gareth Southgate is the most nominated play. The footballing drama has received nine nods, with Joseph Fiennes receiving his first Olivier nomination. The National Theatre scored 15 nominations in total across its shows Dear England , Hadestown , The Motive and the Cue, Till the Stars Come Down and The Effect . The best new musical nominees are The Little Big Things, Next to Normal, Operation Mincemeat and A Strange Loop . The best musical revival category also has a number of strong favourites, including Groundhog Day, which won the Olivier Award for best new musical in 2017 and Guys & Dolls. A host of Hollywood stars are nominated this year. Sarah Jessica Parker has scored her first Olivier nomination for Plaza Suite where she appears opposite her husband Matthew Broderick. Several one-person plays received nominations in the best actor and actress categories - including Sarah Snook for The Picture of Dorian Gray, Andrew Scott for Vanya and Sheridan Smith for Shirley Valentine. Snook, who recently won an Emmy for her performance in Succession, plays 26 characters in the play and is surrounded by a camera crew so her performance can be beamed onto overhead screens. The Adelaide-born actress told the BBC last month she was ""stoked and just a bit overwhelmed"" upon learning of her nomination. Elsewhere, Happy Valley star James Norton is up for an award for his performance in a stage adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara's hugely popular and Booker-nominated novel A Little Life. David Tennant also scored a best actor nomination for his portrayal of Macbeth at the Donmar Warehouse. And Eleanor Worthington-Cox has been nominated for best actress in a supporting role in a musical for her performance in Next To Normal. In 2012, at just 10 years old, she was the youngest ever Olivier winner, gaining an award for her role as Matilda. For a second year in a row, actress Hannah Waddingham will be hosting the awards. She is best known for playing Richmond FC owner Rebecca Welton in Apple TV+ comedy Ted Lasso, which won her an Emmy, a Critics' Choice Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. The star, from south London, has also been in Game of Thrones and Sex Education, and was a fan favourite when she co-hosted last year's Eurovision Song Contest. Before making her breakthrough on screen, she was a leading lady on stage in the West End and on Broadway. The ceremony starts at 18:00, but there will be a TikTok live stream from the green carpet from 16:30 on the Official London Theatre's channel. A highlights package from the evening will be broadcast on ITV1 at 22:10. And you can listen live to coverage of the awards ceremony on Magic radio. Throughout the ceremony, there will be performances from several nominees including The Little Big Things, Next To Normal, Operation Mincemeat, A Strange Loop, Guys & Dolls and Hadestown. Awards will be presented by actors including Freema Agyeman, Adrian Dunbar, Anna Maxwell Martin and Dominic West. Ruth Jones and Beverley Knight, both currently starring in Sister Act, will also present awards. Model and actor Cara Delevingne, who is playing Sally Bowles in Cabaret, and Michael Sheen, who plays Nye Bevan in the National Theatre's Nye, are handing out awards as well. The Olivier Awards are the theatre equivalent of the Baftas or Brits. They are the most prestigious stage honours in the UK and recognise performances across theatre, opera and dance in the West End. The awards have been running since 1976 and were originally known as the Society of West End Theatre Awards. In 1984, British theatre actor Laurence Olivier gave his consent to have the awards renamed in recognition of his contribution to British theatre. The judging panel is put together by the Society of London Theatre and is comprised of industry professionals and members of the public who love theatre. The record for the most wins by one show is held by Harry Potter And The Cursed Child which picked up nine awards in 2017. The most awarded musical is split by Matilda, Hamilton and Cabaret which all have seven wins, while Dame Judi Dench holds the individual record for awards with eight.",4 days ago,entertainment
183,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg67q6w3vepo,Posters keeping local dialect alive in town,"A new poster campaign trying to keep a town's historic phrases alive has gone on display. The group Made in Maryport, along with Cumberland Council, has created colourful artwork which can be seen at the town's temporary Maritime Museum. Organisers say the work was inspired by the people of Maryport, their quirks, humour, and straight-talking attitude. Karen Thompson, one of the people behind the exhibition, said she was passionate about ""hanging on"" to local phrases. The designs were inspired by the Jus’ Git On Wid It Audio Adventure walking tours, which took place last summer. It explored local archive material and the unique character of Maryport. Now, organisers hope the posters can encourage people to use the dialect and start talking about Cumbria. Ms Thompson said she was discouraged from using her local dialect when she was in school and was told to speak ""properly"". She added her favourite phrase was ""git in amang it"", a phrase her father used when she was younger. She said it was used to encourage her to get up, get moving, and let her know she could do anything. Follow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

185,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmkn1jz4exo,Paisley artists facing biggest challenge in 150 years,"There has always been a close relationship between the Glasgow Art Club and the Paisley Art Institute. They’re both membership organisations which date back to the 19th century. They share many of the same members and a passion for the promotion of art and artists. But the connection has become even more vital as Paisley Art Institute (PAI) faces the biggest challenge in its 148 year history. The institute and Paisley Museum and Art Gallery were both founded in the same year and have been closely intertwined since. PAI has gathered a collection of more than 400 works including pieces by Sir John Lavery, Francis Cadell and Eugene Boudin. Paisley Museum’s collection includes many works by PAI members, bought during their regular exhibitions. PAI hoped their place in the new £45m Paisley Museum, due to open next year, would be just as generous. But when OneRen, the cultural and leisure arm of Renfrewshire Council offered the use of just one gallery, and display of 43 of their 400 strong historic collection, negotiations broke down. PAI is about to open its annual exhibition in the Glasgow Art Club. The works which are all for sale – are an eclectic mix by established members and new artists – but the institute also hopes to display some of its historic works, which are currently in storage in Paisley. Paisley Shawl, by Fra Newberry, the former director of Glasgow School of Art is top of the list. “Newberry was a member of both PAI and Glasgow Art Club, as are many of our current members,” says PAI president Joe Hargan. “His great granddaughter Denise Findlay has a piece in our new exhibition, just one of the many family connections between the clubs.” “I hope in the next week or two to be able to put that work up in this very gallery.” “We've also pencilled in for later on in the year, an exhibition of the Paisley art collection, alongside the Glasgow Art Club’s historic works.” Although the move could allow for some shared costs and savings, it’s also likely to be expensive and PAI may have to take drastic action to pay their share. “It has already been expensive with all the legal costs over the last year and a half,” says Joe Hargan. “There will be huge insurance premiums and we have to think creatively how we can sustain as much as we can of our collection. ""We may have to shed some of it because it's just going to be too onerous to be able to keep going so it's thrown up whole new problems but at the same time, with the art club and other organisations we can hopefully begin a new chapter.” The last few years have been turbulent, and some members of the 300 strong organisation have stepped away but he says there is support for a radical approach. “You don’t always get members to turn up to everything but those who’ve been at AGMS have been unanimous in accepting that in a difficult situation, we may need to take difficult decisions and that may mean shedding some of the paintings. ""It’s definitely a new start, a fresh chapter. We would have preferred not to have been thrown into this situation, but we must try and salvage what we can out of a bad situation.” Robert Ferguson is president of the Glasgow Art Club. “There are lots of complications, but I think the most important thing is to offer somewhere that the art can be displayed,"" he says. ""Somewhere that everyone in the west of Scotland has the opportunity to come to. ""A lot of that very special collection that the Paisley art Institute has, has been in storage for years. ""It's not been on the walls so that means there'll be another chance to be able to see it.” Paisley Museum say they’ve engaged with PAI since 2016 and their offer to integrate their collection into the new space as well as use of a large, prominent gallery space for their exhibition was declined. “We wish PAI well and hope everyone can enjoy the treasures they have in their care,” said a spokesman. “Our curatorial team are sad to see the collection go. It is part of the story we are trying to tell in the new museum.” “OneRen is working with PAI to enable the safe transfer of their collection items and it is up to them to decide how to give the public access to those artworks in future.”",5 days ago,entertainment

Imogen Wade's poem, based on her real-life experience of being abducted in New York, triumphed over 19,000 entries at the National Poetry Competition. Wade, from Harlow, Essex, said winning was ""very surprising"". The poet also joked that the prize of £5,000 meant she had made back her money from being mugged aged 19. ""It's been incredible; I'm really, really, happy about this and it's not at all something I expected,"" she told BBC Upload with Rob Jelly on Thursday. ""When they called me up, I behaved like a moron, really. ""I said 'Oh my God' about seven times and then after the call I had to email them and say 'Oh sorry, I blanked out on the phone call can you repeat what you said so I can have it in writing?' ""It was really, really embarrassing."" Wade was one of 8,841 poets from 110 different countries entering the competition, together submitting 19,000 poems. The competition, hosted by The Poetry Society, recognises unpublished works. She said her grandfather and the poem When You Are Old by William Butler Yeats had inspired her as a child, and teachers at school had also influenced her. When she is not putting pen to paper, Wade works as a therapist. She explained how she was on strong travel sickness medication while studying in New York when ""I just find myself"" locked in a van under a ""dark bridge"". ""I'm like 'Oh no, this is the end of my life, it's been a good ride' and then luckily didn't die and lived to write the poem,"" Wade said.

187,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd13y9l51kpo,The 'unsung hero' of Saturday Night Takeaway,"Presenters Ant and Dec have described their warm-up man as the ""unsung hero"" of their Saturday Night Takeaway show as it takes a break after 22 years. Andy Collins, 53, who has worked on the show since it begun in 2002, said his job was to ""whip the crowd into a frenzy"" in the hour before it was broadcast live. Declan Donnelly told the BBC that Collins was ""a genuine unsung hero of the show’s success"" while Ant McPartlin said he ""gets the party rocking"". The warm-up man, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said he would miss the programme, adding: ""I will go home and be gutted."" He said: ""I've grown up working on that show, we've had ups and downs and I've made some really good friendships."" Collins, who has also presented a breakfast show on BBC Three Counties Radio since 2016, said: ""I think we've all grown up together, we've all got older, and some of us have got bigger because the catering's so good."" He left school when he was 15, joined the navy at 16 and, when he returned to civilian life in his 20s, began to learn his craft performing in holiday camps. ""I got a phone call from somebody, they needed a children's warm-up and asked if I had done it before. I lied - got the job,"" he laughed. Collins worked as a warm-up man on shows including Gladiators, GamesMaster and Blind Date in the late 1990s and early 2000s. ""If you had a prime-time show and you wanted it to be good, you booked me,"" he said. ""That sounds incredibly big-headed. Don't get me wrong; I had to work hard to build up that reputation. I had to make sacrifices."" Collins continues to provide warm-up for big shows such as Britain's Got Talent, The Jonathan Ross Show and Ant and Dec's Limitless Win. Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway has drawn millions of viewers every week since its launch. Collins believes that success is down to how it appeals to the whole family. ""It is the very few shows that you can watch with your mum, your dad, your nan, your granddad, your uncle Brian and your auntie Irene,"" he said. It has also attracted big guests for its features, including elaborate pranks played on  Simon Cowell, a live performance by Robbie Williams and a special appearance from Star Wars actor Mark Hamill. ""When we have the punters on, Joe Public, they're as important as Luke Skywalker, and that's the gift - that's the joy of the show,"" said Collins. Collins first met the Geordie presenting duo when he did the warm-up for their 1999 BBC One show Friends Like These. The father-of-two said: ""They are very good friends; we go on golfing holidays. Over those 20 years we have stuck together as friends. ""I think friendship and loyalty are very important and we don't take that for granted. ""Not just the boys - the crew, the cast... not just the celebs, Alan Conley, you won't know them, they work behind the scenes but it is real good friendships and [with the show ending] that's gone now."" Collins also attributes the success of the ITV show to how hard the duo work, not just as presenters but also as producers. He said: ""The boys are very professional, they work hard and they expect you to work hard, so I take criticism from them very seriously. ""Series four, show five, Ant said to me 'That audience was a bit flat' and I decided that will never happen again. ""We are now on series 20 and I make sure that audience is never flat. ""I'm very critical about this show, more than any other show. I watch the dress rehearsals and I watch it as a punter so [Ant and Dec] watch for my reactions."" Ant and Dec told the BBC how important Collins had been to the show. McPartlin said: “Andy has been integral to the show's success over the years. ""The Saturday Night Takeaway audiences are unique as everyone comes to have a party on a Saturday night. Andy understands this completely and gets the party rocking!"" Reflecting on the last 20 years, Donnelly added: “He’s been there since day one and been as important to the show's success as anyone who has appeared on screen. ""He’s a genuine unsung hero of the show’s success and we’d like to keep it that way because we think he will get a terribly big head and put his rates up.” McPartlin joked: ""He’s a great warm-up guy, a great friend but terrible golfer.""

Art gallery visitors in Guildford will be able to try out headsets which give a 3D display of the effect that different works have on our brains. Visitors will be able to see their own brainwaves at the town's Watts Gallery and Artists' Village on 14 April. The project, run by Art Fund, the UK’s national charity for art, aims to solve the question of the fundamental value of art and the impact it has on individuals. Research commissioned to accompany the initiative found that one in six people believe that art has no impact on them at all. Art Fund says the technology demonstrates the ""clear and immediate impact"" art can have on the human brain, and how varied artworks may impact differently. Visitors to Watts Gallery of all ages will be able to view art or artefacts while wearing a headset that is connected to an electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor. The outputs of their brainwaves as they react to the art are visualised on-screen in 3D and real-time. See what your brain does when you look at art Art Fund director Jenny Waldman said: ""This technology shows how art can improve our wellbeing and emotions.

189,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68706853,Thomas Dambo: Sperrin Mountains 'fairy tale' setting for trolls,"""Where I'm from, we don't really have hills, so when I saw Northern Ireland, it was like a fairy tale setting for my art."" Thomas Dambo is one of the world's leading recycle artists. Enthusiasm beams from the 44-year-old from Denmark when he speaks about his sculptures. In recent years he has become best known for his work on The Trail of a Thousand Trolls. It is a project that consists of more than 100 large, recycled wood sculptures featuring trolls of all shapes and sizes. The sculptures have been installed in 17 countries, from the USA and France to Chile and China. Four trolls have recently made the island of Ireland's largest mountain range their home. The Sperrin Mountains stretch across Mid Ulster for more than 40 miles, through County Tyrone and County Londonderry. The mountains have strong links to ancient Celtic myths and Neolithic giants, so the world-renowned artist said it was a perfect location. He said: ""In Denmark we have troll legends, I grew up with troll lullabies, so we say things like - 'this lake is the footstep of a troll', so it was very natural for to me to use them in my sculptures. ""I had seen the landscape of Northern Ireland in movies and things like that, so I just felt it would be a beautiful place to have my art."" Dambo was taught the value of recycling and sustainability from a young age. He said the larger-than-life sculptures are a way of showcasing these values. He added: ""As a child, my parents always taught me to be good to nature and the value of recycling. I always loved to explore, climbing trees and things like that. ""I wanted to do street art and the sculptures came from there."" Derry City and Strabane, Fermanagh and Omagh, as well as Mid Ulster district councils have worked in partnership to develop what has become known as the Sperrin Sculpture Trail. The four troll sculptures are based at three different locations across the Sperrins. Two storyteller trolls lie in the Glenelly Valley, the guardian troll has made the Mullaghcarn Mountain its home and the stargazer troll resides in Davagh Forest near Northern Ireland's Dark Sky Park . But the giant link to the Sperrins does not begin and end with the large sculptures. The Mid Ulster area of Northern Ireland has previously been identified as a 'giant hotspot' by scientists studying a gene defect which causes people to grow abnormally tall. One in 150 people in Mid Ulster were found to carry AIP - known as the 'giant gene'. It can result in too much growth hormone, which is produced and released by the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland just below the brain. Geneticists have identified that living carriers of the gene in Mid Ulster shared a common ancestor who lived about 2,500 years ago. Dr Liam Campbell is a historical geographer and has given tours explaining this history of the Sperrins. He said: ""The Sperrins are like the spine of Northern Ireland and the sculptures are incredible because they're in the heart of them and represent all of that wonder of the mountains. ""The mythology of Ireland includes these stories of tribes of giants, so the sculptures are representing the natural and cultural heritage of the Sperrins."" Mary McKeown of Mid Ulster District Council said the location was stunning. ""Take the Dark Sky Park here at Davagh forest, where we have our stargazer troll, Ceoldán, based at. ""This is where archaeology meets astronomy, Ceoldán looks up into the stars and it entices you to look up and he has become the guardian of Davagh forest."" Dambo hasn't been back to Northern Ireland since his sculptures were installed but said he planned to visit as soon as he can. ""I would love to come back and see them because the sculptures are my little babies - or maybe I should say, my big babies,"" he said.",5 days ago,entertainment
190,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-68770359,North Yorkshire artist plants woodland to honour Sycamore Gap tree,"A North Yorkshire artist, who painted the Sycamore Gap tree, has started planting trees for every print copy she sells. Lucy Pittaway, based near Richmond, said she was ""inundated with requests"" for artwork of the tree, following its felling in September last year. She has so far sold nearly 2,400 prints and planted 600 new and mature trees. The artist hoped a new woodland would revive the Swinton Estate, where diseased trees recently faced felling. The 20,000 acre Swinton Estate, near Masham, is privately owned and includes the Swinton Park Hotel and cookery school. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the 49-year-old spoke of her connection with the single sycamore tree - which stood in a gap on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland. ""It is just a place that I recall from being a child, when I visited on a school trip,"" she said. ""In fact, my teenage twins had visited the area not long before it was felled. ""We were all just extremely moved by what had happened. Like everyone else, we were rather upset at how it had spoiled an iconic location."" Ms Pittaway explained she was apprehensive to paint the tree at first, saying she ""didn't want to be seen to capitalise on a tragedy"" but the large number of requests encouraged her to go forward. However, she felt as though she needed to ""give back"" in some way during the project. ""I was very keen to donate from the sale of the original painting but I wanted to find another way of doing something much more exciting,"" she said. ""One of the team members said, 'how about we plant a tree for every print we have sold' and I said that it was an absolutely brilliant idea."" The total sales have almost reached 2,400 copies, which would see a large woodland be planted on the Swinton Estate, next to the 200-year-old Druid's Temple. In April, Lucy and her team went out to plant the first 600 trees, which were mainly sycamore along with oak, rowan, hazel and other native trees. The area welcomed the new additions, after undergoing widespread felling when a fungal disease swept across the larch trees. The pathway to the Lucy Pittaway Sycamore Gap Trail would be formed by chippings from the felled trees on a woodland walk, which would also feature artistic installations, areas to relax and education boards. The artist added: ""I've been overwhelmed with the response. There's been a lot of emotion around the tree being felled and people have bought the painting for that reason - they've either visited the site or it meant something to them in another way. ""Hopefully the woodland is going to be a space where people can enjoy and see regeneration, new trees and where there was once diseased trees that have been felled.""

191,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-68734853,Stolen Cambridge museum jade still missing 12 years later,"Police have said they are no longer actively looking for millions of pounds worth of jade stolen from a university museum 12 years ago. Thieves made off with 18 mainly jade items after breaking in to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge on 13 April 2012. The artefacts, dating from the Ming and Qing dynasties and worth millions of pounds, have never been recovered. Cambridgeshire Police said the recovery operation was no longer ""active"". Fourteen members of a gang were jailed in 2016 for co-ordinating the thefts of the Chinese items and rhino horn - valued at about £57m - taken between November 2011 and April 2012 in various raids in Cambridge, Durham, Norwich and Lewes, East Sussex. The art was taken from the University of Cambridge's museum at about 19:30 BST in a raid carried out inside a few minutes. Art theft expert Christopher Marinello, a lawyer and founder of private company Art Recovery International, has been following the fallout of the Fitzwilliam theft. ""It's been disappointing that nothing has been recovered,"" Mr Marinello said. ""We fully expect these items have been embedded in the Chinese market and we probably won't see them again in our lifetime. ""None of them have hit the marketplace as these things usually do."" Mr Marinello's team scours websites, databases and places where art is bought and sold, but ""we've never come across them"", Mr Marinello says. ""Thieves quickly try to monetise such things. ""Once they are in Asia, you can quickly say goodbye to seeing them again."" The Fitzwilliam items were likely purchased by private Chinese collectors as ""the Chinese market loves jade"", he said. ""This isn't a case of repatriation of cultural heritage. In my view these items were stolen by common thugs who had Chinese buyers,"" Mr Marinello explained. ""People sometimes romanticise art theft - but it's just for cash - they had a buyer."" Mr Marinello does not believe any of the Fitzwilliam items are likely to surface ""until a relative of whoever has them decides they don't like jade and wants to sell - but that won't be anytime soon"". In 2016, following the sentencing of the art thefts gang, the then-director of the museum, Tim Knox, seemed optimistic the artefacts could be retrieved. Mr Knox said at the time: ""They're very well-known. They're impossible to sell on the open market. ""I have every confidence that they'll eventually come back to us. They're probably under someone's bed to tell you the truth."" However, a spokesperson from the Fitzwilliam Museum declined to comment on whether it was still looking for the items 12 years after they were taken. They told the BBC: ""The theft of the jade from the Fitzwilliam Museum is still a live, open case and as such we wouldn't be able to comment."" Cambridgeshire Police confirmed the case was still open, but added: ""While this case isn't active, we will investigate any further lines of inquiry should they come to light in the future.""

192,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68798482,Zendaya: How she's perfected the art of method dressing,"Getting into character is something that can be all-encompassing for an actor when they're on set. There are accents to perfect, facial expressions to master and sometimes a completely new look thanks to clothes, make up and hair. But ever increasingly, Hollywood's biggest stars are extending their roles to the red carpet too. Zendaya's recent looks have all playfully toyed with the tennis theme of her new film, Challengers. Matching your fashion to your film role is known as method dressing, which Zendaya referenced in her BBC One Show interview on Thursday. ""Fashion is something I've always used as an outlet, a tool - ultimately, I think I am a more shy person so it allows for me to create this persona, this character that I get to live in for the day,"" she said. Zendaya said she first started method dressing after starring in The Greatest Showman and was ""inspired by the film"". Her playful take on the protagonist of the film's style was an important moment and showed an understanding of what the movie was trying to achieve. The musical, which was inspired by entertainer PT Barnum's life, paid careful attention to detail in its 800 costumes, with designer Ellen Mirojnick saying at the time that the brief was ""fashionable, accessible and modern"", something Zendaya was able to mirror in her look. ""We get so lucky to be part of films with such rich references anyway, so might as well pull from that,"" Zendaya told the One Show. The 27-year-old has since created a number of film-themed looks with her stylist Law Roach, for films such as Dune and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Her looks could have easily appeared more fancy dress than fashion - but Zendaya and Roach have perfected her signature style after working together for more than 13 years. ""I always try to be a storyteller more than anything else, and this is such a strong story to tell,"" Roach recently told Vogue after finishing the press tour for Dune 2. ""The looks served as an extension of the wardrobe from the movie. It was intentional and purposeful,"" he added. For fashion journalist Chloe Burney, she says ""dressing in character mode on the red carpet isn't just an homage to actors' recently completed projects, but is also injecting heaps of fun"". She tells the BBC she ""wouldn't typically gravitate"" towards Challengers but ""Zendaya's tennis-themed looks have got us all talking"". Ms Burney's favourite looks from the press run have been Zendaya's Loewe tennis ball stilettos and custom glitter green gown. We've seen a number of Hollywood stars give method dressing a go in the last few months - Margot Robbie being one of the standouts. Her Barbie looks have mirrored several of her character's costumes from the film, with some even borrowing from iconic dolls too. Ms Burney says these looks have helped ""bring cultural relevance to a project"". ""I lost count of how many shop windows turned pink overnight,"" she added. It's not just something female stars are enjoying too - Ryan Gosling leaned into the spirit of Barbie with his red carpet looks - which proved once and for all that pink is a colour that works for everyone. Bringing more fun to red carpets is something that actor and director Sofia Coppola was crying out for in 2018. Writing in W Magazine , she wrote: ""Looking at some photos from a recent red-carpet event the other night, I couldn't help but think what a bummer it has all become. ""You can't tell the women apart—there's a stream of bland red-carpet editions of them,"" she added. She complained that ""Everyone looks the same, with perfect grooming, gowns, and brand-new jewellery, as they parade a catalogue of luxury items,"" - it would be interesting to know what Coppola's take on the new red carpet trends are. Timothée Chalamet wore a dazzling lilac jumpsuit to the Wonka world premiere. His look for the Charlie and the Chocolate factory remake turned him into a human version of the famous chocolate bar. Jenna Ortega channelled Halloween chic whilst promoting Netflix hit Wednesday. Several members of the cast played with method dressing on the press tour, but Ortega's high fashion take on a corpse bride for the world premiere was a highlight. The entire cast of The Batman and several guests successfully got on board with method dressing at the film's 2022 premiere. Robert Pattinson wore an all-black suit and overcoat to replicate the look of his character, Bruce Wayne, but the standout outfit was Zoë Kravitz's. She played Catwoman, choosing a black Oscar de la Renta dress with a cool cat corset. Attention to detail is key for method dressing - something that Carey Mulligan took seriously when promoting Maestro. She plays Felicia Bernstein, wife of the conductor Leonard Bernstein and whilst promoting the film wore several replicas of 1950s dresses to reflect when Maestro was set. For the Oscars red carpet she donned a stunning fishtail gown, recreating an original design from 1951 - the year that Felicia and Leonard Bernstein got married.",5 days ago,entertainment

The fashion house that bears his name announced the death on Instagram but provided no details. Italian news agency ANSA reported that he died at home in Florence after a long illness. He set up his company in the 1970s. His designs have been worn by stars like Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren, Kim Kardashian, and Jennifer Lopez. Roberto Cavalli's creative director, Fausto Puglisi, said the designer would continue to be seen as ""a beacon of inspiration for others."" In a post on the fashion house's Instagram page , Mr Puglisi said working with Cavalli was ""the greatest honour of my career"". Cavalli was born on 15 November 1940 in Florence, known for its leatherwork. After launching his namesake fashion brand in 1970, he later invented and patented an innovative leather printing process. Cavalli opened his first small shop, Limbo, in the French city of Saint-Tropez in 1972. As well as animal prints, he was also known for his hippie dresses, sand-blasted jeans, and patchwork designs on denim. In 2005 he was tapped to update the Playboy Bunnies' scanty uniform, and even introduced one version in leopard print. When asked what inspired him to use animal prints in his designs, Cavalli told Vogue in a 2011 interview: ""I like everything that is of nature."" He went on to tell the magazine: ""I started to appreciate that even fish have a fantastic coloured 'dress', so does the snake, and the tiger. I start[ed] to understand that God is really the best designer, so I started to copy God."" The founder of Armani, Giorgio Armani, was among those to pay tribute to the late designer, saying his ""Tuscan verve"" would be missed. In statement posted on Armani's social media accounts, he said: ""Roberto was a true artist, wild and wonderful in his use of prints, capable of transforming fantasy into seductive clothes.""",6 days ago,entertainment
194,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd13nd31zpyo,Documentary made about doodle artist,"A Kent artist at the heart of a new documentary says the film is “my favourite thing I’ve ever been involved in”. Sam Cox, known as Mr Doodle, rose to fame after he covered every inch of his Tenterden home with doodle art. His popularity soared internationally after his videos on social media racked up millions of views. The documentary, titled The Trouble with Mr Doodle, explores his obsession with doodling and his personal struggles. “I don’t really share much personal stuff on social media, as I usually keep it to just doodles and everything is happy,” he said. “But the process of making the film was really therapeutic to me. “Through my life it hasn’t always been pure joy. And a lot of that has gone into the film. “But now I’m able to navigate my way through life with a better understanding of who I am.” In 2020, Mr Doodle was the world's fifth most successful artist aged under 40 at auction. Jaimie D’Cruz, the director of the documentary, said he had first planned to make a documentary about Mr Cox’s home. “But the first time I met Sam and went into that house, I found it completely overwhelming, and I thought we needed to make the film represent that experience,” he said. “The film tries to create the experience of what it is like to be Sam and be consumed by this need to constantly doodle, but also for us to understand what that might be like.” Mr D’Cruz previously directed Academy Award-nominated documentaries Exit Through The Gift Shop and Black Sheep.

195,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240412-challengers-review-a-lot-of-sport-a-lot-of-wigs-and-a-lot-of-sexual-tension-in-luca-guadagninos-menage-tennis,"Challengers review: 'A lot of sport, a lot of wigs and a lot of sexual tension' in Luca Guadagnino's menage à tennis","Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist are a love triangle in a tennis drama with ""a lot of sport, a lot of wigs and a lot of sexual tension"" – but not enough psychological intrigue. Luca Guadagnino's menage à tennis has a lot of sport, a lot of wigs and a lot of sexual tension. It has three amazingly talented actors, with Zendaya as one point in a shifting romantic triangle, and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist as the men competing for her affection. And Guadagnino's previous dazzling depictions of romance include a gay teenager's first love in Call Me by Your Name (2017) and young cannibals in Bones and All (2022), so the pieces are all in place here for an intense, erotic drama set in the world of professional tennis. Yet Challengers feels more like a film trying to be those things than one that achieves its goal. Perfectly pleasant to watch, it never becomes thoroughly engrossing, as the characters often slip from enigmatic to thinly-written. It isn't bad, but it is underwhelming. Challengers was meant to open the Venice Film Festival last September, but was pulled due to the actors' strike. It's easy to see why that made sense. The actors keep the film going, at times by sheer magnetic on-screen presence even when the screenplay lets them down. The story begins in 2019, with former best friends Art (Faist, Riff in West Side Story ) and Patrick (O'Connor, Charles as a young man in The Crown ) now professional players in slumps, entered in a second-tier Challenger tournament in suburban New York. Art, rich from his previous success, needs to restore his confidence. Patrick, who comes from a privileged family yet is obstinately sleeping in his car, needs a win to qualify for bigger tournaments. Zendaya, who proved how good she can be in Euphoria, plays Tashi, a teenage phenomenon as a player until she was injured. Now she is Art's wife and coach, but it doesn't sound great for them when he says ""Hey, I love you"" and she coolly says ""Yeah, I know"". The film flashes back and forth in time, revealing their tangled history while heading toward the inevitable final match between the two rivals. That structure sounds promising, but here it simply slows the momentum. The scenes set 13 years before, when Tashi and the men meet at a juniors tournament, are the liveliest, with the actors at ease in the roles. Patrick is the charmer with a roguish smile, which O'Connor uses to good effect throughout the film. His character also has the most irreverent lines, adding a dash of humour. Art is the sensitive, understanding type, but Faist shows that he's not a pushover. Zendaya is especially nuanced when playing the younger Tashi, who seems like the most wholesome teenager around, but is actually daring and wily. When the men invite her to their shared hotel room, she goes. The trailer makes a point of showing the three of them sitting on a bed, kissing, and in the film that scene works extremely well to set up tension, as we wonder how far any of them will go. Fair warning: that teasing sexuality is an anomaly, not the norm. Remember, Guadagnino is the director who put Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer in bed together in Call Me by Your Name, then discreetly turned the camera to look out the window at a tree. In one of the screenplay's shrewdest turns, Tashi sets up a contest that would have been thoroughly toxic if one of the men had suggested it. Art and Patrick are set to play against each other the next day, and whoever wins will get her phone number, she says. It's the kind of subversive, unexpected twist the film could have used much more of.  A few years later, Tashi is in college, where she suffers her career-changing injury, Patrick is her boyfriend and Art is pining away. O'Connor told Empire magazine about the film, ""The tennis is the sex"", which is a great quote, and also... no. The tennis is the tennis and the sex is the sex. They never really come together, even when Tashi starts talking about tennis when she's beginning to have sex with Patrick in her dorm room. But there is a definite electricity between Tashi and bad-boy Patrick that she does not have with safe, good-guy Art. More like this: The one thing that Back to Black gets so right Civil War's warning about the US political divide The paranoid thriller more relevant than ever The actors dash around the tennis court, but it is kind of shocking that Guadagnino uses some stale sports-movie tropes, including a slo-mo walk down a corridor to the court outside, and spectators at a match turning their heads right then left then right again in unison. The tropes may be used knowingly but they still look clichéd. And there is a thunderous Thwack! whenever anyone hits a tennis ball. One of the best surprises turns out to be the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, a propulsive techno score that does a lot of the work to keep the tennis scenes moving. As the years go on there is betrayal and subterfuge all around, in scenes that surface here and there almost glancingly. More of the psychological intrigue would have helped. And the liveliness of the early scenes dissipates. By the end, Art is a depressed noodle. Zendaya spends the final stretch looking stern, although she does play the last tricky scenes very well, as we are led to question what Tashi's motives are when she makes another audacious move. In the last tennis match, the camera swishes around so fast the screen looks like an abstract image. For a few enlivening seconds, there is a glimpse of a bolder, better version of Challengers lurking behind the competent, uninspired film we have. ★★★☆☆ Challengers is released on 26 April.

196,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68798385,Oasis release live Belfast track for Supersonic anniversary,"They played to 250,000 fans at Knebworth and sold out Maine Road twice, but 30 years ago Oasis rocked a much smaller stage in Northern Ireland. The Manchester indie-rockers' debut single 'Supersonic' was released this week in 1994 and that song, recorded live at the Limelight in Belfast, has been re-released to celebrate the anniversary. Rewind to September 1994, when Oasis' debut album 'Definitely Maybe' went to Number 1 in the UK Charts. It was on that very same night, Sunday 4 September, that the band was making their Belfast debut. As a celebration of the 30th anniversary of 'Supersonic,' not only have Oasis re-released the single on all streaming platforms, they have also released a rare live take of the single, captured on that night in The Limelight in Belfast back in 1994. You can hear the full story of how this monumental night shaped up on The Stephen McCauley Show on BBC Sounds. Gigs were very different in the 1990s. They were an undocumented snapshot in time. A moment between you and the artist that when done right, lives forever. In 1994, the foundations of the music landscape were shaking, as on the ashes on the American grunge movement a new guitar wave was rising, and all bets were on Oasis being the future rock-n-roll stars of 'Brit Pop'. A few hours before the band took the stage in Belfast word came that their debut album 'Definitely Maybe' had gone straight into the UK album chart at Number 1. Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher remembers the night fondly. ""Limelight is now part of our heritage. There was a great buzz when the owner informed me we had hit the number one spot that night in '94. ""I'll always remember this place with affection. We had a party that night and the audience joined in. That was the start of our success story."" Gig goers remember guitarist Bonehead, with brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, being amongst the crowd that night, signing autographs before the performance and talking to fans as they came in. Liam even telling people to look out for the song 'Supersonic'. ""It's deadly,"" he told them. It was a night of anthems. Anthems now of course, but as underground hits from the now number one debut album such as 'Supersonic', 'Live Forever' and 'Cigarettes and Alcohol' poured through the speakers in the small venue that night, rock and roll music changed forever. David Neely was the booker and general manager for The Limelight in Belfast at that time and recalls that the doors opened at 19:00 for the 500 capacity venue - although thousands now claim to have been there - and that tickets were only £6.75. ""The Limelight show was the right venue, for the right band at the right time. The atmosphere was electric,"" he said. For the hundreds who were there, this release provides a portal back to a certain specialness that gets lost seeing big bands in the vastness of stadiums. For everyone else it was a Supersonic moment, recorded at a time when you could look into the whites of the eyes of the performers on stage. It was you and them. No phones to block your view. Despite it being an iconic night for both Belfast and Oasis, no one knew the gig was recorded that night, not even the audio engineer on the night. However, this release does show at least some of it was recorded by the band, which split in 2009.",6 days ago,entertainment

200,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240409-how-much-it-costs-to-attend-coachella,How much it costs to attend Coachella,"The annual music festival in the California desert draws thousands of people to see some of the world's biggest acts. Tickets are expensive – but the Coachella experience can be priceless. In the US's vast landscape of music festivals, Coachella is in a league of its own. Held in the Southern California desert, it draws an annual attendance of nearly 650,000 across two weekends in April, making it the largest music festival in the country . This year, the three-day event begins on 12 April and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend. Many of them are repeat attendees who describe a meticulously well-organised and picturesque adult playground in the Coachella Valley, brought to life by an eclectic roster of artists, who often go the extra mile for the premier event. (Think surprise guest performances , reunions , new music debuts and even a hologram of the late rap legend Tupac Shakur .) Many people are willing to lay out a lot of money for the experience and party in the VIP section, but it's possible to get by on a budget, too. Compared to the past 11 times he's attended, Harry Levin is finding this year's festival logistics more complicated. The former Los Angeles resident used to be able to drive to the Coachella Valley, but this time he's flying in from his new home in Denver, Colorado. The freelance writer was more into electronic dance music (EDM) festivals before attending his first Coachella in 2013, when he couldn't pass up the chance to see Southern California's own Red Hot Chilli Peppers headline the event. ""If you had seen me and my friends, you'd think we're the weird guys everyone's avoiding because they're having too much fun. But to be honest, that's how I feel about music inside all the time,"" he says. ""Coachella was the first place I felt like I could truly express that."" Levin, who likens the event to a ""religious experience"" for music lovers, no longer camps out at the festival, as he did his first five years. This year he's flying into LA, where he'll spend the Wednesday before the festival gates open at his father's house, then drive about 125 miles (201km) south-east to the venue the next morning. That leaves two nights at a hotel, if he drives back to his dad's at the end of the festival on Sunday night. Levin says the flight will cost about $200 (£158), the hotel will be about $440 (£348), and he'll need to rent a car for about $250 (£198). He's also budgeting about $120 (£95) worth of petrol and $350 (£277) for food and drinks, and has already purchased his $560 (£445) general admission weekend pass. As for the culture, Levin encourages the uninitiated not to be discouraged by constant complaints that the event has catered too much to social media influencers over the real music lovers. ""Don't let the haters affect your experience,"" he says. ""If you're just going to hang out and listen to tunes, you will have the best time."" For 32-year-old Michael Luis, what makes Coachella special are the once-in-a-lifetime moments in music history. His first experience in 2012 didn't disappoint, giving the then 20-year-old the opportunity to see two of his favourite bands – At the Drive-in and Refused – reunite on stage, along with resurrection of Tupac in hologram form. ""I quickly realized it was more than just a music festival – it's more of a cultural event,"" he says. That year the Canadian communications professional from British Columbia says the whole experience cost him less than $1,200 (£950). That's because he and three friends split the 22-hour drive south in a single vehicle, and intentionally arrived early to snag a campsite close to the front gates. That enabled them to avoid spending on concessions, returning to the campsite for food and drinks throughout the weekend. ""If you're smart with it, and you spend your money on the right things, you can do it quite affordably – especially if you're a California local or even live within a 12-hour drive."" For his sixth time visiting this year, however, Luis says he and three friends are spending about $400 (£317) each on flights, splitting a rental car for about $250 (£198) a piece and bringing camping gear from home. Combined with a $560 ticket to the festival, a $150 (£119) parking pass and $100 (£79) per day for food and alcohol, he expects the whole experience to run him about $1,760. He argues it's an incredible value. ""Seeing just the headliners at an arena show will cost you $300 to $400 each,"" he says. Luis adds that Coachella has an unfortunate reputation for being a playground for the privileged, and emphasises the event can suit a range of budgets. ""People have a misconception that it's this party in the desert for California's wealthy elite,"" he says. ""When you go to the campgrounds, it's a lot of students, working class people, eating peanut butter sandwiches, just wanting to see the bands they like with their friends."" For Elena Suarez, the cost of renting a house and getting a VIP pass is worth every penny. To the Los Angeles-based line producer, the event is about more than just music, and she wants to be comfortable and well rested while she and her friends soak it all in. She says Coachella is her favourite event on the calendar – she looks forward to it more than Christmas – and compares it to ""adult Disneyland"" or a late-spring break. Now, Suarez is just as excited for her 12th Coachella weekend as she was for her first in 2011. Before dropping $1,200 on a VIP pass, however, Suarez warns that the more expensive ticket won't get you a much better vantage point at headlining performances, as it does at other events. It will, however, save hours of waiting in lines; provide access to cleaner and less busy restrooms; and admission to Suarez's favourite corner of the sprawling venue, the Rose Garden. ""It feels like you're in a Parisian park, it's just so beautiful,"" she says. More in How Much It Costs: Suarez says she typically rents a home along with about 15 friends, where they spend their days before and after the festival barbecuing poolside, taking a dip in the hot tub and listening to the artists they'll see at the venue. The home they rent each year, which is about a mile and a half from the festival, costs about $1,400 (£1,109) per person with two to a room. Suarez says that in 2022, she spent about $3,250, which included $150 for a preferred parking spot and another $150 per person to split a minivan rental, plus groceries, accessories and other miscellaneous costs. That year, she also bought her ticket late and had to settle for the more expensive Tier 2 pricing, which ran her $1,400. But last year, those costs went down to about $2,700 when the group ditched the van and secured their VIP passes at the Tier 1 rate of about $1,200 with fees. ""If you rent a house and you don't have to rent a car, for VIP I'd say expect to spend $2,500 to $3,500,"" she says. For Hernán Montfort, Coachella is synonymous with good vibes. Since 2019, Mexico-based Montfort has taken an annual break from his day job in strategy at the Monterrey Institute of Technology to reunite with college friends – now dispersed around the globe – at the festival just north of the border. ""I like the positive vibe, and also as an engineer I really enjoy when something is really well organised – when the logistics go better than you expect,"" he says, describing the event like a well-oiled machine. Montfort jokes that each year he and his friend group, which has grown from five to 11 members over the years, swear that it will be their last – but inevitably purchase early-bird tickets as soon as they go on sale. Each time they return, he says costs run between $2,000 and $2,500, which includes the roughly $200 flight from Monterrey, Mexico; five nights in a hotel, at a cost of about $600 to $700 (£475 to £555) per person; about $100 to $150 on a rental van; festival passes; and other costs such as food, gas, clothing and accessories. ""You could spend around the same at an all-inclusive in the Caribbean, but I believe a festival and a trip like this is a super way to spend your money, to have a good time, and to make memories,"" he says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",6 days ago,entertainment
201,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68791738,"CinemaCon 2024: Gladiators, Deadpool and Dwayne Johnson dominate","The annual meeting of cinema - or movie theatre owners - as they're better known in the US, has been taking place in Las Vegas, where stars and executives showcase their latest productions. CinemaCon often has a huge number of talking points and this year has been no exception. There's been appearances from the likes of Ariana Grande and Dwayne Johnson and teaser trailers from upcoming releases such as Moana 2 and Joker: Folie à Deux. Walt Disney Studios had two major reveals for fans - unreleased clips from Deadpool and Wolverine plus Moana 2. Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman opened the presentation (albeit virtually) by appearing in a nine-minute extended trailer of the much-anticipated release. Those in attendance got a first look at Jackman's Wolverine, and were also treated so several jokes pointed towards Fox and even Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. After the disappointment of the Deadpool stars not being there in person, Disney made it up to the audience by bringing on none other than Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He joined in with a performance by Polynesian dancers and introduced a clip of Moana 2, in which he reprises his role as Maui. Paramount Pictures couldn't pass up the opportunity to share the first trailer of Gladiator II on the stage of The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The hotel's luxurious re-imagining of Ancient Rome looks pretty different to the one in Ridley Scott's new film though - which follows on from historical drama released in 2000. A star-studded cast of Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn appear in the all-action clip, with Mescal seen facing off against rhinos and baboons. Scott promised the film, which is scheduled for release in November, would be ""well worth the wait."" The boss of film studio Universal, Donna Langley, took a moment to reflect on her company's success in the last year - namely its film Oppenheimer being a box office and awards show hit. But she said ""that's not enough for us"" and said the studio had its best years ahead of it - despite the challenge cinemas are facing in getting people through the doors. One of Universal's announcements was a sequel to the globally successful Five Nights at Freddy's, which is set for an autumn 2025 release. The video game adaptation made £107m globally in its opening weekend , and the studio is hoping to replicate its success with the film's second helping. Luckily for Cynthia Erivo, who plays ""bad witch"" Elphaba in the forthcoming adaptation of the musical film Wicked, her appearance at CinemaCon didn't involve the character's signature green face paint. She was dressed in the colour though, keeping up the theme alongside co-star Ariana Grande, who plays Glinda the Good Witch and was appropriately dressed in pink. The pair were on stage to introduce an extended trailer of the film, which featured snippets of the songs Popular and Defying Gravity. ""We both felt such a tremendous responsibility to honour these women and to pour our hearts, our souls, our tears - so many different pairs of lashes,"" Grande said. Erivo added: ""I'm really grateful for this journey that we've taken together."" It's time to dust off your finest suit , because the release of Despicable Me 4 is coming soon. The franchise's third film caused chaos in UK cinemas back in 2022, and the boss of animator Illumination introduced some new characters entering the minion world. CinemaCon attendees got a first look at newcomers to the cast - Will Ferrell,  Sofia Vergara and Stephen Colbert. The film, which is out in July, follows Gru (played by Steve Carell) as he joins forces with Poppy (Joey King) to steal a honey badger, getting help from other minions and Gru's new baby son. Angel Studios, which was behind last year's controversial Sound of Freedom, which explored human trafficking and proved a big global box office success, predicted their next release, the Biblical epic David, will be the most successful animated film of all time. It's about David, the shepherd boy who battles the giant Goliath, and against the odds, slays him. Chief marketing officer Alex Nielsen announced that an initiative they brought in for Sound of Freedom, which allowed people to donate money to pay for tickets for others, would be brought back for this film. Nielsen estimated that it had helped almost two million people to see the film. Angel Studios boldly suggested they want this film to be the top-grossing animated film of all time. But to do that, it's going to have to beat the 2019 adaptation of The Lion King and earn more than $1.7bn worldwide. The trailer for the long-awaited sequel to Joker was shown for the first time, with fans getting a look at Lady Gaga's version of Harley Quinn. Joaquin Phoenix reprises the title role, for which he won an Oscar for in the original. The pair seemingly meet and fall in love in Arkham Asylum before apparently escaping and forming a musical duo. Director Todd Phillips said it isn't a musical, as had been rumoured, but that music is ""an essential element"".",6 days ago,entertainment

Factory Transmedia Ltd, based in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, has been put into a creditors' voluntary arrangement. The firm has produced a range of animations for Disney, Milkshake, Nick Jr, CBBC and CBeebies. Liquidators said ""challenging"" conditions in TV commissioning globally were a factor. The firm was part of the team behind a £5m revamp of The Clangers produced for CBeebies in 2015. The programme - created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin - originally aired in 1969. The reboot featured actor, comedian, presenter and writer Michael Palin as the narrator. Conrad Pearson and Patrick Lannagan, from international audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars, were appointed as joint liquidators of Factory Transmedia Ltd on 2 April. A spokesperson for Mazars said Factory Transmedia, which was incorporated in 2000, had built a reputation for production and creative excellence, employing hundreds of people. It specialised in a diverse range of animation-led projects, including Scream Street and Strange Hill High. The spokesperson added: ""Unfortunately, over the last 12 months the number of projects being green-lit by broadcasters around the world has been severely cut as the global economy and audience behaviours have changed markedly. ""These challenging market conditions were a significant factor in the insolvency of the business."" JPS Chartered Surveyors has been instructed to help sell off the company's assets via an online auction. Among the items being sold at the auction are puppets used for the Newzoids satirical sketch show which ran on ITV in 2015 and 2016, as well as studio equipment.

204,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68682965,Sum 41: Punk band promise last UK festival to be all killer no filler,"Almost 30 years after starting out, Sum 41's Deryck Whibley says he's amazed his music is still inspiring other artists. The multi-award winning punk band formed in 1996 and since sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. Their debut album, All Killer No Filler, included their best-selling single, Fat Lip, and propelled their brand of baggy jeans and spiky hair into the mainstream. Last year, the In Too Deep singer confirmed they would be disbanding after a final world tour - including their last major UK festival set at Download in June. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Deryck says they hadn't planned for their new album, Heaven :x Hell, to be their last but he thinks it's the best record for them to hang their hat on. ""The music basically told me, this is the last record,"" he says. ""This is a good one to go out on."" While their hairstyles might not be making a return, for some grassroot bands like rock trio Bilk, Sum 41's music is. Front-man Sol Abrahams, 24, says alongside Green Day, Nirvana and Oasis, Sum 41's had a huge impact on their music career. Being inspired by these bands ""keeps new music moving forward,"" he says. Sum 41's music has ""energy and an attitude to it in a happy, punky way,"" Sol, who performs alongside Luke Hare and Harry Gray, adds. ""I like that sort of juxtaposition. I take it into my music a lot."" Deryck says he is ""always surprised when he hears that"" from fans and other artists. ""Sometimes I don't really quite believe it but I think it's interesting. ""I love that there are a lot of punk rock bands, or pop punk bands, or just music, in that kind of world right now,"" says Deryck. ""And that this kind of music is doing really well for young new artists."" Deryck was 16 when he formed Sum 41, and there are some people discovering his music now at the same age as he was then. Despite the passage of time - and a hiatus which included a near-fatal alcohol related coma for Deryck - the band has managed to sustain its popularity, with 11.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify. And Deryck and the band can't help but reflect too. In a recent music video for their new song Waiting On A Twist Of Fate, the band reference their own inspirations with nods to Green Day and The Ramones. Now at 44, Deryck says the industry has changed drastically since they started out. ""We used to have MTV, that was so big and videos used to be so big. ""That was one of the biggest drivers of getting your music out there and that disappeared a long time ago,"" he says. The band will be playing Download Festival at Donington Park in Leicestershire in June, alongside headliners Fall Out Boy, Avenged Sevenfold and Queens of the Stone Age. ""We've been a part of it [Download] from the very, very early days,"" Deryck says. ""It's always a great audience. We're excited to be a part of it once again."" While they haven't planned their set list yet, Deryck, who's also a music manager and producer, tells Newsbeat they'll be playing the classics. ""The only thing I don't like to play is songs that nobody knows because that's boring for us and the audience."" The band hopes to stay relevant after parting ways next year. Deryck explains that it has always been about the music, not the fame. ""We've always just done what we do because we love it,"" he says. ""It's not that we don't love it anymore, it's just I'm ready to do something different."" Thinking of the legacy of their music, he says it ""always finds its way"". ""Good music always rises. So either we've written some good songs that will stand the test of time, or they won't."" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",6 days ago,entertainment
205,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68768274,Sir Ian McKellen: The actor on finally playing the role he always said no to in Player Kings,"Over the past six decades, Sir Ian McKellen has taken on the role of almost all of William Shakespeare's male protagonists, but there was one particular character he was ""never attracted to"" and always turned down. In a new West End production of Shakespeare's Henry IV parts one and two, Sir Ian has decided now is the time to take on the role of Falstaff, a character he describes as ""the ultimate gangster"". Player Kings has merged and condensed the two history plays to create one epic story. It focuses on the relationship between Hal, a young prince who will go on to be Henry V, and his friend, wayward criminal John Falstaff, as they navigate friendship, loyalty, and the clash between responsibility and revelry. Sir Ian told the BBC he had never felt ready to play the character of Falstaff when he was offered it in the past. ""Actors who have taken on the role say it is verbally very challenging - it seems that the role was written for a particular actor and comedian in Shakespeare's time, so it's a bit like being given a script for Michael McIntyre,"" he said. He explained that he almost turned down the the opportunity again, but was ""intrigued and eventually persuaded"" by director Robert Icke who has ""turned Falstaff into a believable character rather than an exaggeration"". Ted Lasso actor Toheeb Jimoh, who plays Prince Hal, said he was also drawn to Icke's adaptation because ""he wasn't sentimental about cutting out whatever doesn't translate to the audiences today"". ""Icke's a big believer that if Shakespeare was alive today he would be cutting and adapting his own work to make it more accessible,"" the 26-year-old actor added. Even after the ruthless slashing of the two texts, the play's running time is three-and-a-half hours, but the epic length does not worry the actors. ""To turn this play into bitesize chunks is to take away from the story. It is supposed to feel epic and expansive and so you need this length to give time to every part,"" Jimoh said. His co-star Richard Coyle who plays Henry IV added: ""I think it's a fallacy that you have to continuously hold someone's attention. I often want my attention to wander slightly because it's important to have that sense of drifting in and out. ""The best pieces of art are the ones where I am forced to reflect while I'm in it and the effect of engaging in something for a long period of time makes it more profound"". While the actors may be unconcerned by the running time, some theatre critics noted that the play was ""over-long"". In a three-star review from The Times , Clive Davis said that ""Icke's marathon modern-day Shakespeare production - which runs to nearly four hours - yields such mixed results."" He added that the in the first half of the evening, a full two hours long, the drama is at its sharpest, but ""after the interval, there's a sense of events being allowed to pile up almost at random"". Another three-star review by What's On Stage also referenced the ""staid"" second half ""where both Shakespeare's text and Icke's choices feel much more lacklustre and uninspired"". ""There may be mighty players, but this occasionally feels like less than the sum of its parts,"" Alex Wood said. In a four-star review, The Standard's Nick Curtis noted that Icke ""makes clear how these plays speak to our times: they ask what it means to be a man and a monarch, and whether we should dedicate our lives to duty or pleasure"". Making the play accessible to audiences and relevant to modern times was at the forefront of the actors minds, and for Sir Ian it was particularly important that young people engage with the show. ""I regret that young people aren't being taught enough about Shakespeare and I feel a responsibility as an actor as I believe we are the best people to teach them about his works."" Jimoh said he felt confident young people will relate to the play. ""It's all about a young man who is growing up, figuring out who they are and finding their own identity. As a young man myself I certainly relate to my character and I think many other people will as well."" He added that some of the words have been slightly changed to make it more understandable. ""The point of this show is that you can be totally new to Shakespeare and still follow what is going on."" Critics unanimously praised Jimoh's performance as the young prince - Time Out described the actor as ""fabulous"" and said he ""feels startlingly a piece with the vengeful older version of himself we meet in 'Henry V'"", while The Guardian said he ""plays the fun-loving prince well, as he is buffeted between a severe patriarch in King Henry and a wayward proxy father in Falstaff"". However, Arifa Akbar noted in her three-star review that ""the coming-of-age drama around Hal and his difficult journey towards royal duty feels slightly in the shadows"" because it is McKellen's character that steals the show. A four-star review from The Telegraph praised McKellen, and said his performance ""stirs the soul"" as he plunges ""from sackswilling, swaggering cheer to hangdog melancholy"". ""This account may not be one for the annals, but we surely exit eternally grateful that McKellen added the challenge to his bucket list; a must-witness,"" Dominic Cavendish wrote. After its run at London's Noel Coward theatre, the show will tour the country, something Sir Ian was very keen on. ""The play itself has so many settings across England, from the taverns of the East End to the rural peaceful countryside of Gloucestershire and so it only makes sense that we take this show all around, giving the opportunity to as many people as possible to see it.""",6 days ago,entertainment
206,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68778519,Sir Antony Gormley: Artist's iron men take over grounds of Norfolk stately home,"One hundred life-size cast iron figures have appeared in the grounds of an 18th Century house in Norfolk, in the latest major artwork by Sir Antony Gormley. The artist used his own body to mould the sculptures, which have been placed around Houghton Hall before officially opening to the public later this month. They are similar to his famous iron men on Crosby beach in Merseyside. But the new Time Horizon installation, partly a comment on wealth inequality, has not been seen in the UK before. Sir Antony told BBC Breakfast on Friday: ""The idea is to really investigate what we all depend upon. ""So there may be social hierarchies, but I've been thinking about our relationship to the planet, and how can we puncture the visible surface. Rather than decorating the place, I wanted to interrogate it."" He added: ""This is a dispersed work, this isn't one great big object, it's a kind of infection of space as a whole. ""And I hope that what it means is that everybody that comes makes their own work, their own journey, their own connection between place, object and thought."" Time Horizon was originally commissioned in 2006 for an archaeological site in southern Italy , with the sculptures funded by the taxpayers of the Catanzaro province. Each figure weighs 620kg and they have an average height of 191cm. Spread over 300 acres, many simply stand on the ground - but others are buried up to their waist or neck, or are positioned on a plinth. The installation will be open to the public from 21 April until 31 October. Asked by the Sunday Times earlier this month whether the iron sculptures represented everymen questioning the privilege of their surroundings, Sir Antony replied: ""By implication, yes. ""In this ever more divided world,"" he continued, ""between rich and poor, between the 1% and the rest, where does justice come in?"" Born in Hampstead in 1950, Sir Antony's career has seen him become one of the best-known artists in Britain. He is perhaps best known for his Angel of the North sculpture in Gateshead, but his work has been showcased all over the UK. His recent work includes another human figure made from cast iron, titled Doubt, which was displayed in front of Wells Cathedral in Somerset until February 2023. Another Gormley figure can be seen in Yorkshire Sculpture Park , after being moved three times due to the natural deterioration of the tree stump it had been placed on.

James, 21, and Betty, 25, from North Yorkshire, took on the gruelling challenge of travelling from Japan to Indonesia for the BBC show. Contestants must complete the journey with a limited budget and no smart phones or credit cards. Betty joked that after the 9,320 miles (15,000km) trip they were ""just about"" still speaking to each other. Speaking to BBC Radio York, the social media and events manager said she had wanted to show her younger brother there was more out there than just ""lads trips to Magaluf"". ""That was definitely one of the main things I wanted him to get out of it, to see the world,"" she said. ""And, since we've come home, he has talked about going away again travelling with his friends - although probably still drinking, let's be honest."" James added the journey was a lot more mentally and physically challenging than they thought, but ultimately it was worth it to show a different way of travelling. ""For me, one of the main reasons for doing it was prove to people and myself that you don't need a lot of money, you don't need a plan or a lot of contacts to go and see the world, so hopefully I've proved that to those watching the show,"" he said. Since they returned from the competition, they said they have not seen a lot of each other as they had gone back to their day jobs, but they are still on speaking terms after the experience. Betty said: ""I think it wasn't until we were stood on the start line that we thought, 'what have we got ourselves into?' ""You can never quite prepare yourself for spending 24 hours with one other person, eating together, sleeping together and making all the decisions. ""It was tough but we're still here."" Meanwhile, James added that the pair were making the most of their friends and family seeing them on television.

Bedford Who raised more than £17,000 for charities in the town on Saturday , but on Thursday organisers posted online that Bedford Foodbank would not accept future donations from the event. A convention spokesperson said the food bank had put it in ""an impossible position"" but that it wanted supporters to understand why it would no longer support the charity. Bedford Foodbank said the decision was made after the convention donated vouchers instead of money or food, which it claimed ""caused logistical challenges for our food bank"". The charity told the BBC: ""In anticipation of this happening again, we reached out to the event co-ordinators to recommend, for future events, alternative organisations within the area who could better benefit from their generosity. “Bedford Foodbank’s priority is to ensure that we are able to provide emergency support to people who are struggling to get by. The nature of last year’s donation from Bedford Who Charity Con limited our ability to do this.” However, a spokesperson for the Bedford Who event told the BBC it had been previously agreed with the charity that it would donate food vouchers in 2023. ""We do not accept there is any logistical problem with handing out vouchers and the foodbank thanked us for them,"" the spokesperson said. It added that money from the 2024 event was donated in the form of a food donation. The Charity Commission said: “We are aware of concerns relating to a donation decision by Bedford Foodbank and are currently assessing information to determine if there is a role for the commission.” A convention spokesperson said: ""The food bank has put us in an impossible position because we don’t want to damage their reputation. ""On the other hand we also have to release this news because so many people have made such a huge contribution over the years and we owe it to them [to explain] why we are no longer supporting them."" Government guidance states donations can only be rejected when there is a good reason to do so . Donation decisions must be made by trustees of the charity. Bedford Who has run annually since 2015.

209,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72kn4gzq8no,Star Trek's Scotty played by a Scot for first time,"For the first time in almost 60 years Star Trek character Scotty is being played by a Scottish actor. Previously the role has been filled by Canadian actor James Doohan and Englishman Simon Pegg. Now Scottish actor Martin Quinn is portraying a younger version of the character in the prequel series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Martin jokingly told BBC Scotland News, ""We are rebranding him, he's from Paisley now."" Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott has been a character in the science fiction franchise since it first began in 1966. Doohan played the Scottish spaceship engineer in the original series and seven Star Trek films before Pegg took on the role for director JJ Abrams' reboots from 2009. Martin's young Scotty appeared as a surprise cameo at the end of the second season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and he will play a recurring role in season three. The 30-year-old, from the Gallowhill area of Paisley, says he hopes even more Scottish people will watch Star Trek now that they have cast a real Scot. ""It's the power of representation isn't it?"" he said. ""I was always into Star Wars because Ewan McGregor was there. It's because there was a Scottish guy in Star Wars. ""Even though he was doing an English accent, I was like 'that's so cool, he's from here and he's in Hollywood'. ""I wasn't as interested in Star Trek because it wasn't a real Scottish person."" While neither Doohan or Pegg had a natural Scottish accent, both actors and their character were beloved by fans. Martin says: ""I think James Doohan based the character off some Aberdonian he had heard, and even Linlithgow has claimed him, but I'm not sure what that's from."" In 2022, when Martin was auditioning for the series, producers gave the show a code name so he would not know it was Star Trek. ""I suppose that helped because you weren’t putting pressure on yourself to emulate James Doohan,"" he says. Since taking the role, he says he has been working with writers to suggest authentic Scottish changes to his character. ""They let me put in the word 'baw-heid' instead of 'turnip-heid,"" he says. ""Maybe they think all Scottish people are farmers? But they were very gracious about it. ""And [the writers] are wanting to be authentic to Scotland as well, and that's really nice - not everyone's like that."" Martin says his accent has caused occasional confusion with the North American cast and crew on set. ""I'm constantly having to enunciate because I don't think they know what I'm saying,"" he says. ""It’s trying to find the balance, because it’s not just Scottish people watching this TV show, but I want to be as authentic as possible to how I speak."" Martin began his acting career when he was six years old at PACE Youth Theatre in Paisley. The theatre school's alumni also include actorJames McAvoy and singer-songwriter Paolo Nutini. When he was 18, Martin was cast in the lead role in the National Theatre of Scotland production of Let The Right One In. It took him to the Dundee Rep and eventually to London's West End where he was spotted by the actors Richard Wilson and Alan Rickman. They funded the last portion of his scholarship that let him attend Guildhall drama school in London. However, it was Martin's first paid role in BBC comedy Limmy's Show that he says he owes ""everything to"". ""It meant I got praised for doing acting as opposed to a slagging"" by his classmates, he says. He also says there can be a working-class boy stigma that if you prefer acting to football there is something wrong with you. ""We’re potentially missing out on the next generation of really good Scottish actors and that is a bit of a worry,"" he says.",6 days ago,entertainment
210,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68794119,Taylor Swift: Artist's music back on TikTok after dispute,"Taylor Swift's songs are back on TikTok following a dispute that led her label to stop licensing its content to the app. Her music's return on Thursday comes ahead of the release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department. Universal Music pulled songs by its artists in January, including Rihanna and Ariana Grande, citing a licensing dispute. Many artists have complained about inadequate royalties from TikTok. While many of her songs - including You Belong With Me and Cruel Summer - are again available for users to add to their videos, music belonging to Universal's other artists has still not been relisted. That may be because unlike other artists, Swift owns the copyright to her music under the terms of a 2018 deal with Universal. Some reports speculated Swift reached a separate deal with TikTok. ""Swifties"" - Taylor Swift fans - took to the platform to share their delight at her music returning. ""OMG this made my whole year,"" wrote verified user Jessica Golich, adding that users would ""have the whole new album to play with"". Divendra Rai recorded a video lip syncing to Cruel Summer, captioned: ""Welcome back Taylor!!!""

The project has been funded by Kettering Town Council and run jointly with Kettering Civic Society (KCS). The society said permission had been sought before the artists started using the non-descript metal cases as canvasses. Sally Leach has created ""Cafe Corner"" outside a retirement home in Oaktree Court, which reflected the residents' wishes for a garden design. She said: ""We were discussing different ways in which we could improve the local area, and one of the things that came up was the BT boxes. ""We'd seen in other areas people doing projects where they'd put artwork on them, and we thought it would be great to get some of those going through Kettering."" Daisy Farrar-Hayton's ""Pleasure Park"" mural on Macefield Road celebrates Rockingham Pleasure Park, while Mark James's ""Shoemaker"" on Wood Street honours the town's shoemaking history. Ms Farrar-Hayton said: ""It's been great fun injecting a bit of colour on the streets of Kettering. I hope mine and the other fantastic artists' work will make people smile."" Mr James said he had harked back to his younger days. ""My first job was in Tebbutt and Hall in Raunds in a shoemaking factory, and the shoemaking business has always been a constant around this area in my life."" Now the first three cabinets have been completed, the plan is to carry on brightening up the town by painting more of them. Monica Ozdemir, the secretary of KCS, said: ""We appreciate the talented artists who have created their interpretation of a specific memory particular to that part of the town and hope to support more creative street art to flourish across Kettering.""

212,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-68787079,Parkinson's: Retiree to travel more after Africa challenge,"A retiree with Parkinson's has ""plans to travel more"" after driving 18,000 miles (28,968km) across Africa. Guy Deacon CBE has written a new book about his journey from Dorset to Cape Town, with its release coinciding with World Parkinson's Day. The former army colonel, from Sherborne, travelled through 25 countries in his van over three years. A Channel 4 documentary following Mr Deacon's travels is due to be released later this year. He said he had been inspired to undertake the challenge by a book he received while at school that had Land Rovers crossing the desert as the sun set on its cover - leading him to think ""that's what I wanna do when I grow up"". Mr Deacon, who suffers with bradykinesia, a slowness and stiffness of movement, admitted that during the journey, his own health was a concern. He suffered five breakdowns, while taking 3,650 prescription pills to help manage his stage three Parkinson's disease - which he was diagnosed with in 2011. The aim of the trip was to show other people with Parkinson's that ""they need not give up, need not stop doing what they want to do, they need not give up on their dreams and although things are more difficult, they can still do them"", he said. ""They might need help enormously, but they should still try as hard as they can to carry on doing things because it's too easy to give up."" The challenge was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced him to be evacuated from Sierra Leone by the UK government in March 2020. He made it back to West Africa two years after being forced to put his challenge on hold, and with his condition deteriorating significantly. ""That two-year period was enough time for me to recognise the difference, because I went back to do the same sort of thing as I was doing before and discovered it was much more difficult,"" he said. On future plans, Mr Deacon said he had ""two choices"" - either ""do nothing and gradually subside into nothingness"" or ""try and get out and about, and do what you want to do"". He added: ""I still have plans to travel more...because I love doing it, and as long as I have the time and the help, and I don't rush, and I don't get too stressed, that's all possible - and why shouldn't I try and do it?""

The political campaigner ""wrote the entire memoir himself,"" publishers Vintage told the BBC. Navalny began work on his book while recovering from his 2020 poisoning with a nerve agent. He died in February after three years in jail for charges widely seen as politically motivated. His memoir will be ""the full story of his life: his youth, his call to activism, his marriage and family, and his commitment to the cause of Russian democracy and freedom in the face of a world superpower determined to silence him,"" Vintage said. The publisher added that it ""expresses Navalny's total conviction that change cannot be resisted and will come"". The book - due out in around six months - is slated to include ""never-before-seen correspondence from prison"", according to Vintage. The campaigner and lawyer recounts ""his political career, the many attempts on his life, and the lives of the people closest to him, and the relentless campaign he and his team waged against an increasingly dictatorial regime"" in the work. Navalny's widow, Yulia, said: ""This book is a testament not only to Alexei's life, but to his unwavering commitment to the fight against dictatorship - a fight he gave everything for, including his life. ""Through its pages, readers will come to know the man I loved deeply - a man of profound integrity and unyielding courage."" She said that sharing his story would honour his memory and ""inspire others to stand up for what is right and to never lose sight of the values that truly matter"". Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) exposed corruption at almost every level of the Russian state - frequently targeting President Vladimir Putin and his entourage. Navalny was immediately imprisoned after returning to Russia in 2021. He was moved to one of Russia's toughest penal colonies shortly before his death. According to the prison service, he had gone for a walk when he lost consciousness and died. One of his closest allies, FBK chief Ivan Zhdanov, said it was ""highly likely"" Navalny had been murdered. Vintage described the book as ""Navalny's final letter to the world"". The publisher called it an account of his last years spent in ""the most brutal prison on Earth; a reminder of why the principles of individual freedom matter so deeply; and a rousing call to continue the work for which he sacrificed his life"". Navalny, 47, was last seen in public the day before his death, looking well and laughing during a court hearing via video link. The book will be published on 22 October.",7 days ago,entertainment

215,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68790064,Fallout TV show stars say show goes big on details,"Another TV show based on a video game has landed... and critics say it's great. Is the world ending? It certainly is in Fallout - the adaptation of the post-apocalyptic role-playing game currently earning rave reviews. The series weaves together the stories of three characters striving to survive in a world ravaged by nuclear bombs. And BBC Newsbeat spoke to two of the actors behind them - Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten - to find out more. The Fallout games are set 200 years after a nuclear war leaves the Earth a wasteland, as players navigate the new world and the different factions that live within it. Ella plays Lucy MacLean, a vault dweller raised underground in a protective bunker. ""She comes from a long line of people that were taught and that believe it is their duty to procreate and create the next generation of Americans who will one day go up to the surface and rebuild America after the nuclear war that happened,"" says Ella. ""She's very innocent and sheltered and naïve. But I will say there is more to her than meets the eye."" Aaron, meanwhile, plays Maximus, a member of the Brotherhood of Steel - one of the Fallout world's tribal communities that live outside in the wastelands. Aaron says the group ""worships old world tech"" - relics of the 1950s when the bombs destroyed the world. ""Whatever they can find in the wasteland, they sort of collect for themselves,"" he says. ""And they feel like that makes them powerful. And that's kind of what they project outwardly. ""The success of survival, that they are a powerful, group of guys who also wield things called power armour."" Power armour - mech-style battle suits - are one of the series' signature features, and often appear on the covers of the games. Fans went crazy for preview shots featuring the elaborate costumes released late last year, and Aaron says the attention to detail was a key feature of the £150m production. He tells Newsbeat the show's director Jonathan Nolan - brother of Oppenheimer director Christopher - used lots of practical effects rather than computer-generated imagery to create Fallout's world. And he believes viewers will feel the benefit when they watch the Amazon Prime show. ""That feeds the creative process for everyone involved, to work with something that we can actually see and use and walk around in. ""You know, it's not a tennis ball. ""Or a bloke in a green leotard,"" says Ella, referring to another common technique used to create CGI sequences. Critics have praised the Amazon Prime show's sense of fun, with the Guardian calling it an ""absolute blast"" in its five-star review . Some, like the Telegraph , said its comedic ultra-violence might put some viewers off, but praised its ""over-the-top action"". And video game website IGN said the show was an ""all-time great"" that rivals last year's much-praised Last of US TV show. It's a much warmer reception than Amazon's mega-budget The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power received. And the streamer will likely be hoping that viewers will stick with Fallout to the end, which reports suggested was not the case with its JRR Tolkien-inspired epic. But one thing you might not want to do, is live with Ella in a real apocalypse. ""I would ban the vault suits,"" she says, referring to the blue jumpsuit her character wears. ""I think we should be a bit more experimental and maybe like, make our own clothes, do fancy dress. ""Something like fancy dress Fridays, make it fun."" Ella admits that some people might find that annoying. ""It'd be too much. Too much,"" she says. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",7 days ago,entertainment
216,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68789512,Asante Gold: UK returns looted Ghana artefacts after 150 years,"The UK has returned dozens of artefacts looted from what is today Ghana - more than 150 years after they were taken. Some 32 gold and silver items have been sent on long-term loan to the country by the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and the British Museum. They were stolen from the court of the Asante king, known as the Asantehene, during 19th century conflicts between the British and powerful Asante people. The objects are expected to be returned to the current king on Friday. His chief negotiator, Ivor Agyeman-Duah, told the BBC that the objects are currently in ""safe hands"" in Ghana ahead of them being formally received. They are due to go on display next month at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti region, as part of celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of the current Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II. In January, the BBC reported long-term loan deals to return the items had been agreed . Among the returned artefacts are a gold peace pipe, a sword of state and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king. The gold artefacts are the ultimate symbol of the Asante royal government and are believed to be invested with the spirits of former Asante kings. Nana Oforiatta Ayim, special adviser to Ghana's culture minister, previously told the BBC that the objects were ""part of the soul of the nation"" and that it was ""pieces of ourselves returning"". The loan, which was negotiated with the king and not with the Ghanaian government, will last for three years with the option to extend for a further three years. The Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) is lending 17 pieces and 15 are from the British Museum. Both museums have said they are delighted to have been able to have returned the objects on loan as part of an important cultural collaboration. Some national museums in the UK - including the V&A and the British Museum - are banned by law from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin. The return of the Asante items comes a month ahead of celebrations marking the silver jubilee of the Asantehene. The Asante people built what was once one of the most powerful and formidable states in west Africa - trading in, among others, gold, textiles and enslaved people. The kingdom was famed for its military might and wealth. Even now, when the Asantehene shakes hands on official occasions, he can be so weighed down with heavy gold bracelets that he sometimes has an aide whose job is to support his arm. Europeans were attracted to what they later named the Gold Coast by the stories of African wealth and Britain fought repeated battles with the Asante in the 19th Century. In 1874 after an Asante attack, British troops launched a ""punitive expedition"", in the colonial language of the time, ransacking Kumasi and taking many of the palace treasures. Most of the items the V&A returned were bought at an auction on 18 April 1874 at Garrards, the London jewellers who maintain the UK's Crown Jewels, while some of those the British Museum is loaning were looted during a later conflict in 1895-96. The return of the artefacts comes during a continuing debate over what to do with other items exported from their native lands - including the Benin Bronzes and Elgin Marbles, also known as the Parthenon Sculptures. Some countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership. However, these types of agreements are seen by others as a way for Britain to confront the cultural legacy of its colonial past while also building better relationships for the future.",7 days ago,entertainment

Mark Sykes from Cheshire was lead singer of Computerman, a band who met at university in 2002 and were soon signed to a record label. They split up in 2007, shortly after recording Death of the Great Romantic. Another former band member managed to secure the release of the indie pop album on a number of streaming services. ""It's just a dream come true that it's finally out there,"" said the 42-year-old from Willaston, near Nantwich. Mr Sykes said the band moved to Nottingham after university in Leicester to make a go of the music business. They built up a following, signed to a label, released a single in 2005, and went on tour while holding down part-time jobs. But it all ended in 2007 due to creative differences, shortly after the album was ready to go. ""My children weren't alive when I first made that music with my band,"" he said. When the band's songs were released online in March, the former members stayed up to see them go live at midnight. The Year 6 teacher, who now also runs a children's after-school rock band, said the music was his life's work, and he was very proud to still have a ""tiny, tiny bit of rock 'n' roll history"".

The Monopoly film has been in development for more than a decade, according to the Hollywood Reporter. But it was announced on Wednesday that Robbie's production company LuckyChap will produce it. Hasbro Entertainment, part of the American toy company, will also be a producer. Robbie's company most recently worked on Saltburn and last year's hit Barbie, which the Australian actress also starred in. Speaking to Variety in February, Robbie, 33, said: ""We want to make more films that have the effect that Barbie has. ""I don't know if it has to be Barbie 2. Why can't it be another big, original, bold idea where we get an amazing filmmaker, a big budget to play with, and the trust of a huge conglomerate behind them to go and really play? I want to do that."" Adam Fogelson, chairman of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said they were ""tremendously excited"" about the project and believe it could be the next blockbuster. Zev Foreman, head of film for Hasbro Entertainment, said: ""As one of the most iconic games in the world, Monopoly provides an incredible platform for storytelling opportunities."" Last December Lionsgate extended its development rights to the board game when it bought Hasbro's Entertainment One (eOne). Barbie was the highest-grossing film last year, making $1.38bn (£1.1bn) globally. Bestselling board game Monopoly has taught generations of children to buy up property, stack it with hotels and charge fellow players sky-high rents for the privilege of accidentally landing there. It was patented in 1904 by a left-wing American feminist called Lizzy Magie. She called it the Landlord's Game and it evolved into what we now know as Monopoly. However it hit the mainstream 30 years later when Monopoly was first marketed in the United States during the Great Depression.

220,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240410-fallout-review-this-adaptation-of-the-post-apocalyptic-video-game-franchise-is-a-vivid-brutal-romp,"Fallout review: This adaptation of the post-apocalyptic video game franchise is 'a vivid, brutal romp'","Since the 90s, the Fallout games have been a phenomenon – and now this visually terrific, blackly humorous TV spin-off should prove equally as popular, with fans and newbies alike. In the 23rd Century, perky young Lucy MacLean (Yellowjackets star Ella Purnell) is quite the catch. ""My reproductive organs are intact, my hygiene well-maintained,"" she proudly tells the councillors hearing her marriage application, and she's thrilled when the panel approves her request to wed someone she's never even seen, let alone met. However, when the arrangement doesn't work out quite as planned, Lucy finds herself leaving her home to undertake a perilous quest that will bring her into contact with would-be soldier Maximus (Aaron Moten) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a dangerous bounty-hunter. All three are in pursuit of a mysterious object with the power to change a world devastated by nuclear war. Fallout is inspired by the hugely popular video game franchise of the same name. The TV series tells an original story but is set in the same milieu as the source material and retains many of its elements, including its retrofuturistic aesthetic – much of the technology looks as though it might have been imagined by a 1950s sci-fi writer. Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, the husband-and-wife team behind another science-fiction TV blockbuster, Westworld, are among the makers of Fallout. Todd Howard, a senior executive at Bethesda Game Studios, the company behind the game, is on the producing team, and has said that what happens in the series can be viewed as Fallout canon. It is mostly set in 2296, 219 years after a nuclear apocalypse – chillingly depicted in the first episode's opening sequence – left the planet an irradiated desert. Lucy is a ""vault dweller"", one of the privileged few who live in orderly societies housed in vast underground bunkers built before the ""Great War"" by a powerful company called Vault-Tec. Her mission takes her outside of her vault for the first time and on to the surface, known as the Wasteland, where society has descended into lawless chaos, a kind of futuristic Wild West in which regular people – or as regular as it's possible to be in this depraved new world – coexist with giant bugs, mutated, rotting humans called Ghouls, terrifying people-eating creatures and a militaristic, heavily armed organisation called the Brotherhood of Steel, to which Maximus belongs.  Across the show's eight episodes, we follow Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul as their paths cross and uncross. We also learn something of the events before the war, and about how the vaults came into being and acquired their distinctive iconography – which includes Vault Boy, the cheery, thumbs-up cartoon motif who is Vault-Tec's mascot (fun fact: the mother and stepfather of British actor Purnell run a gym in London called The Vault). The meandering plot doesn't really bear close scrutiny but plot's not the most important thing here. There are a number of factors that make Fallout stand out. Firstly, it looks terrific. Clearly little expense has been spared on sets and design and special effects. The dusty Wasteland is expansive and nightmarish. The vaults look both properly lived-in and as if they could withstand nuclear attack. The power armour suits used by the Brotherhood of Steel are convincingly solid. Goggins is virtually unrecognisable as the noseless, decaying Ghoul. Appalling injuries and wounds are revoltingly realistic. (There's a lot of violence). More like this: Another plus is its wholehearted embrace of the game's dark, surreal humour, much of which arises from the bizarre situations that the characters find themselves in. There are demented, homicidal robots, perverted peripatetic pharmacists, amiable cycloptic vault overseers. The soundtrack ironically juxtaposes soulful, croony period music from the likes of the Ink Spots and Nat King Cole with the horrors of post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. The show also satirises capitalism and Big Tech (another irony, given that it's on Amazon's Prime Video). Purnell is excellent as Lucy, a trusting, optimistic kind of gal, described by the makers of the show as part Leslie Knope from Parks and Recreation, part The Simpsons' Ned Flanders. At the beginning of the series, she's a wide-eyed naif who believes everything she is told about the world. Her experiences in the Wasteland, a school of very hard knocks indeed, open her eyes to a few unsavoury truths as the rads (units of radiation) tick up on her Pip-Boy (wearable computer). Goggins as The Ghoul has the swagger of a spaghetti western anti-hero and manages to convey subtle emotion despite looking like something that's spent years buried alive – which he has. Moten keeps us guessing as to whether Maximus is a good guy or not The large cast also includes Kyle MacLachlan, Zach Cherry and Michael Emerson and there are several entertaining cameos, those of Dale Dickey and Matt Berry being especially enjoyable. Viewers who love the games will relish the chance to discover new aspects of the Fallout universe. Those who've never played them will enjoy a vivid, brutal romp with flashes of absurdist comedy and set in an engrossing, richly detailed world. The finale makes plain the showrunners' desire to continue. Executive producers Joy and Nolan's last big sci-fi show, The Peripheral, was canned after one season, reportedly as a result of industry strikes. Westworld was cancelled four seasons into a planned six-season run. I think it'll be third time lucky. Fallout is both totally rad and an absolute blast. ★★★★☆ Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on 10 April at 18:00 PT and 21:00 ET in the US, and 11 April at 02.00 BST in the UK. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

221,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68778047,Joker 2: Lady Gaga appears in trailer for sequel (which isn't a musical),"Lady Gaga is seen bringing the music, dance and a very bad romance to the Joker film sequel in its first trailer. The singer and actress plays a new version of Harley Quinn in Joker: Folie à Deux opposite Joaquin Phoenix, who won an Oscar for the original movie. The pair seemingly meet and fall in love in Arkham Asylum before apparently escaping and forming a musical duo. Director Todd Phillips said it isn't a musical, as had been rumoured, but that music is ""an essential element"". Phoenix won an Oscar for best actor for his performance in 2019's Joker. Here are seven things of note from the sequel's trailer. Arthur Fleck (aka Joker) and Harley Quinn's eyes appear to meet as she takes part in a singing group in Arkham Asylum, where he was left at the end of the 2019 film. Her origin story is as a psychiatrist at the institution who is obsessed with the failed comedian and ""crown prince of crime"" - but here, she could be a fellow inmate. It's not quite clear which side of the bars she's on. ""It seems to confirm a massive shift in Harley Quinn's origin story,"" wrote IGN's Alex Stedman , ""as it appears to show her as a patient in Arkham Asylum rather than as a psychiatrist"". ""Long gone, it seems, are the days of Dr Harleen Quinzel."" But if she is working rather than residing there, that might help explain how she can help him escape. ""Let's get outta here,"" she whispers, before the pair are seen in a fantasy rooftop dance sequence. That abruptly cuts to a gritty Gotham City street, where they continue their carefree dance as emergency vehicles rush in the direction of whatever chaos they have just caused. ""We use music to make us whole - to balance the fractures within ourselves,"" the title character is heard saying in voiceover. Joker has found a partner in love and crime, but also music. In one clip, they perform as Joker & Harley on a TV show, complete with full band and backing singers. The trailer is soundtracked by What the World Needs Now Is Love, made famous in 1965 by Jackie DeShannon. ""I like to say it's a movie where music is an essential element,"" Phillips told CinemaCon on Tuesday, when asked whether this is a musical. ""To me that doesn't veer too far from the first film,"" he said, adding that in that original film, ""Arthur has music in him. He has a grace to him."" Indeed, one of the most famous scenes from the first film was where Joker danced down a flight of stone steps. In the new trailer, Harley is seen walking up those same steps. In another snippet, she and Joker mimic his original dance as they go down what look like courthouse steps, with cheering crowds on either side. Thankfully, there's no Gary Glitter music this time. At another point, Harley, wearing a white wedding dress and veil, dances down an aisle to a chapel, where Joker is waiting in a white suit, apparently accompanied by backing singers as bridesmaids. This is, however, one of several fantasy sequences that are reminiscent of classic Hollywood movie musicals. That led one person on X to say it looks like 2016 musical La La Land, but for ""people who hear voices"". The British comedian and actor pops up in the trailer as some sort of authority figure who asks Arthur/Joker: ""What's changed?"" ""I'll tell you what's changed - I'm not alone any more,"" he replies. Coogan's appearance led some to hope for a repeat of a line by his most famous character, Alan Partridge, when he declared: ""I'm Batman!"" Which really would be a plot twist. After causing mass mayhem, with riots on the streets, an explosion in a packed room with TV cameras (the same studio as their performance?), and Joker and Harley running hand-in-hand out of a flaming building, the trailer ends quietly with Harley apparently visiting Arthur in prison. Using her red lipstick, she draws a curved line on the glass between them and tells him: ""I want to see the real you."" Phoenix's glum face slowly shifts and breaks into a big smile, which aligns with the now out-of-focus lipstick to suddenly become Joker's famous red face paint. A masterful shot which we hope took several hundred attempts to perfect, rather than having the lipstick digitally added in post-production. The trailer actually ends with the release date - 10.04.24 - which means it's out TODAY! Hurrah! Oh, wait. Americans write their days and months the wrong way around. So we'll actually have until 4 October.",8 days ago,entertainment

The world of hip-hop has no shortage of feuds. Some last decades – 50 Cent and Ja Rule have been trading insults for 25 years now – while others, like the recent spat involving J Cole and Kendrick Lamar, are over in a comparative flash. Within the space of just a few days, rapper J Cole released a track that took swipes at Kendrick Lamar and then, during a live performance at the Dreamville festival in North Carolina over the weekend, he gave a four-minute speech apologising for what he'd done . Warning: This article contains language that some may find offensive. The feud between Cole and Lamar , which also involves Drake, was first triggered late last year. The three stars have traded jibes sporadically over the years – including Lamar calling out Drake as ""a sensitive rapper"" and a ""fake"" at the 2013 BET awards – but the bad blood never seemed too serious. Then, in October, Drake and Cole released the track First Person Shooter on which they declared themselves – along with Lamar – hip-hop's ""big three"". Hardly an insult – but Lamar took offence to being lumped into this group. In March he made a guest appearance on the track Like That by Future and Metro Boomin to point out that, there's no big three, ""it's just big me"". Last week, in response to this slight, Cole released the diss track 7 Minute Drill, aimed directly at Lamar, including lines like: ""He still doin' shows, but fell off like The Simpsons/Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic."" Many fans and critics felt the song fell flat. In a review of the track, Rolling Stone said : ""Cole may have thought he was doing the sensible thing by being measured on 7 Minute Drill, but rap beef is a toxic, nonsensical arena."" It seems Cole himself ultimately agreed, calling it a ""mis-step"", promising to update it or remove it from streaming services. The rapper said he'd felt pressured into it because ""the world wanted to see blood"" and, indeed, some fans on social media seemed disappointed that the ""beef"" was over so soon. But many others applauded Cole for what they saw as an act of maturity. Charlamagne Tha God said he had ""nothing but respect"" for Cole, and saluted him for ""breaking the cycle"". This latest feud comes just a couple of months after Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj traded insults on record. The former's track Hiss, referenced Megan's Law, a piece of legislation that requires public disclosure of information about sex offenders. Minaj took this as a reference to her husband Kenneth Petty, who is a registered sex offender following a 1995 attempted rape conviction. She responded with the song Bigfoot, apparently mocking the incident in which Megan was shot in the foot. The track was widely criticised, with Shamira Ibrahim writing in the Guardian that it was ""a rare stumble for Minaj"" and a ""reductive tactic"". With Cole regretting – and retracting – his track, and Minaj receiving condemnation for hers, could this be the end of the diss track, as we know it? Diss tracks – songs that intentionally disrespect others, often fellow musicians – have long been associated with the hip-hop genre. A natural progression from battle rap , where musicians trade insults on stage, diss tracks came to prominence in the 1980s, most famously with The Roxanne Wars , an exchange of 50 diss tracks by more than 30 artists. Over the years, hip-hop feuds have inspired some of the genre's most memorable tracks, including Jay-Z's Takeover (on which he calls Nas ""just garbage"") and 2Pac's Hit 'Em Up, a furious tirade in response to The Notorious B.I.G's 1995 track, Who Shot Ya? But while the term itself may have come from hip-hop, the concept of throwing shade at someone via song goes back decades. In the 1950s, R&B star Joe Tex called out his musical and love rival James Brown by name in the song You Keep Her. John Lennon targeted former bandmate Paul McCartney in 1971's How Do You Sleep?. In 1974 Lynyrd Skynyrd took aim at Neil Young in Sweet Home Alabama. More like this: • The song that's the key to Cowboy Carter • Is Michael Jackson's image being cleaned up? • The surprising history of a classic breakup song Familiar themes of diss tracks are questioning someone's credibility or talent, ""clapping back"" at personal slights (such as Gwen Stefani on Hollaback Girl) or calling out an ex-lover or friend ( Miley Cyrus's Flowers ). They can be funny or savage. They can also – to the delight of the public and dismay of the subject – reveal intensely personal information. A back and forth between Drake and Pusha T resulted with the latter revealing that Drake had a son in The Story of Adidon. Sometimes artists are explicit about who they're calling out – like Eminem on one of his many tracks about Mariah Carey (she responded with one of her own: Obsessed). Other times they're more cryptic, leaving the listener to try and identify the subject of their ire, which can add to the appeal. Carly Simon's 1972 track You're So Vain was variously thought to be about David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Cat Stevens and James Taylor until, in 2015 she revealed that – some of the song at least – is about Warren Beatty. Taylor Swift – a modern-day master of the diss track – rarely identifies her subjects, but leaves enough clues for fans to piece the puzzle together. Fans and the media have speculated that she has taken aim at John Mayer (Dear John), Kanye (This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things), Jake Gyllenhaal (We Are Never Getting Back Together), Scooter Braun (Vigilante Shit) and, most famously, Katy Perry, in the song Bad Blood. When Swift gave an interview to Rolling Stone saying the song was about a fellow pop star, many people assumed it was Kary Perry. Perry herself then tweeted ""watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing"" and later released Swish Swish, her response). But that supposed feud is now long over – Katy Perry was even seen singing along to Bad Blood on Swift's Eras tour earlier this year. ""Got to see an old friend shine tonight,"" Perry posted later on Instagram. In fact, in an industry in which things are already hard enough for women, fewer stars seem willing to play the game of tearing their peers down anymore. ""It's very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other"" Swift told Time magazine last year. Likewise, in hip-hop, some are questioning the value of stoking up rivalries that – at their most extreme – have had tragic consequences. As Charlamagne Tha God also said when praising Cole: ""Y'all want a man to attack a man for your entertainment because we are a culture that feeds off conflict."" Yet diss tracks still have the ability to get people talking and create a social media storm, as well as bolster chart success : Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar's Like That topped the Billboard Hot 100 after the furore stirred up by Lamar's lyrics. Plus they are the ultimate product of a musician's prerogative to get things off their chest via their art – for those reasons, it's hard to imagine they'll ever go away. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

223,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68777801,Eurovision organisers condemn online abuse of contestants,"Organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have said that abuse and harassment of artists over Israel's participation in the competition is ""unacceptable and totally unfair"". This year's competition will take place in Sweden in May, amid calls for Israel to be banned over the war in Gaza. Several contestants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, have rejected calls for them to boycott the show. And it has been reported that Israel's Eden Golan has faced death threats. The 20-year-old has received several messages directly to her Instagram account, reported celebrity website Walla Celebs. The Jerusalem Post said the singer would arrive in Malmo, Sweden, with ""three times"" the usual number of security guards. In a statement, the European Broadcasting Union, which organises Eurovision, acknowledged ""the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision song contest - set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East - has provoked"". ""While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest,"" the statement continued. Jean Philip De Tender, deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union, added that the decision to allow Israel's participation was ""the sole responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies and not that of the individual artists"". ""We urge everyone to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue and support the artists who are working tirelessly - on what is a music and entertainment show - to share their music with the world,"" he added. Israel's public broadcaster, Kan, is a member of the EBU, giving it the right to participate in the contest. Organisers have resisted calls for it to be suspended, saying the show ""is not a contest between governments"". However, the EBU did force Israel to change the lyrics of Golan's song October Rain, after deciding the original was too political. The first version was widely considered to be a reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, with several lyrics paying tribute to the victims. Kan initially refused to change the song, saying it would prefer to withdraw from the contest - but Israel's President, Isaac Herzog, later called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure the country could participate. Now renamed Hurricane, the dramatic piano ballad is ninth favourite with bookmakers to win the competition. However, Israel's participation is unlikely to go unremarked when the contest takes place next month. Swedish police are preparing for multiple protests in Malmo in the week of the competition, and nine competitors have called for ""an immediate and lasting ceasefire"" in Gaza. The statement, signed by Olly Alexander, Ireland's Bambi Thug and Danish entrant Saba, among others, came in response to calls for musicians to boycott the show. ""We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections,"" the artists wrote. One person who has pulled out of the competition, however, is Iceland's long-running commentator, Gísli Marteinn. The TV personality and former politician, who has helmed 15 editions of the song contest, announced his decision on Instagram, citing the organisers' ""lack of reaction"" to the situation in Gaza. ""For me, Eurovision is about atmosphere and joy, and I feel neither in this year's competition,"" he wrote. Sweden won last year's Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool, with pop star Loreen taking home her second trophy for the stormy electro-ballad Tattoo.",8 days ago,entertainment

The promenade at Cleveleys in Lancashire became part of a galaxy far, far away when it served as a location for scenes in the Disney+ series Andor. Artist Christian Fenn, who is also known as Seca One, was commissioned to create the mural as part of a wider project. He said it had been ""such a fantastic project to work on"". Andor, a prequel to the 2016 Star Wars film Rogue One, followed the character Cassian Andor five years before the events of that movie. Filming in the coastal town in 2021 transported the area around Cafe Cove on the seafront to the distant tropical world of Niamos in episode seven of the series. The mural was funded by the government's UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF). It took about 80 hours to complete and also includes depictions of artworks from the council's Mythic Coast sculpture trail, such as the Sea Ogre which stands on the town's beach. Fenn said he was delighted to have contributed to the town's artworks. ""I am lucky enough to be able to paint all over the world and I am proud to say that the crowd on my doorstep in Cleveleys is up there with the best of them,"" he said. Sara Ordonez, the UKSPF programme manager at Wyre Council, said the artist had ""brought the project brief to life with such vitality and with expert execution"". ""The mural is just fantastic,"" she said. ""It will really help to improve the visitor experience for people who come to Cleveleys."" Why not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

St Albans school mates Alfie Watts, 20, and Owen Wood, 21, were one of five duos who had to race across Asia between Japan and Lombok without their phones or access to bank accounts. Mr Watts said: ""We came out of the show thinking we were argument free. I don't think we had any arguments but to be honest we might not recollect exactly what happened."" Mr Wood added: ""When we finished our race you get the time to reflect - so much happened, but at the end of the day the person you did it with is arguably the biggest part of it."" The BAFTA-award winning series returns to BBC One on Wednesday. Duos will cross six seas and eight borders as they make their way to the finish line on the Indonesian island of Lombok, where the first to arrive claims a cash prize of £20,000. The two best friends admitted it was a challenge not having access to technology. Mr Watts, who is a referee for Hertfordshire Football Association, said: ""It's really difficult because you don't have Google translate... You really do have to use your ingenuity."" The duo said they were still able to communicate with locals to find the best places to eat as people in the continent were much friendlier than they are at home. Student pilot Mr Wood, who turned 21 during filming, agreed: ""Local knowledge is better than Google half of the time - more than half the time actually, 90% of the time.""

226,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0denrgwx09o,Plaque removed from Eazy-E memorial bench,"A bench in East Sussex that honours the life of rapper Eazy-E appears to have been vandalised. Guy Stevens, from Newhaven, first joked in 2019 that he wanted a memorial bench for the American rapper in the town, despite the two having no connection. Eazy-E, real name Eric Wright - who died in 1995 - was the founding member of Californian rap group NWA and is often referred to as the ""Godfather of Gangsta Rap"". Mr Stevens was delighted to raise enough money to fund the bench in 2019, but its memorial plaque appears to have been ripped off. The bench was a popular tourist destination on Denton Island in the harbour town. “It’s been a good luck charm for the town. I’ve had messages from people on Facebook saying they came down from Scotland [to see it],” Mr Stevens told the BBC. Referring to those who allegedly vandalised it, he said there were ""some very pathetic people in the world"". ""My fundraising days are done so there won’t be a replacement, but I’ll be speaking to the council,” he added. Mr Stevens joked that as Eazy-E was from America's West Coast, it could have been a rival from the East Coast that removed the plaque. However, this would mean the culprit travelled 5,484 miles (8,825 km) each way to vandalise the bench. Mr Stevens raised £1,600 ($2,024) to fund the £1,177 ($1,489) bench in 2019. He donated the rest to HIV charities in Brighton. Sussex Police said they were not aware of the vandalism incident. Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

Artist Ibrahim Mahama's work, Purple Hibiscus, spans about 2,000 sq m and is hand-embroidered with more than 130 batakaris. The robes were worn by Ghanaian kings and are often saved by families over generations. Mahama collaborated with craftspeople from Tamale where the colossal panels were woven and sewn by hand. Named after Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 2003 novel, the components of Purple Hibiscus were collected through a process of exchange and barter from communities across Northern Ghana. The pieces are so large that, on days when matches were not taking place, the artist rented out the Tamale football stadium so the work could be spread out on the floor as it was sewn by hundreds of women from local sewing collectives. The huge artwork weighs a total of 20 tonnes and was hung on the central London building using a system of straps, ratchets and weights. Its fabric panels are fitted closely to the building in order to avoid issues around noise and wind. The artist said the work signified his ""interest in the lifecycles of textiles and what can be learnt from the historical memories embedded within them"". He added: ""Worn, degraded and bearing traces of years of use, these smocks are testaments to the endurance of traditional belief systems, and the continued relevance of intergenerational knowledge."" Batakaris were worn by ordinary men as well as kings, and in the 19th Century, Ashanti military forces used them as a war dress. Made from cotton and covered with leather pouches and metal cases that contained talismans, as it was believed by the Ashanti forces that this variant of the batakari was bulletproof. Mahama's piece is part of a bigger project at the Barbican called Unravel: The Power and politics of Textiles in Art . The group exhibition contains works from 50 international artists using textiles, fibre and thread to ""reimagine the world"". The free installation can be seen on the lakeside terrace of the brutalist building from Wednesday until 18 August.

Sarah Lethieullier’s dolls' house, with over 700 fixtures and fittings, is described as being one of the best surviving examples of its kind in the world. It was left unscathed in a blaze which badly damaged many items at Uppark House, in West Sussex, in 1989. The finely decorated scale model, which dates from the 1730s, can now be seen at the Huguenot Museum, in Rochester, after being offered on loan for the first time. The official opening of the unusual exhibit takes place on Wednesday. On display within its nine rooms are lead glass, bed warmers, miniature 17th Century landscape paintings, and 300-year-old beds. The dolls' house was originally made for the Lethieullier family and came to Uppark after Sarah Lethieullier, who came from a prominent French Protestant Huguenot family, married Sir Matthew Fetherstonhaugh in 1746. Tessa Murdoch, from the Huguenot Museum Trust, said: “A Georgian future lady needed to learn household management. ""The nine-room Palladian dolls’ house taught Sarah everything she needed to know, from taking care of the objects within the house, to learning the rightful place of her footmen, parlour maid and staff.” The dolls’ house was admired by visiting guests to Uppark, including novelist HG Wells. Dr Murdoch said: ""He was inspired by the microcosm of the dolls’ house to recreate miniature worlds in his writing, in particular, his most famous novel, The Time Machine.” Rebecca Wallis, senior curator at the National Trust, said: ""This is a fantastic opportunity to share the story of Sarah Lethieullier and the dolls’ house with more people and will enable new research into the Huguenot history of Uppark.""

229,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-68770187,Mona: Court rules women’s-only exhibit must allow male visitors,"An Australian museum has been ordered to allow men into a women's-only exhibit, following a high-stakes court case over the matter. The Ladies Lounge at Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) sought to highlight historic misogyny by banning male visitors. After being denied entry, one filed a gender discrimination lawsuit, which he won on Tuesday. ""We are deeply disappointed by this decision,"" a Mona representative said. The velvet-clad lounge - which contains some of the museum's most-acclaimed works, from Picasso to Sidney Nolan - has been open since 2020. It was designed to take the concept of an old Australian pub - a space which largely excluded women until 1965 - and turn it on its head, offering champagne and five-star service to female attendees, while refusing men at the door. Jason Lau, a New South Wales resident who visited Mona in April of last year, was one such male. Representing himself throughout the case, he argued that the museum had violated the state's anti-discrimination act by failing to provide ""a fair provision of goods and services in line with the law"" to him and other ticket holders who didn't identify as female. The museum had responded by claiming the rejection Mr Lau had felt was part of the artwork, and that the law in Tasmania allowed for discrimination if it was ""designed to promote equal opportunity"" for a group of people who had been historically disadvantaged. In his ruling, Richard Grueber dismissed the argument - finding that it was ""not apparent"" how preventing men from experiencing the famous artworks held within the Ladies Lounge achieved that goal. Throughout the case, the museum's supporters, including artist Kirsha Kaechele - who created the work - had used the courtroom as a space for performance art, wearing matching navy suits and engaging in synchronised movements. Mr Grueber said that while the behaviour of the women hadn't disrupted the hearing, it was ""inappropriate, discourteous and disrespectful, and at worst contumelious and contemptuous"". His decision to allow ""persons who do not identify as ladies"" to access the exhibit will come into effect in 28 days. In a statement, Ms Kaechele said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the ruling, and would be taking time to ""absorb the situation, seek council and compose myself"". She added that she was grateful for public support through what has been ""one of the most difficult periods of my life"". Ms Kaechele previously told the BBC the case had felt like her artwork was coming to life and signalled she would fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. But she also noted that having the Ladies Lounge shut down could help drive home its intended message. ""If you were just looking at it from an aesthetic standpoint, being forced to close would be pretty powerful."" A spokesperson for Mona said the museum would consider its options, but in court it had previously said the artwork would be untenable if the ruling was not in their favour.",10 April 2024,entertainment
230,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68776530,Bridget Jones 4: Renee Zellweger joined by Leo Woodall for Mad About The Boy,"As Bridget Jones herself said ""everyone knows diaries are just full of crap"", but the ones dictating her inner monologues also make wonderful films. So wonderful, in fact, that a fourth is about to begin production. Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson are set to reprise their roles in the new film Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. It is set for US release on Valentine's Day 2025, but no date has been announced for the UK. The film takes its title from the latest Bridget Jones novel, which was published in 2013. Readers rejoin Bridget in her 50s, a mother to two children and widowed following the death of Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth in the earlier films). The production studio has not commented on how closely the new film will follow the storyline of its paperback namesake, but it has been revealed author Helen Fielding has written the script. It has also been confirmed that two-time Oscar winner Zellweger will reprise her role as the beloved, hapless Bridget Jones, and Grant, who did not appear in the third film, will return as dashing rapscallion Daniel Cleaver. Thompson, who debuted her character of Bridget's despairing obstetrician in Bridget Jones's Baby, is also set for a return. New faces on the cast list include Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave) and Leo Woodall (One Day), who is rumoured to play Bridget's younger love interest as she faces dating anew. British author Helen Fielding previously said she had decided to write Mark Darcy out of the series because she didn't want Bridget to become ""a smug married"", a fate deemed utterly lamentable by earlier musings of Jones. When Mad about the Boy was published, Fielding told BBC News she had written it in secret to be free of expectations and pressure and ""so that I could write it like the first one"".",10 April 2024,entertainment
231,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68770631,Big Zuu: TV chef cuts down on cooking and rap for Ramadan,"For a TV chef and rapper, a month of not being able to eat or listen to music sounds almost impossible. But Big Zuu has set out to achieve exactly that this Ramadan. Since early March, Muslims across the world have been fasting and praying to remember the significance of the Quran. For the Islamic community, the holiest time of the year is a way to connect more deeply with their faith. And Zuu says that's been the case for him. With his two jobs greatly affecting the lifestyle he leads, the 28-year-old says he's ""made mistakes"" in the past. ""I was estranged from my religion at times,"" Zuu tells BBC Newsbeat. Over the past month, the West Londoner has been trying to find a better balance between his religion and day-to-day life. During Ramadan, Muslims do things to strengthen their relationship with God, including fasting, giving to charity, and some avoid listening to music too. ""Ramadan is all about reflection and trying to be a better person,"" Zuu says. ""Obviously, with the jobs that I do, sometimes it overlaps what you can and can't do."" Zuu's probably best-known for his cooking shows, but he's also a member of the MTP Crew grime collective that AJ Tracey is part of. To follow Islamic teachings more closely, Zuu has posted less food and music content on socials over the past month. But he also believes that it is important to adapt the older aspects of his religion into a modern-day context. ""For me, it's just about my intention and making sure that I'm doing the right thing,"" he says. ""I'm trying to be a good person. I'm sure that's enough."" Big Zuu says people are sometimes surprised when they find out he's Muslim. He says that surprises him, given that his real name is Zuhair Hassan - ""one of the most Muslim names of all time"". But as a black man with a mum from Sierra Leone and a dad from Lebanon, he is not part of the faith's South Asian majority in the UK. ""Being in a mosque and being the odd one out, I guess it just comes with how I look,"" Zuu says. But he says that hasn't stopped him from ""always trying to be a good Muslim"". Zuu says this year has been particularly important for his religious identity. As part of a BBC documentary, he flew to Mecca in Saudi Arabia to complete the Islamic pilgrimage, Umrah. Having struggled to navigate what being Muslim means throughout his life, Zuu says undertaking this shorter version of Hajj was an emotional moment for him. ""I think documentaries like this are super-important to let people know there's different types of Muslims who look different and come from different backgrounds,"" he says. ""We're not all the same."" Travelling to the holiest city in Islam accompanied by his two best friends, Tubsey and Hyder, was ""intense"", but the documentary also gave Zuu a chance to grow. ""I definitely feel like it brought me closer to God and made me focus a little bit more on my faith,"" he says. ""All of that is just going to stick with me for life."" But this doesn't mean that Zuu will be completely getting rid of the ""little things"" he likes to indulge in. And with Wednesday marking the end of Ramadan and beginning of Eid celebrations, there's one thing in particular he's looking forward to. ""It's really bad,"" the chef says. ""I just love soft drinks. ""It's the little things that you miss."" Big Zuu Goes To Mecca will be broadcast on BBC Two at 9pm on Sunday 14 April and will be available to stream on BBC iPlayer after.

232,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68759436,"Chappell Roan is the freaky, fun pop star you need to know","Ring the alarm: Pop music is getting its sense of fun back, and it's all thanks to Chappell Roan. Her uproarious debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, came out last September, telling the story of a closeted, small-town girl finding her way in the world. Full of outrageous lyrical twists and scorching-hot melodies, it's also one of the horniest records in recent memory. The 26-year-old has sex in the passenger seat of a car, streaks down the streets of New York and makes out with her best friend, reasoning: ""We could go to hell, but we'll probably be fine."" That line is more autobiographical than it seems. Roan was brought up in the conservative city of Willard, Missouri, where she attended church three times a week and was taught that being gay was a sin. Moving to LA after signing a record deal opened her eyes. Immediately after visiting her first gay club, she wrote Pink Pony Club - a campy, liberated disco anthem that's become her calling card. But the singer isn't as promiscuous as her lyrics suggest. Chappell is actually the alter-ego of the much quieter and self-effacing Kayleigh Amstuzt, whose fragile heart is exposed on lachrymose ballads like Kaleidoscope and California . She describes Chappell as a ""larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself"", who allows her to be rebellious and risqué. ""I couldn't be Chappell all the time,"" she admits. ""I'd be absolutely exhausted."" If you haven't heard of her yet, don't worry. Her album only sold 3,000 copies in its first week, but word is starting to spread. After picking up several ""album of the year"" citations in late 2023, Roan booked appearances on Stephen Colbert's US chat show and NPR's influential Tiny Desk Concert (where she wore three wigs, held together with sticky tape and cigarette butts). In her review of the album, Pitchfork's Olivia Horn described it as an ""uproarious pop project stitched with stories about discovering love, sex, and oneself in a new place... buoyed by youthful vim and steely indifference to the bounds of good taste"". In a four-star review, NME's Hannah Mylrea praised the ""funny, irresistible songwriting"", but added the ""sharp pop moments shine brighter than some of the weaker ballads that pad out the lengthy tracklist"". Currently on tour with Olivia Rodrigo, Roan's just released a new single, Good Luck, Babe - and caught up with BBC News shortly before taking the stage in Pennsylvania. You grew up in America's conservative Bible belt. At what point did you go,"" I'm too big for this town, I'm off to LA !"" It was never that I was too big for the town, I just didn't feel like myself there. I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to, or talk how I wanted to. I always felt like I was too much. When I go back nowadays it's more comfortable. I realised it's just a town and people don't care as much as I thought they did. When did you start writing music? When I was a teenager in high school, so 14 or 15. I'd go to summer art camp and put cover songs on YouTube, and that's really how I got discovered. If I handed you a CD of those early songs now, would you play it or destroy it? Play it! I appreciate that version of myself. She was just so desperate in wanting to be understood, and she was not afraid to cry and wallow and be sad, which is something I've become avoidant of as I've grown older. She was also un-medicated and very mentally ill, as a lot of us were, but I love that she wasn't afraid to be fully emotional. It's interesting that you talk about her as though she was a different person. I feel like I moulted out of an old skin and I'm a new woman! I'm not that teenage girl any more, but she's the reason I am where I am now. You signed to Atlantic Records and moved to LA when you were 17. How did that affect you? It was very disorienting and shocking. I would cry in my car if people honked at me. It wasn't really until I was there four, five years that I really found myself in the queer community - all of the drag shows and the dancing and the clubs and the fun art stuff. That directly inspired Pink Pony Club... Tell me about the night that led to that song. I know how cliché this sounds, but I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven. It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies, and wearing these risqué things. And the Go-Go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, ""I have to do that"". I didn't become a Go-Go dancer, but I wrote a song about it! When the song didn't sell, you were dropped by your label. Did you think, ""That's it, I have to retrain as a dentist""? I did think about that! I ran out of money in LA, so I moved back in with my parents and worked at a drive-thru donut shop. I was like, ""Oh my God, this might actually be my life"". But I saved up some money, moved back to LA and gave myself a year. When did you realise it'd be OK? When I released Naked In Manhattan. It started doing well on TikTok, then I played my first headline show and everything clicked. I was like, ""Oh, this is more than just people listening on Spotify. This is like a party in real life"". Tell me about the Chappell character. Why did you decide to be her, instead of Kayleigh Amstutz? I just didn't think me as Kayleigh was exciting enough. So I invented this more interesting version of me, and I'm so glad I did. How much of Kayleigh is there hiding inside Chappell? I'm about 30% Kayleigh on the stage. But if I'm doing a song like Kaleidoscope, then I'm fully Kayleigh. Does the persona allow you to express things you'd be too shy for in real life? Like, I noticed you wrote about dating girls before you had a girlfriend. Exactly. It's something I wanted so bad, but I didn't know how to make it real. The songs ended up being a manifestation. On Coffee, you refuse to meet your ex-boyfriend for a drink, saying coffee would be safer. That's a brilliant little observation. It came from real life! I was going to meet my ex in New York and, the day before, I wrote that song as a warning to myself: If we drink anything other than coffee, I know where it's going to end up. And, surprise, we didn't get coffee and it ended up poorly. I had the intention, I just didn't follow through! You've described Good Luck, Babe as the start of your next era. Does that mean a second album is already on the way? I'm sure I'll come to an album but, for now, I'm just writing songs that I love and putting them out. What made this song the right one to kick off phase two? I love that it's a pop song with a sad element to it. It's very common in queer relationships, when someone is still coming to terms with their queerness, [that] they'll kiss 100 boys to ""stop the feeling"", as the song says. But you can't escape fate. The song's a little bit about myself and a little bit for the girls of my past, who'd tell me, ""I don't think I'm queer"". And it's like, ""Sure, OK. Your time will come."" Good Luck, Babe is out now. Chappell Roan tours the UK in September.",10 April 2024,entertainment
233,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68825752,Jeremy Bowen: Iran's attack on Israel offers Netanyahu a lifeline,"It wasn't many days ago that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was under enormous pressure. After seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen were killed by the Israeli army in Gaza on 1 April, US President Joe Biden seemed finally to lose patience with his troublesome ally. On the same day, Israel attacked the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing a senior general, at least six other officers, and violating legal conventions that prohibit attacks on embassies. Israel claimed, unconvincingly, that Iran had forfeited that protection by turning the consular building it destroyed into a military outpost. Iran promised it would retaliate, but previous attacks on senior commanders had generated more words than actions. Outside Iran, the attack on Damascus was overshadowed by the fury caused by the killing of the team from World Central Kitchen, a US-based charity. The White House issued a furious statement from President Biden. He was ""outraged and heartbroken"". It was not a standalone incident. Israel was not doing enough to protect aid workers or Palestinian civilians. In an angry call with the prime minister, he demanded major concessions. Gaza should be flooded with humanitarian aid. Israel must open more border crossings, as well as the container port in Ashdod, less than an hour's drive away from children starving to death in northern Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu promised that things would change. Despite that, Israel was stalling. As well as feeling the heat from the White House, Mr Netanyahu was also under pressure from the ultranationalist extremists whose backing in Israel's parliament keeps his coalition in power. Not only are they opposed to flooding Gaza with aid. They believe the war has presented Israel with a priceless opportunity to re-settle Jews in Gaza. Jewish settlements there were evacuated and demolished by Israel in 2005 as part of a unilateral withdrawal from the territory. By the end of last week, the US was increasing the pressure. On Thursday, Samantha Power, the top US humanitarian official, said it was ""credible"" that famine was already affecting parts of Gaza. It was apparent to Israel's friends as well as its enemies that its six-month siege of Gaza had created the world's most urgent food crisis. There was another burst of speculation that the US would put conditions on the use of the weapons it supplies to Israel. On Saturday morning, hours before the Iranian attack on Israel, The New York Times echoed deepening outrage , especially among prominent Democrats in the US Congress. It called for a pause in the supply of weapons to Israel and laid into Benjamin Netanyahu. Under the headline, Military Aid to Israel Cannot Be Unconditional, the paper's editorial board slammed Mr Netanyahu and the hardliners in his government for breaking ""the bond of trust"" with America. The US commitment to Israel, and its right to defend itself, did not mean that President Biden ""should allow Mr. Netanyahu to keep playing his cynical double games"", it said. Then Iran's first-ever direct attack on Israel offered the prime minister a lifeline. In a remarkable feat of military co-operation, the US and other Western allies helped Israel shoot down more than 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran. No Arab leader has been a sterner critic of Israel's war in Gaza than King Abdullah of Jordan. But Jordan's air force joined the operation, downing projectiles heading for Israel. Calls for putting conditions on military aid to Israel were replaced by resounding expressions of solidarity. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been presented with new political opportunities. Gaza is out of the headlines, for a day or two at least. But pressure on the prime minister has changed. It has not gone. Israel's next moves might redouble it. President Biden has made it very clear what he thinks should happen next. Israel should declare victory in this episode, ""take the win"", and not hit back. He declared, again, that America's support for Israel was ""ironclad"". That fitted in to his consistent policy since the Hamas attacks on 7 October. The president and his administration have worked hard to stop a wider, all-out war in the Middle East, even as they funnelled massive supplies of arms to Israel that have been used to devastating and deadly effect in Gaza. Since October Israel has accepted the weapons and the diplomatic support that accompanied them and ignored Joe Biden's increasingly desperate and angry calls to respect the laws of war and protect civilians. Just a few days after unprecedented military co-operation from its allies against Iran, Israel looks once again to be bent on ignoring not just Joe Biden's advice not to retaliate, but very similar sentiments from the other countries that helped out on Saturday night. Just like Joe Biden, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Britain and President Emmanuel Macron in France deployed combat aircraft, both condemned Iran, and both have urged Israel not to hit back. They are coming up against long-held beliefs and instincts in Israel. One is the deep conviction that Israel's survival depends on responding to attacks with overwhelming force. Another is Benjamin Netanyahu's view, expressed many times over his years in power, that Iran is Israel's most dangerous enemy, bent on the destruction of the Jewish state. Many Israelis share that view. Now, after years of enmity since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has for the first time mounted a direct attack on Israel. A long clandestine war has come out of the shadows. Israel has said the question is not if it will hit back, but when and how. The war cabinet has been debating how to do it without igniting an all-out war. In the end, though, any attack will gamble that Iran does not want all-out war either, and will respond accordingly. That is a dangerous assumption. Both sides have already badly misjudged the other's intentions. Once again, Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are bent on ignoring the wishes of allies who have gone the extra mile to help Israel against its enemies. His ultranationalist allies are demanding a crushing attack on Iran. One of them said Israel should ""go berserk"". At the same time the humanitarian catastrophe continues in Gaza. International attention has swung away from it but will return. Israel's military is still operating in Gaza and still killing civilians. Deadly violence between Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the West Bank has surged again. Israel's border war with Hezbollah could escalate fast. Iran has vowed to retaliate more strongly if Israel attacks. The chief of staff of its armed forces, Hossein Baqeri, said the attack on Israel had been ""limited"" and promised a ""far greater"" response if Israel retaliated. The Americans have said they will not assist if Israel attacks Iran. But it is hard to believe that Joe Biden's definition of an ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel's security would keep the US on the sidelines if Iran answered an Israeli attack with another of its own. The slide continues towards a wider war in the Middle East and a deeper global crisis.",2 days ago,politics
234,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68820959,Israeli war cabinet meets to discuss response to Iranian attack,"Israel's war cabinet has met to discuss its response to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack. Officials did not make public whether a decision had been reached. Israel's allies have strongly condemned Iran's actions, but urged Benjamin Netanyahu's government to show restraint. While Iran has signalled it considers the matter closed, the Israeli military's chief of staff said the attack would not go unanswered. ""Look, as we look forward, we weigh our steps, and this launch of so many missiles, cruise missiles, UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] to the territory of the State of Israel will be met with a response,"" Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said. He did not specify a course of action, or give a timescale. Former CIA head David Petraeus told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme that Washington does not want to risk the wellbeing of the global economy with any Israeli retaliation against Iran. Gen Petraeus, who as a US Army general also commanded forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the Iranian attack was a ""very big deal"", and that the West had to understand how significant this was for Israel. ""The challenge now, of course, is that there are somewhat different perspectives on what to do next. If, for some reason, the Brent crude prices spike, or if there is some kind of freedom of navigation issue in the Gulf. And there is already some concern over Iran taking an oil tanker the other day."" Gen Petraeus, who is now retired , said the debate inside the Israeli government was about how to formulate a response that would show Israeli deterrence without ""ratcheting up the escalation any further"". He added that Israel had a number of asymmetric options that could allow it to respond without increasing tension. Lt Gen Halevi was speaking from Nevatim air base in southern Israel, which sustained damage in Saturday's overnight attack but was said by Israel to be ""still functioning"". Tehran said the operation was retaliation for a 1 April strike on its consulate in Syria, which killed senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders. The Israeli military said more than 300 drones and missiles were launched at Israel. It said almost all were brought down by its forces, with support from the US, UK, France and other countries, before reaching their targets. No deaths were reported and Israel said the damage was limited. World leaders have urged restraint amid concerns about a major escalation in tensions in the Middle East. US President Joe Biden spoke to Mr Netanyahu following the launch of the Iranian attack and reaffirmed ""America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel"". But on Sunday, the US told Israel it would not join in any counter-strike on Iran, according to a senior White House official. ""We're committed to a ceasefire that will bring the hostages home and prevent the conflict spreading more than it already has,"" Mr Biden said on Monday, referring to the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The war began when Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking about 250 others to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded with an aerial and ground campaign, and more than 33,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health authority. Addressing Iran-Israel tensions in the UK Parliament on Monday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called on ""all sides"" to ""show restraint"". He added that he would speak to Mr Netanyahu to express solidarity and discuss how to prevent ""further escalation"". Separately on Monday, violence continued to surge in the occupied West Bank following the killing of an Israeli teenager, Benjamin Achimeir. The 14-year-old had taken a flock of sheep out to graze from a settler outpost near Ramallah when he went missing on Friday last week. The Israel Defense Forces later found his body. The Israeli government has said he was the victim of a ""terrorist attack"". The US has condemned retaliatory violence by Israeli settlers, which it said included the killings of two Palestinians - Jihad Abu Aliya, 25, and Omar Ahmad Abdulghani Hamed, 17. On Monday, Israel said it would investigate the killings of two more Palestinians near the city of Nablus, apparently by Israeli settlers.",2 days ago,politics

Rishi Sunak had been due to host the annual event and said he was ""looking forward"" to hosting Muslim figures. However, his office said he had parliamentary business to attend to - he was making a statement on Iran in the House of Commons . About half of the usual number attended the reception. Earlier, foreign secretary David Cameron had publicly urged people to go to the event. Of those who did turn up, many wore small badges with the Palestinian flag on and others wore wrist or hair bands made from keffiyeh - traditional Palestinian scarves. None of the ""big name"" guests were at the reception, including Baroness Warsi, the Conservative peer. She was Britain's first female Muslim cabinet minister, and has been outspoken in her criticism over the plight of people in Gaza. Major Muslim charities and significant Muslim business figures all stayed away from the reception. It was said by those attending that the gathering was ""about half the size as normal with around 50 people there"" - and they were ""surprised"" Mr Sunak did not attend. The event is held every year, and the prime minister has always hosted it. In a statement issued by Downing Street on Sunday, a spokesperson said Mr Sunak ""looks forward to welcoming members of the Muslim community"". Guests were instead greeted by deputy foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell. Some of the guests said they had ""toyed over"" whether to go. Many said they spoke to family over the weekend to decide whether it was the right thing to attend. One woman said she did not want to miss out on being invited to Downing Street for the first time but wanted to make it clear the situation in Gaza ""has not been forgotten"". Another said he had been to the event for years, and ""thought about it, thought what it was about. And what I thought was 'Downing Street is marking Eid, and it is a celebration I believe in'"". ""So I came. I understand why so many boycotted - but for me the right thing was to come,"" he said. Guests leaving the event said they saw ""no MPs"". ""I saw parliamentary candidates, but no MPs. They may have been there but I didn't see them."" The tranche of no-shows represent what is thought to be the first significant boycott of its kind at a Downing Street event. It follows a similar boycott of an annual Iftar at the White House earlier this month by American Muslims angry at US support for Israel.

The PM said he would speak to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu to express solidarity and also discuss how to prevent ""further escalation"". Mr Sunak told MPs Iran's actions had been ""reckless and dangerous"". Tehran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for a deadly air strike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel said 99% of the projectiles had been intercepted with help from allies - including the US, UK and Jordan. In a statement in the House of Commons, Mr Sunak confirmed the RAF had intercepted ""a number of Iranian drones"" and said the air force was ""the best of the best"". He said Iran had ""once again shown its true colours"" and its attack had been intent on ""further destabilising the Middle East"". ""Saturday's attack was the act not of the people but of a despotic regime, and it is emblematic of the dangers that we face today,"" Mr Sunak said, adding that threats to stability were ""growing, not just in the Middle East but everywhere"". He said the UK was ""working urgently with our allies to de-escalate the situation and prevent further bloodshed"". ""We want to see calmer heads prevail and we're directing all our diplomatic efforts to that end,"" Mr Sunak said. Turning to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, he said ""nothing that has happened over the last 48 hours affects our position on Gaza"". Mr Sunak said it was ""Israel's right, and indeed it's duty, to defeat the threat from Hamas"" but also reiterated his calls for a ""long-term and sustainable ceasefire"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he ""welcomed the prime minister's call for restraint"" and that the attack ""left the world a more dangerous place"". He added: ""If diplomacy takes centre stage, and it must, then we also need to be clear diplomatic premises should not be targeted and attacked. That is a point of principle."" The strike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers officers, including a top commander. The Iranian government has accused Israel of carrying out that attack, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied it. Earlier, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told the BBC the UK had joined Israel's defence against Iran in order to prevent an escalation of the conflict. He said the attack - which he described as a ""double defeat"" for Iran because it had been ""almost wholly unsuccessful"" and also showed they were a ""malign influence in the region"" - could have resulted in thousands of casualties and led to greater escalation had it been successful. Lord Cameron urged Israel to be ""smart"" and ""tough"" as it considers its response. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former prime minister added that Israel should turn its focus once more to the situation in Gaza and securing a deal to get the hostages home. Lord Cameron added that the UK did not support a retaliatory strike, echoing US President Joe Biden's comment that Israel should ""take the win"". The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock have also called for calm, while French President Emmanuel Macron said France would do everything possible to avoid what he described as a regional conflagration. Israel's cabinet and opposition leaders have met in Tel Aviv to consider their response to the attack. Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said Iran's attacks would be ""met with a response"" and said Israel was considering its next steps. Earlier, a spokesperson for the UK prime minister said the country and its allies were ""clearly not briefed"" by Tehran, in response to Iran's assertion that it gave advanced warning of the attack. Attack drones were intercepted by the RAF in Syrian and Iraqi airspace, where it was already operating with the US as part of the Operation Shader mission against the Islamic State group. Lord Cameron confirmed the UK's role was to ""backfill"" for the US and the RAF had agreed to shoot down Iranian drones if they came through that airspace. The Ministry of Defence has not said how many RAF Typhoons were airborne, nor how many weapons it shot down. The war in Gaza was triggered after waves of Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas and has launched retaliatory operations in Gaza which have killed more than 33,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu had been coming under increasing international pressure over how his government was handling the conflict, including over allowing more access to aid.",3 days ago,politics
237,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68812949,Oil prices lower after Iran attack on Israel,"Oil prices fell on Monday after Iran's reprisal attack on Israel over the weekend. Brent crude - a key benchmark for oil prices internationally - was lower but still trading close to $90 a barrel. Prices had already risen in expectation of action by Iran, with Brent crude nearing a six-month high last week. Analysts said the markets would be looking to see how the conflict could affect global supply chains. Oil price fluctuations can cause ripple effects across the world due to countries being heavily reliant on the commodity, which is used to produce fuels such as petrol and diesel. Fuel and energy prices have been a major driver behind the higher cost of living worldwide in the past couple of years. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, oil prices soared to $120 a barrel over supply fears as western nations imposed sanctions on Russia, one of the world's major oil exporters. The jump led to not only higher prices at the pumps, but also countless other goods as businesses adjusted their prices to cover higher costs. Analysts said Israel's reaction to the attack would be key for global markets in the days and weeks ahead. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said the confrontation with Iran is ""not over yet"". His comments came after Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel at the weekend after vowing retaliation for an attack on its consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus on 1 April. Israel has not said it carried out the consulate strike, but is widely believed to have been behind it. At the end of last week, the price of Brent crude touched $92.18 a barrel, the highest since October, but on Monday it fell back to around $89.50. The price of gold - often seen as a safe investment at times of uncertainty - also dropped. After hitting a record high of $2,431.29 an ounce on Friday, gold fell back to $2,332.97 on Monday. Energy analyst Vandana Hari said the fall in the price of oil meant ""clearly, the oil market does not see the need to factor in any additional supply threat at this point"". But Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com said he expected the energy market to be volatile and predicted that oil prices would surge if Israel responded strongly to Iran's move. However, April LaRusse, head of investment at Insight Investment, said it was likely that markets would ""trade sideways until we have more information"". ""Unfortunately this situation in the Middle East has been going on for some time and the longer you have a bit of geo-political tension going on the more markets wait to see and there isn't sort of a panic reaction as the first move,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. Share markets in the Asia-Pacific region slipped on Monday as investors weighed the impact of the attack. The UK's FTSE 100 share index also fell marginally. Russ Mould, investment director at investment firm AJ Bell, said the markets had ""started the week with relative calm"". However, he said there was a ""continuing nervousness among investors"". ""The situation remains fraught and, beyond the geopolitical and humanitarian implications, a more widespread conflict in the Middle East could see energy prices surge and unpick central banks' careful efforts to bring down inflation,"" he added. Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and the third-largest member of the Opec oil producers' cartel. Analysts say that a key issue for the oil price going forward is whether shipping through the Strait of Hormuz will be affected. The Strait - which is between Oman and Iran - is a crucial shipping route, as about 20% of the world's total oil supply passes through it. Opec members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq send most of the oil they export through the Strait. On Saturday, Iran seized a commercial ship with links to Israel as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz.",3 days ago,politics

Some politicians, business leaders and charity representatives said they would boycott the event in protest against the government's support of Israel . Lord Cameron said he hosted a celebration at the Foreign Office a few days ago and ""ambassadors from every Arab country turned up"". The foreign secretary said: ""All these religious festivals are a time to put aside political differences and think of the things that bring us together. ""And one of the things that brings us together in Britain is that we're a country with an established church, but also a country that respects other faiths and respects other celebrations, and I think that's the right thing to do. ""So I'd urge people who get that nice invitation to go to No 10 Downing Street, whether it's Diwali, whether it's Eid, whether it's Easter, they're always very good parties and very well done and I'd encourage people to go."" Baroness Warsi is among those expected to avoid the event. The Conservative peer was Britain's first female Muslim cabinet minister, and has been outspoken in her criticism over the plight of people in Gaza. She quit as Foreign Office Minister in David Cameron's cabinet in 2014 , saying the government's policy over Gaza was ""morally indefensible"". Israeli military action in Gaza, sparked by Hamas's 7 October attack, has caused widespread devastation and killed more than 33,000 Palestinians. A government spokesperson said it understood humanitarian concerns regarding Gaza. Sources in Downing Street have privately expressed concern at the number of people who might boycott the reception. Asif Ansari, a leading businessman and charity fundraiser, said: ""As a Muslim, I think it's very important for the Muslim community to have good relations with the British government. ""However, I feel very, very strongly this year with the position that the British government is taking. ""They are supporting Israel who stand accused of genocide, they stand accused of war crimes, the deprivation of water and food to women and children has left many starving and lastly, the killing of three British aid workers - after which Lord Cameron has said the UK would continue to supply arms to Israel - was an absolute red line.""

239,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68737412,Gaza war: Where does Israel get its weapons?,"Western governments are coming under growing pressure to halt arms sales to Israel over how it is waging the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel is a major weapons exporter, but its military has been heavily reliant on imported aircraft, guided bombs and missiles to conduct what experts have described as one of the most intense and destructive aerial campaigns in recent history. Campaign groups and some politicians among Israel's Western allies say arms exports should be suspended because, they say, Israel is failing to do enough to protect the lives of civilians and ensure enough humanitarian aid reaches them. On Friday, the UN Human Rights Council backed a weapons ban, with 28 countries voting in favour, six against and 13 abstentions. The US and Germany - which account for the vast majority of Israel's arms imports - both voted against. Germany said it did so because the resolution did not explicitly condemn Hamas. The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, according Israeli tallies. More than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza, 70% of them children and women, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel insists that its forces are working to avoid civilian casualties, accuses Hamas of deliberately putting civilians in the line of fire and has said there are no limits on aid deliveries. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) , the US accounted for 69% of Israel's imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023. The US provides Israel with $3.8bn (£3bn) in annual military aid under a 10-year agreement that is intended to allow its ally to maintain what it calls a ""qualitative military edge"" over neighbouring countries. Israel has used the grants to finance orders of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, a stealth aircraft considered the most advanced ever made. It has so far ordered 75 and taken delivery of more than 30 of the aircraft. It was the first country other than the US to receive an F-35 and the first to use one in combat. Part of the aid - $500m annually - is set aside to fund missile defence programmes, including the jointly developed Iron Dome, Arrow and David's Sling systems. Israel has relied on them during the war to defend itself against rocket, missile and drone attacks by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, as well as other Iran-backed armed groups based in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. In the days after Hamas's 7 October attack, President Joe Biden said the US was ""surging additional military assistance"" to Israel. Since the start of the war, only two US military sales to Israel have been made public after receiving emergency approval - one for 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth $106m and the other for $147m of components to make 155mm artillery shells. But US media report that President Joe Biden's administration has also quietly made more than 100 military sales to Israel, most falling below the dollar amount that would require Congress to be formally notified. They are said to include thousands of precision-guided munitions, small-diameter bombs, bunker busters and small arms . However, SIPRI's report says that despite the deliveries, the total volume of Israeli arms imports from the US in 2023 was almost the same as in 2022. One deal that is large enough to require Congressional notification is the $18bn sale of up to 50 F-15 fighter jets, news about which emerged this week . Congress has not yet approved the deal. Even though the aircraft would need to be built from scratch and would not be delivered immediately, the sale is expected to be hotly debated by Mr Biden's Democratic Party, many of whose representatives in Congress and supporters are increasingly concerned by Israel's actions in Gaza. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she is prepared to block the deal and has accused Israel of ""indiscriminate bombing"" in Gaza. Germany is the next biggest arms exporter to Israel, accounting for 30% of imports between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI. In 2023, the European nation's weapons sales to Israel were worth €326.5m ($351m; £280m) - a 10-fold increase compared with 2022 - with the majority of those export licences granted after the 7 October attacks. The German government said in January that the sales comprised €306.4m worth of military equipment and €20.1m of ""war weapons"". According to the DPA news agency , the latter included 3,000 portable anti-tank weapons and 500,000 rounds of ammunition for automatic or semi-automatic firearms. It also said that most of the export licences were granted for land vehicles and technology for the development, assembly, maintenance and repair of weapons. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a staunch supporter of Israel's right to self-defence throughout the war and, although his tone on Israeli actions in Gaza has shifted in recent weeks and there has been some debate in Germany, the arms sales do not appear to be at risk of suspension. Italy is the third-biggest arms exporter to Israel, but it accounted for only 0.9% of Israeli imports between 2019 and 2023. They have reportedly included helicopters and naval artillery. Sales of ""arms and munitions"" amounted to €13.7m ($14.8m; £11.7m) last year, the magazine Altreconomia cited national statistics bureau ISTAT as saying . Some €2.1m of exports were approved between October and December , despite the government's assurances that it was blocking them under a law which bans weapons sales to countries that are waging war or are deemed to be violating human rights. Defence Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament last month that Italy had honoured existing contracts after checking them on a case-by-case basis and ensuring ""they did not concern materials that could be used against civilians"". The UK's exports of military goods to Israel are ""relatively small"", according to the UK government, amounting to only £42m ($53m) in 2022 . The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel worth £574m ($727m) in total. Much of those are for components used in US-made warplanes that end up in Israel. But the British government is coming under growing pressure to suspend even those exports. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK has a ""very careful export licensing regime"" and said Israel must ""act in accordance with international humanitarian law"". The UK government is also preparing an assessment that will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law in its actions from early 2024. But a senior government source told the BBC that an arms embargo on Israel was ""not going to happen"". The government of Canada, whose arms sales to Israel were worth 21.3m Canadian dollars ($15.7m; £12.4m) in 2022, said in January that it had suspended approving new exit permits for weapons until it could ensure they were being used in accordance with Canadian law. However, pre-existing permits remained valid. Israel has also built up its own defence industry with US help and now ranks as the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world, with a focus on advanced technological products rather than large-scale hardware. It held a 2.3% share of global sales between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI, with India (37%), the Philippines (12%) and the US (8.7%) the three main recipients. The sales were worth $12.5bn (£9.9bn) in 2022 , according to the Israeli defence ministry. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) made up 25% of those exports, followed by missiles, rockets and air defence systems (19%) and radar and electronic warfare systems (13%), the ministry said. In September, just before the war began, Germany agreed a $3.5bn deal with Israel to buy the sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defence system, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles. The deal - Israel's largest-ever - had to be approved by the US because it jointly developed the system. Israel is also home to a vast US arms depot set up in 1984 to pre-position supplies for its troops in case of a regional conflict, as well as to give Israel quick access to weapons in emergencies. The Pentagon shipped about 300,000 155mm artillery shells from the War Reserve Stockpile Ammunition-Israel to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. Stockpiled munitions at the depot have also reportedly been supplied to Israel since the start of the Gaza war.",3 days ago,politics
240,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68813496,US tells Israel it won't join any retaliatory strikes on Iran,"The White House has warned Israel that the US will not participate in any retaliatory strikes on Iran, senior administration officials have said. Over 300 drones and missiles were fired at Israel overnight, which Iran said was in response to an 1 April strike on its consulate in Syria. Almost all weapons were shot down by Israeli, US and allied forces before they reached their targets. Officials said Joe Biden urged Israel to consider its response ""carefully"". Speaking to reporters on Sunday, a senior administration official said that Mr Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ""think very carefully and strategically"" about how his forces replied to the unprecedented action, the first direct attack by Iran on the country. The official added that the Biden administration believes Israel ""got the best of it"" in the exchange, which began when senior Iranian military commanders were killed at an Iranian consular building in Syria. About 99% of the missiles, drones and cruise missiles launched during Iran's retaliatory operation were shot down or intercepted - which US officials point to as a sign of Israeli military superiority over Iran. US aircraft and naval vessels shot down dozens of Iranian projectiles as the attack took place. More than 80 drones and at least six ballistic missiles were downed by US aircraft and vessels or by air defence forces over Iraq. This includes seven drones and a ballistic missile as they prepared to launch from Yemen, US Central Command (Centcom) added in an update on Sunday. A conversation took place between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu at a time ""of heightened emotion"" just after the attack, which included about 100 ballistic missiles simultaneously flying towards Israel. During the call, the two leaders had a discussion ""about how to slow things down and think through things"", with Mr Biden emphasising that Israel has ""gotten the best of it"". The official declined to say, however, whether the White House warned against a significant response, saying only that ""it is a calculation the Israelis have to make"". In a string of television appearances on US networks earlier in the day, national security spokesman John Kirby repeatedly said that the US had made it clear to Israel that it seeks to avoid a wider conflict. The senior administration said that the same message has been sent to Iran through diplomatic channels. Both Mr Kirby and the official said that the US would continue to defend Israel, but has ruled out participating in any Israeli response. The stance is one that has sparked criticism from some US lawmakers and former officials from both sides of the political spectrum. Ohio Republican Representative Mike Turner, who serves as chair of the House intelligence committee, said that Mr Kirby's comments about de-escalating the conflict were ""wrong"". ""It is already escalating, and the administration needs to respond,"" he said on NBC. And John Bolton, who served as national security adviser under President Donald Trump, said the US should join Israel if its chose to launch a retaliatory attack on Iran's nuclear programme. ""I think it [Israel] can destroy or disable a very substantial part [of the programme], if not totally,"" he told NewsNation. ""Frankly, if Israel is prepared to go after Iran's nuclear programme, the United States should proudly join them."" In the wake of Iran's attack on Israel, Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, said that the body would ""try again"" to pass military aid for Israel. Previous attempts to send more aid to Israel have stalled amid Democratic calls that the aid package should also include assistance for Taiwan and Ukraine. Mick Mulroy, a former Deputy Secretary of Defence for the Middle East, told the BBC that aid for Israel should be passed ""without delay"". ""If it wasn't for US security assistance, we could be facing a major regional war,"" he said. ""That supplement and the ones for Ukraine and Taiwan are in our national security interest. It is not charity. It's part of the US national defence.""",3 days ago,politics
241,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68812884,"Bowen: As Israel debates Iran attack response, can US and allies stop slide into all-out war?","Israel's war cabinet has used a tried-and-trusted phrase to describe its next moves against Iran. Israel would respond ""in the manner and at the time of our choosing"". Benny Gantz, the opposition leader who joined the war cabinet after the Hamas attacks of 7 October, emphasised the cohesion of Israel and its western allies. ""Israel against Iran, the world against Iran. This is the result. That is a strategic achievement which we must leverage for Israel's security."" The words Mr Gantz used did not rule out another attack on an Iranian target, or a first overt Israeli strike inside Iran (Israel has hit Iran's nuclear programme repeatedly, with cyber-attacks and the assassination of officials and scientists). But there might be time for the diplomatic response President Joe Biden wants from the meeting he has called of the G7, the richest western countries. This most recent escalation of the war that has spread across the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel began two weeks ago, when Israel attacked Iran's embassy compound in Damascus. The air strike, on 1 April, killed a senior general, his number two and other aides. The decision to attack was not coordinated with the Americans. Israel must have assessed the opportunity to kill senior commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) as a risk worth taking. Publicly Israel offers an unconvincing argument that the presence of senior military officers on diplomatic premises made the building a legitimate target. More importantly is the fact that Iran chose to interpret the airstrike as an attack on its own ground. Very quickly, it was clear that Iran would respond. Iran's message was not transmitted with nudges and winks, but in unequivocal statements from its supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel, the US and their allies had plenty of warning. Mr Biden had time to get back to the White House from a weekend trip to his home state of Delaware. Iran chose to open the attack not with supersonic ballistic missiles, but with slow drones, that were on radar screens for two hours as they approached their targets. It was a bigger attack than many analysts expected from Israel's most bitter enemy; plenty of reasons for many Israelis to expect a response from their own side. For the first time Iran launched weapons - around 300 drones, cruise and ballistic missiles - from its own territory at Israel's. Almost all of them were stopped by formidable air defences; Israel's own considerable capabilities, bolstered by the US, UK and Jordan. Their allies, especially the US, helped them out enormously over the course of the night. President Joe Biden reiterated his promise: ""ironclad"" security for Israel, essentially saying 'we've got your back'. In return, the Americans want restraint from Israel. President Biden sent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a clear message. Iran's attack has been thwarted, Israel has a victory, so do not escalate this any further by responding with military strikes on Iranian soil. A senior western diplomat told me that it was now vital to draw a line, to stop further escalation. Drawing a line seems to be Iran's hope too. It has signalled that Israel's attack in Damascus has been answered; it will only escalate further if it is attacked again. The Iranians seem to want to cool the two weeks of crisis and threats that started with the Israeli strike on their diplomatic compound in Damascus. Perhaps Iran was hoping to do more damage than it did. Or it may have been open about its plans to give Israel less reason to hit back. Iran wanted to restore the sense of deterrence it lost when Israel attacked the compound in Damascus. That might be harder after Israel and its allies stopped almost all the projectiles launched their way. It was not a full-scale attack on Israel. Iran has been building up its rocket and missile forces for years. It could have fired many more weapons. Hezbollah in Lebanon would have joined in with an all-out offensive, and it did not. The Lebanese militia and political movement is Iran's strongest ally, with an arsenal of rockets and missiles. Prime Minister Netanyahu might draw some satisfaction with the way that the Iran attack removed Gaza from the headlines. It gives him a respite from the humanitarian catastrophe, and Israel's failure to achieve its war aims of freeing the hostages and crushing Hamas. A few days ago, international focus was on the rift between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu over the famine created by Israel's blockade of Gaza. Now they talk about unity. Mr Netanyahu can also present himself as a resolute and reasonable leader, the protector of his people even though his many enemies in Israel want him out of office. They say his rash, unsafe policies before 7 October led Hamas to believe Israel was vulnerable. What has not changed is that the Americans want to find a way to stop the slide to an all-out Middle East war. Red lines have been crossed - Israel's attack on a diplomatic site, and Iran's direct attack on Israel. Immediately, some Israeli right-wingers demanded a response. Those calls will not stop. The job of the diplomats at the G7 will be to prevent the region entering a damaging wider conflict. The slide has been slow, but also steady and in one direction, towards disaster, in the six months since Hamas attacked Israel. If Israel takes President Biden's advice not to hit back, the Middle East might be able to take a breath. It is by no means certain that this is the end of this dangerous episode.",4 days ago,politics

The UK was one of several countries, including the US, which helped counter Iran's unprecedented attack - its first ever direct strike on Israeli soil. Additional RAF jets were deployed over Iraq and Syria, not Israel, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. Mr Sunak, who condemned Iran's ""reckless attack"", will join G7 leaders on Sunday to discuss next steps. Speaking to journalists in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said if Iran's attack on Israel been successful ""the fallout for regional stability would be hard to overstate"". He did not specify how many drones were shot down by British forces. Attack drones were intercepted by the RAF in Syrian and Iraqi airspace, where it was already operating as part of the Operation Shader mission against the Islamic State group. The MoD did not say how many RAF Typhoons were airborne but said the RAF would repel ""any airborne attacks within range"" of its operations in the region. Iran launched hundreds of aerial drones and cruise missiles at Israel overnight on Saturday and into Sunday, in a widely anticipated retaliatory attack. The Israeli military said it had intercepted the majority of the attacks - mostly outside of Israel's airspace - with the help of other countries. The US was one of those allies, with President Biden confirming the US military helped Israel shoot down ""nearly all"" of Iran's drones and missiles. Jordan also assisted in taking out some Iranian drones, according to security sources cited by the Reuters news agency. Mr Sunak said it was clear Iran was ""determined to sow discontent and destabilise the region, its own backyard"". He went on to pledge the UK's continued support for the security of Israel and the wider region and called for ""calm heads to prevail"". ""We'll be working with our allies to de-escalate the situation and I look forward to speaking to G7 leaders this afternoon,"" he said. Iran's attacks come after Tehran vowed to retaliate over a strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, which killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers, including a top commander. The Iranian government has accused Israel of carrying out that attack, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied it. Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron demanded Tehran ""de-escalate"" following a call with his Iranian counterpart, and also urged the release of MSC Aries - the cargo ship which was seized by Iran as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday. Writing on social media, Lord Cameron said he had ""formally condemned in the strongest terms Iran's attack on Israel"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party supported all measures ""designed to restore calm"" and prevent a wider regional war. In a statement, he condemned Iran's ""decision to subject Israelis to these unacceptable attacks"".

The annual event, hosted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is set to take place in Downing Street on Monday. The BBC understands some invitees will not go in protest of Israel's military action in Gaza. A government spokesperson said it understood humanitarian concerns regarding Gaza. Sources in Downing Street have privately expressed concern at the number of people who might boycott the reception. The BBC understands Baroness Warsi is one of the Conservative politicians planning to boycott the event, along with at least two Tory MPs. She quit as Foreign Office Minister in David Cameron's cabinet in 2014 , saying the government's policy over Gaza was ""morally indefensible"". Asif Ansari, a leading businessman and charity fundraiser, said: ""As a Muslim, I think it's very important for the Muslim community to have good relations with the British government. ""However, I feel very, very strongly this year with the position that the British government is taking. ""They are supporting Israel who stand accused of genocide, they stand accused of war crimes, the deprivation of water and food to women and children has left many starving and lastly, the killing of three British aid workers - after which Lord Cameron has said the UK would continue to supply arms to Israel - was an absolute red line."" One person from a charity who has decided to attend, said they were going because ""I believe it is important to engage with the government at this time of conflict"". Earlier this month the prime minister faced growing pressure over UK arms sales to Israel, after the killing of seven aid workers by an Israeli strike in Gaza. At the time he said the UK had a ""very careful"" arms licensing regime and Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron later confirmed UK arms sales to Israel would not be suspended . Israel has justified its actions based on the Hamas attacks on 7 October, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people. A similar event held during Ramadan hosted by President Biden was subjected to a boycott of the White House earlier this month by those protesting US support for Israel. A No10 spokesperson said: ""The prime minister looks forward to welcoming members of the Muslim community to the Eid reception in Downing Street later this week and celebrating their contribution to public life.

Humza Yousaf said that all parties in the Middle East should abide by UN Security Council resolutions and implement an immediate ceasefire. He added that ""violence begets violence"" and that civilians in the region had already ""paid far too high a price"". The first minister stood by his calls to end UK arms sales to Israel. Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel, the country's military said. Other projectiles were fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Tehran's attack is a retaliation for an Israeli strike that killed Iranian military commanders in Damascus earlier this month. But it also comes after months of warfare between Israel and Hamas after the group attacked Israel on 7 October. Mr Yousaf has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the region and has criticised Israel's response to Hamas's attacks on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. Israel's military launched an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in that campaign, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Speaking on Sunday morning, Mr Yousaf said the ""vast majority"" of those killed in the conflict in Gaza were innocent women and children. He said that Israel had an advanced military and could defend itself without UK-made arms. Mr Yousaf urged against escalation in the region. ""It's not men in their suits in governments that pay the price for that escalation, it is innocent civilians."" he said. The UK government has confirmed that RAF fighter jets took part in the defence of Israel, shooting down a number of drones fired from Iran.

More than 300 drones and missiles were launched at Israel by Iran overnight, following the 1 April Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Syria. Israel said it and allies had intercepted 99% of the weapons. It marked Iran's first direct attack on Israel, with the two countries having waged a years-long shadow war. World leaders have urged restraint amid concerns about a major escalation in tensions in the Middle East. Following the attack, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed ""together we will win"", but it is unclear how his country plans to respond. Last week, Israel's defence and foreign ministers warned that if Iran attacked Israel, Israel would strike back inside Iran. An attack had been anticipated after the strike on the Damascus consulate killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officers. In a statement reported by AFP, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said ""if the Zionist regime [Israel] or its supporters demonstrate reckless behaviour, they will receive a decisive and much stronger response"". Iran's IRGC - the most powerful branch of its armed forces - said it had launched the attack ""in retaliation against the Zionist regime's [Israel] repeated crimes, including the attack on the Iranian embassy's consulate in Damascus"". Following the strikes the Iranian mission to the UN said ""the matter can be deemed concluded"". Iranian armed forces chief of staff Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri told state TV the US had been warned - via Switzerland - that American backing of an Israeli retaliation would result in US regional bases being targeted. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said he had told the US attacks against Israel will be ""limited"" and for self-defence, Reuters news agency reported. US President Joe Biden spoke to Mr Netanyahu following the launch of the Iranian attack and reaffirmed ""America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel"". He condemned the ""unprecedented"" attack on Israel and said the US had helped Israel and other allies to ""take down nearly all"" of the missiles and drones. Sirens sounded across Israel and loud explosions were heard over Jerusalem, with air defence systems shooting down objects over the city. The New York Times, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reported that the main targets appeared to be military instillations in the occupied Golan Heights. An Israeli military spokesman said around 360 munitions had been fired - including 170 explosive drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles - but Israel has said very little damage had been done. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said some Iranian missiles had hit inside Israel, causing minor damage to a military base but no casualties. He said a 10-year-old Bedouin girl had been severely injured by shrapnel from falling debris in the southern Arad region. World leaders will be considering their response to the major escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran, with many condemning the attack or warning of the dangers of escalation. Mr Biden said he would convene ""my fellow G7 leaders to co-ordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran's brazen attack"".

UN Secretary General António Guterres issued a statement saying he ""strongly condemn[ed] the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel"" by Iran. He called for ""an immediate cessation of these hostilities"" and for all sides to exercise maximum restraint. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the strikes ""reckless"", while the European Union's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said it was a ""grave threat to regional security"". China's foreign ministry urged restraint, characterising it as ""the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict"", while Russia's foreign ministry expressed ""extreme concern over another dangerous escalation"". On Sunday, France recommended its citizens in Iran should temporarily leave the country due to the risk of military escalation.

There have been increased tensions in the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed 33,729 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Meanwhile Israel's spy agency Mossad said Hamas negotiators had rejected the most recent proposal put forward by mediators in peace talks. In a statement it said this proved Hamas' Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar ""does not want a humanitarian deal and the return of the hostages"" and was ""continuing to exploit the tension with Iran"".

Iran said the assault was in response to a deadly attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago. Where this goes next from here depends in large part on how Israel decides to respond to last night's attack. Countries in the region and elsewhere, including those that deeply dislike the Iranian regime, have urged restraint. Iran's position is along the lines of: ""Account settled, that is the end of the matter, do not hit back at us or we will mount a much stronger attack against you that you will not be able to ward off."" But, Israel has already vowed ""a significant response"" and its government has often been called one of the most hardline in Israeli history. It responded to the murderous Hamas-led attacks of 7 October on southern Israel within hours and then spent the next six months battering the Gaza Strip. Israel's war cabinet is unlikely to leave this direct attack from Iran unanswered, however calibrated and limited its effect has been on the ground. So what are Israel's options? It could listen to its neighbours in the region and exercise what is known as ""strategic patience"", holding off from responding in kind and instead continuing to target Iran's proxy allies in the region such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or military supply sites in Syria, as it has been doing for years. Israel could retaliate with a series of similar, carefully calibrated, long-range missile strikes, targeting only those missile bases from which Iran launched last night's attack. That would still be seen by Iran as an escalation, since it would be a very direct attack by Israel on Iran itself, as opposed to hitting its proxy militias around the region. Or, Israel could choose to climb one more rung up the escalatory ladder, by broadening its possible response to include bases, training camps and command-and-control centres belonging to Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps - the IRGC. Either of the latter two options risk prompting further retaliation by Iran. The key question here is whether this all drags in the US, leading to a full-scale shooting war between Iran and US forces in the region. The US has military facilities in all six of the Gulf Arab states, as well as in Syria, Iraq and Jordan. These could all become targets for Iran's massive stockpile of ballistic and other missiles that it has managed to build up over the years, despite international sanctions. Iran could also do something it has long threatened to do if attacked: it could try to close the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz, using mines, drones and fast attack craft, choking off nearly a quarter of the world's oil supplies. This is the nightmare scenario, dragging in the US and the Gulf states into a region-wide war, which many governments are now working around the clock to avoid.",4 days ago,politics

248,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68799234,Israel-Gaza briefing: World watches nervously to see what Iran does next,"In the wars within wars of this grievous Gaza crisis, the most explosive of all is the searing official enmity between Israel and Iran. It's now at its most perilous point. And this region, and many capitals beyond, are watching and waiting with bated breath to see what Iran does next. It's Tehran's move after the airstrike on its diplomatic compound in the heart of the Syrian capital, Damascus on 1 April, which killed senior commanders in its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Israel never admits carrying out such attacks, but everyone knows it was its doing. And since the Israel-Gaza war erupted six months ago, Israel has ramped up its targeting of Iran, not just destroying arms supplies and infrastructure in Syria, but assassinating senior IRGC and Hezbollah commanders. ""We will make them regret this crime and other ones like it, by God's will,"" warned Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His vow triggered an immediate Israeli retort in an escalating war of words. The two regional powerhouses have been at daggers drawn ever since Iran's 1979 revolution made hostility towards the ""Zionist regime"" a core tenet of its doctrine. For many years, Israel has conducted targeted killings, mounted cyber operations, and sounded alarm bells about the Islamic Republic's nuclear ambitions as well as its backing for militias, including Hamas, who threaten Israel's destruction. ""If Iran attacks from its territory - Israel will respond and attack in Iran,"" declared Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in a post on X, formerly Twitter, tagging the Supreme Leader, a most modern of way to communicate for countries with no diplomatic ties. Then the United States - Israel's staunchest ally and Iran's most powerful adversary - weighed in, putting Iran on notice that it could also face the wrath of the world's mightiest army. ""We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,"" US President Joe Biden proclaimed, hinting that US intelligence was indicating an attack ""sooner rather than later"". ""The US could be trying to force Iran to recalculate and reconsider its options right now,"" reflects Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank. American media, quoting unnamed US sources, have spoken of possible maximalist scenarios involving a major Iranian assault against Israeli targets, with a wave of drones and missiles, including ballistic missiles. ""The US may be using this messaging to amp up anticipation, so if Iran can't deliver it, it shows its weakness, "" says Dr Vakil in a nod to the unsettling uncertainty of this moment. Iran, which has long prided itself on playing a long game, responding to any provocations with ""strategic patience"", now faces a choice of all choices. Every option is riddled with risk. Its ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has to give a green light to a counterattack which placates its militant IRGC commanders who shape Iran's foreign policy. He also has to preserve Iran's perceived prestige as the pivot of the ""Axis of resistance"" of its armed allies and proxies; they've been emboldened and empowered by their limited but still lethal attacks in this Gaza war. But this choice also has to be carefully calibrated to avoid sparking a dangerous escalatory spiral. If it pulls in formidable Israeli and American fighting power into this vortex, it could have catastrophic consequences for the Islamic Republic. The ailing 84-year-old Supreme Leader assumed his mantle in 1989, one year after the punishing Iran-Iraq war which took the lives of as many as 200,000 Iranians. It still casts a long dark shadow. ""Avoiding war is essential to his legacy,"" points out Iranian analyst Esfandyar Batmanghelidj. ""Whatever the retaliation against Israel, it will be designed to avoid a full-scale war."" But this moment is uncharted territory. The precise missile strikes earlier this month smashed the consulate annex next to Iran's embassy, and killed several IRGC officers including Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, its top general in the region in the Quds Force, the elite clandestine branch responsible for foreign operations. And it happened on Iran's diplomatic property, which Iran considers its own soil. For many years, Israel has waged what it calls the ""war between wars"" - strikes on arms shipments, installations, and routes in Syria said to be used by Iranian operatives and their allies, including their most prized and powerful proxy, Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. But in recent months it has upped the ante, exploiting opportunities for targeted assassinations during these turbocharged tensions of the Gaza war. Iran's response, so far, has been to mainly hit back through its proxies. The shadow wars stretch from hostilities along Israel's northern border with southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold, through Iran-affiliated militias in Iraq and Syria which have struck American targets, and Yemen's Houthi rebels now attacking shipping lanes in the Red Sea. In January, after a suspected Israel airstrike in Syria killed IRGC military advisors, Iran did respond directly. But it chose what were seen as ""soft targets"" less likely to provoke a major retaliation: ballistic missiles fired into northern Iraq against what was described as a base of Israel's Mossad spy agency; and missile and drone launches against Baloch separatists operating across its border in neighbouring Pakistan in another show of force to show its readiness to act. Both sparked outrage and, in Pakistan's case, a retaliatory airstrike from a traditional ally, but tensions soon eased. In the midst of this current crisis, minds in Iran as well as in Israel are concentrated not just on this risky tit-for-tat, but also on the more fundamental issue of deterrence. Both sides want to send the clearest of signals to the other that such consequential strikes would be costly, and best avoided in future. For Iran, under pressure at home from unprecedented protests spearheaded by women over restrictions on freedom, and financial hardships, preserving the Islamic Republic is paramount. But it also wants to safeguard its growing sway across the region, and the extensive political and military network its built over many decades. Its options range from direct raids on military targets in Israel, more distant operations against its embassies and interests somewhere in the world, or retaliating through its proxies again. A report by the well-connected Amwaj media cited the Occupied Golan Heights in northern Israel - land seized from Syria in the 1967 war - as a ""prime target"" and less risky choice. Israeli expert Raz Zimmt, Senior Researcher at the Institute for National Security in Tel Aviv, believes Iran will act forcefully. ""The patience of Iranians has run out in the face of setbacks blamed on Israel,"" he posted on X. Iran seized a commercial ship with links to Israel early on Saturday morning, but Mr Zimmt said Tehran is unlikely to consider this an ""appropriate response"", adding: ""It could afford it additional time to reconsider its next course of action."" But there's no agreement among Iran watchers about what action it will eventually take. And there's a risk too that what Iran views as a cautious calculated act, could be seen as, or end up as, an incendiary miscalculation. ""It does appear that Iran prefers to respond directly,"" Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group told the BBC. ""I don't think Iran wants to sacrifice Hezbollah or bring it into the fray. It is the top of its spear, and Iran wants to preserve it."" There is also the option of biding its time, at least for a while, to strike when its least expected rather than in the eye of this storm. ""There's an anticipation that Iran will respond, but doing nothing could be an option,"" says Dr Vakil of Chatham House. ""There is a choice on the table where Iran doesn't play into what could be an Israeli provocation."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under immense political pressure at home, has long argued for military action against Israel's arch-enemy, and is known to have been pulled back from the brink on at least one occasion. Behind the scenes, there's been an intense flurry of urgent messaging between the US and Iran, conveyed through third-parties including multiple Arab states, to avoid the all-out war nobody wants. Iran sees that, in itself, as burnishing its image as a regional heavyweight which matters. In this wait and watch moment, airlines have stopped flights, embassies have shut, or warned their citizens to leave Israel. The US has deployed its warships to strategic positions to reinforce its protection of American and Israeli troops, and it's strengthened its air defences to shield its forces deployed in Iraq and Syria. Israel, and countries across this region, are on high alert for something to happen somewhere.",5 days ago,politics
249,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68803939,West Bank: Palestinian man killed after Israeli boy goes missing,"A Palestinian man has been killed in the occupied West Bank and 25 are reported hurt after dozens of Jewish settlers stormed a village during an Israeli search for a missing teenager. Israeli troops intervened after dozens of settlers stormed al-Mughayyir armed with guns and stones. It is not yet clear whether the man who died, Jehad Abu Alia, 26, was shot by an armed settler or Israeli soldier. The Palestinian Red Crescent said live fire hit at least eight people. Missing Benjamin Ahimeir, 14, has not been found. A huge search is under way. Local media said the circumstances around the teenager's disappearance were still unknown and the military was not sure if the incident was terrorism-related. Troops have set up roadblocks in the area. Israeli media reported that Benjamin Achimeir had left ""Gal Farm"" in the settler outpost of Malachei Shalom early on Friday, and had not been seen since. He had been grazing sheep, and the sheep returned to the farm without him, police said. His sister Hannah, quoted by AFP news agency, said he was familiar with the area. Separately, Israeli forces shot and killed two West Bank Palestinians. One was confirmed by Hamas to be a local commander of the group. The Israeli military say Mohammed Daraghmeh was killed in a shoot-out with their troops. There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel on 7 October, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. At al-Mughayyir, videos posted on X by an Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din, show dark clouds of smoke billowing from burning cars next to an olive orchard, as gunshots are heard. Social media pictures also show what appears to be a crowd of masked settlers. The father of Jehad Abu Alia, the 26-year-old who was shot, spoke from a hospital in Ramallah, where Jehad's body had been taken. ""My son went with others to defend our land and honour, and this is what happened,"" Afif Abu Alia said. The IDF says its troops, and not settlers, opened fire at stone-throwing Palestinians as ""violent disturbances erupted at several points in the area"". Troops managed to remove the settlers who had entered the village, it said. ""As of this moment, the violent riots have been dispersed and there are no Israeli civilians present within the town,"" the IDF said. The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa, has condemned the attack. Foreign governments including Israel's closest ally, the US, have repeatedly raised concerns over a surge in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The international community considers the settlements illegal, though Israel disputes this. The Palestinian health ministry says at least 460 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since 7 October. Israeli sources say at least 13 Israelis have been killed there by Palestinians in the same period. The surge in West Bank violence has prompted the US, UK and France to impose sanctions on some settlers for the first time. But the casualties there are dwarfed by the Gaza war: more than 33,600 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's campaign, the Hamas-run health ministry says. On 7 October gunmen also took more than 250 people hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. The latest violence comes as Israel remains on high alert after US officials warned of an imminent Iranian strike against Israel . Iran has vowed to retaliate for last week's deadly air strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria, in which several senior Iranian military figures died. Israel has not commented but is widely considered to have carried out that attack targeting the elite Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.",5 days ago,politics

The judges said the entries ""document some of the most pressing issues facing the world today"" and serve as ""a reminder of the need for press freedom in all corners of the world"". The World Press Photo Contest recognises the best photojournalism and documentary photography. A Lost Place was selected by judges for being an ""innovative narrative on the climate crisis from a deeply personal angle"". The artist explained said the project conveyed her ""personal feelings of frustration and horror"" in response to the wildfires in Australia in 2019 and 2020. The photographer said: ""I watched the news of the fires from cold and grey London, terrified of the inevitable outcome. ""Many years earlier I had been trapped in a wildfire in the Hunter Valley region and still remember the intense heat and the sound of the roaring flames. ""Thoughts of this fire reverberated through my mind as I made this work."" For the first time, judges awarded two photos with a special mention.

251,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68796363,Joe Biden expects Iran to attack Israel 'sooner than later',"US President Joe Biden says he expects Iran to attack Israel ""sooner than later"", as fears grow of Iranian retaliation over an air strike that killed top commanders early this month. Israel has not admitted attacking an Iranian consulate in Syria but is widely believed to have been behind it. US officials have told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that a major attack on Israel could happen imminently. Israel says it is ready to defend itself. Mr Biden told Iran : ""Don't."" ""We are devoted to the defence of Israel. We will support Israel,"" Mr Biden said. ""We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed."" Iran backs Hamas, the Palestinian group fighting Israel in Gaza, as well as various proxy groups throughout the region, including some - such as Hezbollah in Lebanon - that frequently carry out strikes against the Israelis. On Friday, Hezbollah said it had launched ""dozens"" of rockets from Lebanon towards Israel. An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said around 40 missiles and two explosive drones had been launched. No casualties were reported and there were no indications of involvement from other actors. A US official told CBS the barrage was separate from any expected Iranian attack on Israel. BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says Iran is deliberately keeping the Middle East and Washington guessing. Ever since the lethal 1 April strike on the consulate building in Damascus, from which Israel believes Iran was directing its covert arms supplies to Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Syria, Iran's security establishment has been debating its response. This is all about calibration. Hit too hard and Israel will respond with devastating force. Go too lightly and Iran will risk being seen as weak and ineffective. From a tactical perspective, it makes no sense for Iran to respond right now, when the region is on full alert and when the US has been telling the world what to expect. Pragmatists in Tehran and Qom will be urging restraint, while hawks, including the ageing Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, will be demanding a firm response. But Iran does not want a full-scale war, nor do its neighbours on the Arab side of the Gulf. Governments there have already asked Iran for restraint. The question now, our correspondent says, is whether it is the hawks or the doves who prevail. The mounting tensions have led countries including the US, UK, India and Australia to warn against travel to Israel. Germany called on its citizens to leave Iran. The US state department also barred diplomatic staff and their families in Israel from travelling outside the cities of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beersheba. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met members of his war cabinet amid the warnings. Some Israelis said they were not worried about a potential Iranian attack. ""We know that we are surrounded by enemies, in the south, in the north, the east and the west,"" Daniel Kosman told AFP news agency at a market in Jerusalem. ""We are not afraid, I can promise you. Look around: people are going out."" The Israeli government has not issued any new advice to its people on top of existing guidance to stock up on water, food for three days and essential medicine. Israeli radio, however, reported local authorities had been told to prepare for the possibility of an attack, including by assessing the readiness of public shelters. Last week, the Israeli military cancelled home leave for combat troops, bolstered air defences and called up reservists. Thirteen people were killed in the 1 April missile strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. They included senior Iranian military leaders, among them Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of Iran's elite Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon. Israel has not commented but is widely considered to have carried out the attack. Officials in several countries have been trying to dissuade Iran from launching an attack, fearing it could spark a wider regional war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken to the foreign ministers of China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey in an attempt to convince them to use their influence with Iran. After meeting the commander of US Central Command on Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the bond between the two countries had been strengthened by the threat, adding ""we will know how to respond"". The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. More than 33,600 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's campaign in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The conflict has also seen Israel trade almost daily fire across its northern border with Hezbollah, while Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Yemen have attempted to hit Israeli territory as well as US bases in Iraq and Syria. Yemen's Houthi movement has also attacked shipping in the Red Sea, sinking at least one ship and prompting the US and UK to conduct air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.",5 days ago,politics
252,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68551965,Is Israel meeting promise to let more aid into Gaza?,"Israel says it is building a new land crossing into northern Gaza, where starvation is most acute, after previously promising to open the Erez crossing. The new crossing would handle up to 50 aid trucks a day and the first trucks have already crossed it, Israeli officials say. Israel has also said it will allow the Ashdod deep water port a short distance to the north to be used as well as allowing more aid from Jordan to enter via the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza. On Wednesday, 10 April, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke of gradually increasing Gaza aid deliveries to pre-war levels of 500 trucks a day. The number of trucks entering Gaza rose and then fell back over the course of the week, with just 147 trucks entering Gaza on Thursday. It follows the Israeli military's killing of seven aid workers on 1 April, which prompted the US to tell Israel to prevent civilian harm and humanitarian suffering if it wanted to maintain US support. Israel imposed a siege on Gaza after Hamas attacked nearby Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 to Gaza as hostages. It has hit Gaza with an aerial and ground campaign that has killed more than 33,000 people, mostly civilians according to the Hamas-run health authority. Israeli authorities have since allowed some aid in, but the UN and aid agencies say some children have died from malnutrition. On Wednesday USAID administrator Samantha Power said parts of Gaza were already under famine conditions. The number of trucks carrying food and other aid entering Gaza increased - but has since decreased again. On 8 April, 419 aid trucks went in, according to the Israeli authorities, including 330 trucks carrying food - more than double the average 140 food trucks a day in March. However, UN officials told the BBC the 8 April figure was in fact 223, less than half the daily number it says is required as a minimum to stem the crisis. UN officials have told the BBC that the discrepancy is because Israeli screening requirements mean trucks are often only half full. After border checks, goods are moved onto a new set of vetted trucks to travel on into Gaza, which are filled nearer to capacity. On Friday Cogat, the Israeli body that coordinates government activities in the occupied territories, said just 147 trucks containing aid entered Gaza, while 208 including just 112 containing food were distributed inside Gaza. They included an undisclosed number of food trucks that entered through the new border crossing to northern Gaza, which Israeli media reported was near the Zikim kibbutz, to the west of the Erez crossing. The Israeli military said the trucks had been accompanied by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. On Friday Philip Lazzarini, head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, said the increase in aid was ""not yet tangible, sustained or uninterrupted"". Humanitarian agencies, Israel's allies and other countries have accused Israel of not doing enough to ensure that food gets to those who need it. Some have accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. All aid for Gaza is subject to strict Israeli security checks aimed at preventing anything that could be used by Hamas from entering. But aid groups say these are complex and arbitrary, causing major delays. Israel has denied impeding the entry of aid to Gaza and accuses aid organisations of failing to distribute it. On Thursday Cogat said the content of hundreds of aid trucks was waiting to be picked up inside Gaza and said: ""UN, do your job. The bottlenecks are not on the Israeli side."" As conditions have deteriorated, the delivery of aid inside Gaza has also been accompanied by deadly violence. In one incident, the Israeli military killed seven aid workers working for World Central Kitchen (WCK), a charity that Israel was working with to distribute aid coming in by boat from Cyprus. Israel apologised and took action against the unit involved. There have been regular reports of shooting at Palestinians gathering to receive the little aid that has arrived in northern Gaza. The Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza and local Palestinians have accused Israeli forces of firing on desperate people. In the bloodiest incident, more than 100 people were killed on 29 February when a convoy arrived at al-Rashid street in Gaza City. Israel has denied involvement in the deaths, saying Palestinians have died in crushes, been run over by trucks and been shot by armed Palestinians, and that when Israeli troops have opened fire it has been at people they have deemed ""suspects"". Israel has banned UNRWA from delivering aid to northern Gaza over allegations it made that some UNRWA staff took part in the 7 October Hamas attack. Cogat said Israel would work with organisations that ""are not involved in terror"". The Crisis Group think tank has described Israel's approach to aid distribution as a ""fiasco"", accusing it of ""failing to coordinate military with humanitarian action"". It also said Israel was attempting to work around the international aid system and instead use aid convoys as a way of trying to build a network of players to administer Gaza after the war. ""It directs aid to big families who agree to embrace its agenda, while targeting those who refuse,"" the think tank said . The UN's most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, said in a BBC interview recently that Israel bore significant blame, and that there was a ""plausible"" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Mr Türk, who is the UN high commissioner for human rights, said that if intent was proven, that would amount to a war crime. Israel's Economy Minister Nir Barkat dismissed Mr Türk's warnings as ""total nonsense - a totally irresponsible thing to say"". Ashdod port, 32km (20 miles) north of Gaza, is one of Israel's three main cargo ports and can handle more than 1.5 million containers a year. However, there have been no reports of aid shipments for Gaza being received at Ashdod. On Wednesday Israel's Channel 12 reported that no preparations had been made to open Ashdod to humanitarian shipments. Because not enough aid has been getting into Gaza by land, countries have been trying alternative routes via the skies and sea - but these too have been beset by problems. Of the two schemes to get food and other aid into Gaza by sea, only one has begun operation and it has now been paused after the Israeli military attacked WCK, the aid agency that was unloading and distributing the aid from a jetty it had constructed from rubble. Last month, the first vessel to reach Gaza under the scheme arrived from Cyprus - the nearest EU country to Gaza - towing a barge carrying about 200 tonnes of food provided by WCK. By late March, WCK boss José Andrés said that 67 WCK kitchens were operating in Gaza, feeding 350,000 people a day. Meanwhile, a separate US military plan is in train, with a US navy ship on its way carrying materials to build a floating dock and pier , to enable supplies on far larger cargo ships to get ashore. According to the US defence department, it will mean two million meals a day could enter Gaza. But it is not expected to be ready for months. The US, Jordan, Egypt, France, the Netherlands and Belgium are among the countries to have dropped aid into Gaza, but aid groups say the technique is a last resort that can't on its own meet the need. At least 20 Palestinians are reported to have been killed during air drops - five when a parachute on an aid package failed to open and the crate fell on people waiting below, and the others when aid packages fell in the sea and desperate people drowned while trying to retrieve them. Air forces such as the UK's RAF normally drop aid at an altitude as low as 400ft (120m), but the Israelis have stipulated they must do so no lower than 2,000ft (610m). That means the parachutes have a long time to get blown off course by the wind and is why some airdrops in recent weeks have landed in the sea. A C-130 transport plane can carry 21 tons of aid - about the same quantity as can be carried by a single truck. There is also no way of organising the distribution on the ground. The first aid drop by the US on 3 March, carried out jointly with Jordan, contained enough food for more than 38,000 meals. On 11 April, US Central Command, or Centcom, said the US had dropped 855 tons of humanitarian assistance in total.",5 days ago,politics
253,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68796689,"'Huge amount' of Gaza surgery on children, says UK doctor","A British surgeon who recently returned from Gaza has told the BBC how she was struck by the high number of wounded children she operated on. Dr Victoria Rose said a ""huge amount"" of her work was on children under 16, including many under six. She said she had treated people with bullet wounds, burns and other injuries. She added the lack of food available in Gaza meant patients were not strong enough to heal properly. Over 76,000 Gazans - mainly civilians - have been injured by Israel over the course of the war, the Hamas-run health ministry says, while 33,000 people have been killed. The war was sparked by Hamas attacking Israeli communities near Gaza last October, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages to Gaza. Dr Rose, a consultant plastic surgeon, spent two weeks from late March at the European Gaza Hospital near Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The ""most shocking bit"" was that during the trip she only operated on one person who at 53 was older than her, she told the BBC's Today programme. ""Everybody else was younger than me. A huge amount of my work was under-16s. Quite a worrying proportion of my work was six and under."" Dr Rose was carrying out reconstructive surgery on people who had been wounded. ""It was burns, shrapnel injuries, removing foreign bodies from tissue, reconstructing defects in faces, removing bullets from jaws, that kind of thing,"" she said. The lack of food in Gaza - where the UN has warned of imminent famine - also meant many sick and injured people were not strong enough to fight off infection or heal properly from their wounds, she added. ""The people on my operating table were undernourished. A lot of them were cachectic,"" she said, referring to people experiencing extreme weight loss and muscle wasting. ""When we were looking at some of our patients who were not doing so well, there was a lot more infection than I've ever seen anywhere else. ""A lot of people's protein levels were in their boots, their haemoglobin levels were down. They are just not getting any nutrients, any vitamins or minerals."" Dr Graeme Groom, another doctor who was in Khan Younis, said the sound of bombing, tank fire and small arms fire was louder than during a previous wartime visit. At the time he and Dr Rose were working there, the Israeli military was still in Khan Younis. It pulled out most of its forces earlier this week. ""As [the bombing] became closer it was a very short time before we saw the effects of the bombing,"" he said. ""Just walking past the emergency department, for example, a pick up truck filled with distraught people backed up to the door with a pile of entwined corpses, followed by a line of cars with more bodies in the boots."" The European hospital - one of very few still operating in the territory - is also home to large numbers of displaced people, some of whom are camping out in hospital corridors. But those who have set up makeshift tents on nearby open ground were being forced to move by the need for space for fresh graves, Dr Groom said. ""Now there is a huge and spreading cemetery so that the graves of the newly dead are now displacing the shelters of the barely-living,"" he said. On Friday Rik Peeperkorn from the World Health Organization (WHO) said three other hospitals in Khan Younis - Nasser, al-Aqsa and al-Khair were completely non-functional after being the focus of fighting, while some basic services were being offered at al-Amal hospital despite ""immense structural destruction"". Nasser, the main hospital in southern Gaza, has been out of use since Israeli forces raided it in February . Gaza's biggest hospital, al-Shifa in Gaza City, was largely destroyed during a two-week Israeli military raid last month . Speaking after a visit to Khan Younis following the Israeli withdrawal, Mr Peeperkorn said the destruction in the city was ""disproportionate to anything one can imagine. No building or road is intact, there is only rubble and dirt"". Israel imposed a siege on Gaza after the Hamas attack, with severe limitations on the amounts of food, water and other necessities allowed to enter the strip. It has since allowed some aid to enter Gaza, but the UN says a number of children have died from malnutrition in northern Gaza, which has been cut off from most aid, and famine is imminent there. Israel has denied impeding the flow of aid into Gaza or within the territory. After the Israeli military killed seven aid workers earlier this month , it agreed to open up new routes and allow more aid in, including to northern Gaza. On Friday the Israeli military said the first food trucks had entered northern Gaza through a new crossing point. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel was meeting its commitment to open up additional vehicle crossings to Gaza for aid, but it was not enough and the US was continuing to press Israeli officials to do more.",6 days ago,politics

Iran has vowed to retaliate, blaming Israel for a strike on its consulate in Syria 11 days ago, killing 13 people. Two US officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that an attack could come as soon as Friday. One unnamed official said the attack could include more than 100 drones, dozens of cruise missiles and perhaps ballistic missiles as well and will be aimed at military targets in Israel. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the consulate attack on 1 April but is widely considered to have been behind it. Iran backs Hamas, the armed Palestinian group fighting Israel in Gaza, as well as various proxy groups throughout the region, including some - such as Hezbollah in Lebanon - that frequently carry out strikes against the Israelis. Those killed in the consulate attack included a senior commander of Iran's elite Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon, as well as other military figures. The attack came at a time of continuing diplomatic efforts to prevent the war in Gaza spreading across the region. Speaking on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden warned Iran was threatening to launch a ""significant attack"" and vowed to offer ""ironclad"" support to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government was ready to meet any security challenge, warning that Israel would harm any country that caused it harm. ""We are prepared to meet all of the security needs of the State of Israel, both defensively and offensively,"" he said. The commander responsible for US operations in the Middle East, Erik Kurilla, has travelled to Israel for talks with officials on security threats. The Pentagon said the visit had been scheduled previously but had been brought forward ""due to recent developments"". Following a call with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron urged against further escalation. Lord Cameron said he had ""made clear... that Iran must not draw the Middle East into a wider conflict"". ""I am deeply concerned about the potential for miscalculation leading to further violence,"" he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken to the foreign ministers of China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to argue that further escalation is not in anyone's interest. Following the call, China urged the US to play ""a constructive role"" in the Middle East, while also condemning the strike widely believed to have been carried out by Israel on Iran's consulate building in Damascus. It is not clear what form any reprisal attack would take nor whether it would come directly from Iran or via one of its proxies. On Sunday an Iranian official warned Israel's embassies were ""no longer safe"", suggesting a consulate building could be a possible target. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant has told his US counterpart that ""any direct Iranian attack"" on Israeli territory would ""require an appropriate Israeli response against Iran"". Asked about the travel restrictions on Thursday, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he would not disclose the ""specific assessments"" behind them, but added: ""Clearly we are monitoring the threat environment in the Middle East and specifically in Israel."" The UK Foreign Office has also updated its travel advice for Israel to state that the country's government has raised the ""possibility of an attack on Israeli territory from Iran, and that such an attack could trigger wider escalation"". Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October, the Foreign Office has warned against travel to large parts of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. France similarly warned its citizens to ""imperatively refrain from travel in the coming days to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories"".

Israel's military said the sons were members of Hamas's military wing - a claim denied by Haniyeh. The group was reportedly on its way to a family celebration to mark the first day of the Muslim holiday of Eid. Haniyeh told the broadcaster Al Jazeera that three sons - Hazem, Amir, and Muhammad - had remained in Gaza during the war. A statement from Hamas later said four of Haniyeh's grandchildren - Mona, Amal, Khaled and Razan - were among those killed in what they called the ""treacherous and cowardly"" strike. Haniyeh said he heard the news as he was visiting wounded Palestinians who had been taken for treatment to the Qatari capital, Doha, which is where the Hamas leader lives. ""The enemy will be delusional if it thinks that targeting my sons, at the climax of the [ceasefire] negotiations and before the movement sends its response, will push Hamas to change its position,"" he told Al Jazeera. In comments reported on Hamas's Telegram channel, he thanked God for the ""honour"" bestowed on him by what he called the ""martyrdom of his children and grandchildren"". Israel's military said it had ""eliminated three Hamas military wing operatives in the central Gaza Strip"", adding that they were the sons of Ismail Haniyeh. The statement did not mention the reported deaths of Haniyeh's grandchildren. Speaking to Reuters on Thursday, Haniyeh denied that his sons were Hamas fighters. As international pressure to reach a ceasefire deal grows, US President Joe Biden has sent the head of the CIA, William Burns, for the latest round of talks in Cairo. The latest proposal, which Hamas says it is analysing, reportedly includes the release of 40 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza in return for 900 Palestinians from Israeli jails. Haniyeh is widely considered Hamas's overall leader and has been a prominent member of the movement since 1980. He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017 and the US Department of State designated him a terrorist in 2018. These are not the first members of Haniyeh's family to have been killed in the war. Another son was reportedly killed in February, while his brother and nephew were killed in October, followed by a grandson in November. Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. More than 33,000 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza since the October attack, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",7 days ago,politics
256,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68788140,"Jeremy Bowen: Israel denies famine looms in Gaza, but evidence is overwhelming","The first time I crossed into Gaza through the Erez checkpoint in 1991 it was not much more than a few bored Israeli soldiers in a shed, checking IDs, before they let visitors drive their cars through an opening in the barbed wire and into Gaza. In the years since then, it evolved into a gleaming terminal, with complex layers of concrete walls, defences and steel gates, all covered with dozens of CCTV cameras. Only the very trusted and privileged were allowed to drive through Erez. Journalists had to walk and drag their bags with them. Until 7 October, when Hamas fighters smashed through Erez. They attacked the nearby military base, killing Israeli soldiers and taking others hostage. Since then, it has been closed to all but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As part of Israel's attempt to placate President Joe Biden after seven workers from the World Central Kitchen charity were killed by the IDF, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to reopen Erez to humanitarian convoys. That matters because it is the simplest way to get aid to perhaps 300,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza. The most authoritative measure of food emergencies, known as the IPC, has warned that famine will have gripped the area in the next four weeks or so. Joe Biden's humanitarian envoy to Gaza, David Satterfield, said on Wednesday that there was ""an imminent risk of famine for the majority, if not all, the 2.2 million population of Gaza"". The famine has been caused by the siege Israel imposed just after the 7 October attacks. At the time the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said: ""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. ""We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly."" Israel was forced by international pressure to allow in limited supplies of aid. But over six months it has not been anything like enough. Israel argued, inaccurately, that hunger in Gaza was caused by Hamas stealing and stockpiling aid and the UN's failure to distribute what was left. Close supporters of Prime Minister Netanyahu continue to deny there is a famine. One of them, an MP called Boaz Bismuth, told me at Israel's parliament that there was no famine in Gaza and allegations that Israel was starving civilians were based on antisemitism. The evidence of famine, however, is overwhelming. The Erez crossing, despite the prime minister's promise to Joe Biden, is still closed. I managed to get close enough to look down on the Erez terminal. Nothing was moving. I couldn't see people, let alone trucks. Reports in Israel say the government is talking about opening another crossing, less easily accessible to Israeli demonstrators who do not want any food or medical aid to enter Gaza while the hostages are still there and have been blocking some convoys. The UN and other aid providers say every day counts to try to help people caught up in the humanitarian catastrophe inside Gaza. The fact that Erez is closed looks like a delaying tactic. The Jewish ultranationalists whose backing keeps Mr Netanyahu in power also do not want to send in aid. The denial of famine fits seamlessly into the century of conflict between Arabs and Jews for possession of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. The conflict is sustained not just by years of Israeli occupation of land in Gaza and the West Bank including East Jerusalem that Palestinians want as a state, and the opposition of armed groups, notably Hamas, to Israel's existence. They also have opposing, wildly different national stories about their right to be there. The bitterness and bloodshed of the last six months have deepened the dehumanising differences between the two sides. I have spoken to many Palestinians and Israeli civilians in the last six months about their views of the war. It is hard to speak to Israeli soldiers, at least when they are in uniform. IDF spokespeople try hard to control the messages that reach journalists. But since much of Israel's fighting strength depends on mobilising reservists, it is much easier to talk to them when they are back in civilian life. In an unscientific attempt to get a feel for the beliefs and perceptions of Israeli soldiers after six months of war I went to Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in the town of Beersheba in southern Israel. It is only about 25 miles from Gaza. The rector of the university, Chaim Hames, told me that more than 100 members of their community - students, staff, faculty and their families - had been killed or taken hostage on 7 October. 6,500 students from a student body of 20,000 were mobilised. The war, Mr Hames said, was always close. ""The hospital is just across the road, the helicopters constantly ferrying the wounded from Gaza. Students are sitting in the classrooms. They hear the helicopters coming in and out, and many of them have friends who are still on active duty. It impacts everything."" I spoke to three young men who had spent months fighting in Gaza. They didn't want to use their full names. One of them, Ben, a 28-year-old postgraduate who serves in an engineering unit blowing up tunnels, had left only a few days before. He said the whole time he was in there it felt personal. ""I remember 7 October. I remember all my friends and the kibbutzim from the Gaza Strip. All my friends from the music festival… some are still hostages. The whole point was to make sure that it can never happen again and to replace Hamas as the ruling government. To make sure that our people are safe again."" ""It's extremely personal. From day one. I didn't wake up on a Saturday morning and hear about this from the news. I woke up and learned about it from group chats. From my phone, from people begging for help."" Oded, another 28-year-old who serves in a combat unit, agreed. ""I think everybody here is related somehow to what happened. Everybody. Everybody knows someone that was kidnapped. That was killed… It's not like a regular situation when it happens to a certain area. It's heavy. It's everywhere."" Ilan, a 25-year-old who serves in the reconnaissance unit of the paratroop brigade, detected sympathy and support for Hamas among civilians with whom he had come into contact. ""Of course, there are civilians that have nothing to do with it, but many of them are not that innocent… Many had photos of them holding an AK 47, photos of their children holding weapons. All the books, and pictures of Israel in flames."" ""I think many of them aren't innocent and they think it will be really hard to find those that are innocent. But it doesn't mean I think everyone should get hurt"". All three student soldiers agreed the war was necessary. ""We all wish for peace,"" said Oded. ""For quiet. Of course, I prefer to be here in the university to study, to go and drink my coffee instead of fighting a war like. It's not fun going to fight in a war, but sometimes it's necessary. And in this situation, it's necessary."" According to a poll conducted by Tel Aviv University's Peace Index three weeks after the 7 October attacks, most Israelis said they were now against the idea, revived by Joe Biden and other Western leaders, that the only way of ending this long conflict is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Ben said his thinking had changed because of the war. ""I think that if you would have asked me this question on 6 October, then I would say definitely yes, I would just do a Palestinian state. Let them live over there, and we'll live over here, and we'll all coexist, and everything will be nice. But after 7 October, it seems clear to me that that they don't want it as much as I wanted it."" Ilan agreed with him.  ""The idea of a state will never work until they show any acknowledgement of us having also a state of our own. I think the real cause of many of them, unfortunately, not to have two states to have one state, their own state, and us out of here. So of course, I want a good life for them also. But it starts from the education, the route. It will take a long time."" The Palestinian view of the war is entirely different. The idea that Israel is committing genocide alongside a whole range of other crimes of war in Gaza is universally accepted among them. As for education, schools and universities have been smashed by Israel in Gaza, as part of a scorched earth policy that has done vast damage. More than 2,000 academics affiliated with universities in North America have written an open letter condemning what they call ""scholasticide"" in Gaza. All 12 universities in Gaza have been destroyed and damaged. The letter condemns Israel for, among other actions, destroying the Islamic University by air strikes on 11 October and blowing up al-Isra University on 17 January, after using it as a barracks and detention centre. As well as the destruction of higher education, no children are going to primary or secondary schools. Ceasefire talks are going on in Cairo, mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatar. Prospects for success are poor. Both Israel and Hamas have entrenched positions and no inclination to budge. That is bad news for everyone, especially Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the surviving Israeli hostages.",7 days ago,politics

258,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68784260,'We are not fine': War casts shadow over Eid al-Fitr in Gaza,"""We miss the joyful atmosphere of Eid. We do not feel alive at all."" ""On Eid last year, we played, celebrated and rejoiced together,"" recalled Tala Abu Amr, a seven-year-old girl living in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. ""But this Eid, we miss the taste of happiness... There are no toys and no friends to play with. They're all dead."" Tala was one of a number of children who spoke to BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline radio programme about how they and other members of their families were struggling to celebrate the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, as the devastating war between Israel and Hamas continues for a seventh month. Eid al-Fitr is usually a period of great celebration for Muslims after a month of fasting, with families and friends coming together and sharing large meals. It is also common for children to receive either money or gifts from their elders. But this year, many families have been torn apart by the conflict, with more than 33,400 people killed in Gaza - the majority of them women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. An estimated 1.7 million people - half of them children - have also been forced to flee their homes and 1.1 million are facing catastrophic hunger, having exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities, the UN says. The war has cast such a pall over Gaza that ""We are not fine"" has become the official Eid al-Fitr greeting among residents and on social media platforms. On the eve of the festival, streets across the territory would usually be filled with the sounds of people chanting ""takbirs"", expressing their gratitude to God, while markets would be bustling with shoppers buying celebratory food, including sweets filled with dates and various types of chocolates. This year, however, the streets were filled only with pain and sadness. ""We used to stay up all night, purchase sweets and new clothes for the children, and pray at the Grand Mosque. Unfortunately, this year we are living in a tent without the basic necessities of life,"" Mohammed al-Barbari, a 47-year-old father of six from Gaza City who has fled to Rafah, told the BBC. Sarah Amer, an 11-year-old girl from Gaza City's Shejaiya neighbourhood, said she would usually go to the amusement park during the festival or be invited to parties by her aunts and cousins. ""This is a holiday of war. How can we rejoice and celebrate when there are people being killed, prisoners, and wounded?"" she asked. ""My friends... are missing now and I do not know where they are,"" she added. ""I miss those moments when I would meet and play with them, celebrate and chat and sing together."" ""I asked my mum to get us dolls to play with. My mum responded by saying: 'A lot of children like you lost their parents, they have nothing, they lost everything. Let's be considerate of them.'"" Khalil Abu Hassanein, a 13-year-old boy from the Sheikh Radwan area of Gaza City who is sheltering at a hospital north of Rafah, said: ""We used to celebrate Eid with our loved ones. But now all our loved ones have died and there are no new clothes to buy, no cookies to eat and no drinks to have."" ""This Eid has no taste because of the bodies of people... that we see."" Fedaa Murjan, who works for the independent Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, is unable to celebrate Eid al-Fitr because she is mourning her eight-year-old daughter, Habiba. She said Habiba was killed in an Israeli strike on their home in Gaza City on 13 October - only six days after the war was triggered by Hamas's attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. ""For Eid, we used to gather, we used to wear the best clothes we had. We used to have the best chocolate. They were days of happiness and joy for everybody in Gaza. But unfortunately, this Eid is very different from every other Eid before,"" she told the BBC from Rafah. ""This Eid, [I'm] not the Fedaa Murjan who used to be in every Eid. I'm a defeated, sad mother who has been suffering for six months because of the loss of my only daughter."" At al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Nidal Abdeh was filmed as he cradled the body of his young son, who he said had been killed in an Israeli air strike along with his wife and their two other children. ""Today is the first day of Eid. Our children have the right to have a happy life, a decent life,"" Nidal told Reuters news agency. ""[Israel's] planes, its barbarism and arrogance, killed our children."" The hospital's mortuary was also filled with the shrouded bodies of 14 people, who health officials said were killed in a strike on Nuseirat refugee camp. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. However, it put out a statement on Wednesday that said its forces were ""continuing to operate in the central Gaza Strip and killed a number of terrorists over the past day"". It added that aircraft had ""struck dozens of terror targets"" across Gaza. One way that many Palestinians in Gaza were able to mark Eid al-Fitr was to attend prayer services on Wednesday morning. In Rafah, where a million people are sheltering, dozens gathered on a street outside the ruins of al-Farouk mosque, which was destroyed in February. Meanwhile, Haroun al-Medallal told Gaza Lifeline that some of the women at his camp in the city had made cookies in an attempt ""to put a smile on the faces"" of the orphaned children there. ""Despite the pain, destruction, displacement and continuous shelling by the Israeli army, we are a life-loving people,"" he said. Mohammed Abu Amer said he was praying for a ceasefire, as Hamas considers a proposal from mediators in Cairo for a six-week pause in the fighting that would reportedly include the release of 40 of the hostages it is still holding. ""We hope that joy prevails during the days of Eid, the children rejoice, and this ordeal and war ends,"" he added. Several children in Rafah also said they were trying to stay positive. ""Despite the war and the fear, I am determined to enjoy Eid like other children in the world,"" said Nabeel Samy al-Saroura, 10. ""We will celebrate and rejoice.""",8 days ago,politics

This year's competition will take place in Sweden in May, amid calls for Israel to be banned over the war in Gaza. Several contestants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, have rejected calls for them to boycott the show. And it has been reported that Israel's Eden Golan has faced death threats. The 20-year-old has received several messages directly to her Instagram account, reported celebrity website Walla Celebs. The Jerusalem Post said the singer would arrive in Malmo, Sweden, with ""three times"" the usual number of security guards. In a statement, the European Broadcasting Union, which organises Eurovision, acknowledged ""the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision song contest - set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East - has provoked"". ""While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest,"" the statement continued. Jean Philip De Tender, deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union, added that the decision to allow Israel's participation was ""the sole responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies and not that of the individual artists"". ""We urge everyone to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue and support the artists who are working tirelessly - on what is a music and entertainment show - to share their music with the world,"" he added. Israel's public broadcaster, Kan, is a member of the EBU, giving it the right to participate in the contest. Organisers have resisted calls for it to be suspended, saying the show ""is not a contest between governments"". However, the EBU did force Israel to change the lyrics of Golan's song October Rain, after deciding the original was too political. The first version was widely considered to be a reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, with several lyrics paying tribute to the victims. Kan initially refused to change the song, saying it would prefer to withdraw from the contest - but Israel's President, Isaac Herzog, later called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure the country could participate. Now renamed Hurricane, the dramatic piano ballad is ninth favourite with bookmakers to win the competition. However, Israel's participation is unlikely to go unremarked when the contest takes place next month. Swedish police are preparing for multiple protests in Malmo in the week of the competition, and nine competitors have called for ""an immediate and lasting ceasefire"" in Gaza. The statement, signed by Olly Alexander, Ireland's Bambi Thug and Danish entrant Saba, among others, came in response to calls for musicians to boycott the show.

Singer Olly Alexander is representing the UK. Israel's participation has been criticised and the country had to revise its original entry, which breached political-neutrality rules. The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual televised song writing competition which is organised by The European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The 2024 contest features 37 performers chosen by EBU member broadcasters to represent their country. Songs must be original and no more than three minutes long. Lead vocals must be performed live, and a maximum of six singers and dancers can be on stage during the performance. Most Eurovision countries are European. But Australia takes part every year after being invited to send an act to the 2015 contest for Eurovision's 60th anniversary celebrations. However, Australia cannot host. If it ever won, it would have to nominate a European nation to stage the contest on its behalf. Other non-European countries including Israel are allowed to participate because they are members of the EBU. The 2024 contest is being held in Sweden after Loreen won in 2023 with her song Tattoo . She became the first woman to win the contest twice, after triumphing in 2012 with Euphoria. This is the third time Malmo has hosted Eurovision, and the seventh time the contest has been held in Sweden. As 2024 is the 50th anniversary of Swedish group Abba's first Eurovision win with Waterloo , there had been speculation about the band's potential involvement. But Abba members Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson told the BBC they would neither perform at the final, nor compose Sweden's entry . The grand final will be held in the Malmo Arena on Saturday 11 May. The semi-finals will take place on Tuesday 7 and Thursday 9 May. Both semi-finals and the grand final will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer . Pop star Olly Alexander is representing the UK at the 2024 contest , with his song Dizzy . The former Years and Years frontman is hoping to improve on the UK's disappointing performance in 2023, when Mae Muller came second to last. Alexander is well-known around Europe for hits including Desire, King and If You're Over Me. He is also a Bafta-nominated actor, having played the lead role in Channel 4's hard-hitting Aids drama It's A Sin. Israel's representative, Eden Golan, will sing a song called Hurricane - a rewritten version of the country's original entry, October Rain, which was thought to reference the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. The lyrics now tell the story of a woman experiencing a personal crisis, according to Israel's public broadcaster, Kan. Kan initially said it would withdraw from the contest rather than change the lyrics . But after the organisers barred the song for its political content, the country's President, Isaac Herzog, called for ""necessary adjustments"" to ensure Israel could compete . Separately, musicians and organisations from a number of participating countries have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza. Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"". Similar objections have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with many pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Alexander has rejected calls to pull out of the contest in protest against Israel's inclusion . Responding to an open letter from more than 450 LGBTQ artists, individuals and groups, he expressed his wish for peace but said he believed in the unifying power of music. Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different. The EBU has also said that abuse and harassment of artists over Israel's participation in the competition is ""unacceptable and totally unfair"". The semi-finals are decided entirely by a public vote from competing countries and people in the rest of the world. For the final, every country which qualifies awards two sets of scores: one from a jury of experts and one by fans. Each of their 10 favourite songs is given points - but they can't vote for their own country's song. Their favourite act receives 12 points, their second-favourite ten points, their third choice eight points, and then seven points, and so on, down to one point for their tenth favourite. Eurovision was one of the first televised competitions to let viewers vote. Fans in Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK began voting by phone in 1997. The rest of the world was allowed to vote in 2023, with points given to the 10 most popular songs worldwide. Each participating broadcaster pays an entrance fee to the EBU. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK pay the most, although the BBC does not make its contribution public. BBC News was told that other countries were asked to pay more after Russia's suspension. Three countries pulled out of the 2023 contest as a result. It is thought staging the 2023 event in Liverpool cost the BBC between £8m and £17m.

They said internal dissent in government was growing and called for tougher action on arms transfers. Israel said it would open new aid routes after President Biden threatened to reassess policy following Israeli strikes that killed seven workers from food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK), including a US citizen. But the tougher line was ""too little, too late"", said Annelle Sheline, an official working in human rights who quit the state department in protest a fortnight ago. She said the White House ""could have done this months ago and prevented famine in northern Gaza"". The US-Israel relationship is currently experiencing its most serious strain in decades, after President Biden's phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that amounted to a defining moment in the six-month conflict. Within hours of Mr Biden's call, Israel said it would open the Erez crossing in northern Gaza and the port of Ashdod in southern Israel to aid, and pledged to drastically improve security co-ordination with groups delivering assistance to Palestinians. In a newly-aired interview, Mr Biden said he believed the Israeli prime minister was making ""a mistake"" in his handling of Gaza. The US president spoke to Univision two days after the Israeli strike on WCK workers - and before Israel announced the opening of the Erez crossing - though the footage was only aired on Tuesday, In the interview, Mr Biden said the US ally should ""just call for a ceasefire"" with Hamas, and allow ""total access to all food and medicine"" for Gaza. Despite the steps taken by Mr Netanyahu last week, the views of seven current and former US government officials reflect the way internal objections to policy continue to mount. They said many government workers were voicing their frustrations in unofficial forums that include at least a dozen groups on messaging apps, which the officials said counted hundreds of administration staff as members. A spokesperson for the US state department said it encouraged different views on policy and staff could make them known through ""appropriate channels"". The US had ""been clear at the highest levels publicly and privately with Israel that it must abide by international humanitarian law"", the spokesperson said. Four current officials at varying levels of seniority in different government departments spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity. Two have roles in areas with direct links to foreign policy, including on Israel and Gaza. One who has 25 years of national security experience said internal opposition had become ""deeper, wider and more despairing"" than at any previous point in the war. While the increase in pressure from President Biden last week was welcome, it did not go far enough to reflect the ""moral urgency"" to act, they said. ""I read it as Israel doing the bare minimum to get through the day and avoid arms transfers being halted,"" the official added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday more than 400 trucks had been cleared to go into Gaza the previous day, describing ""important commitments"" made by Israel. However, UN officials told the BBC the figure was in fact 223, less than half the daily number it says is required as a minimum to stem the crisis. Some of the officials who spoke to the BBC said they wanted the Biden administration to explicitly condition arms supplies to Israel in order to avoid a full-scale humanitarian collapse. The administration has been under increasing pressure to say whether it is conducting a full review by the state department's Office of the Legal Advisor into whether Israeli actions in Gaza have breached international law, which could lead to a bar on US weapons shipments. Josh Paul, a former senior official who resigned last year in protest, said the state department had not asked the office to make an assessment because ""it does not want the answer it will get"". The state department declined to confirm whether it had referred any cases to the office. The officials' concerns echoed those of dozens of Democrats in Congress, including Biden ally and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who signed a letter on Friday urging the US to pause weapons' transfers to Israel in the wake of the 1 April strikes on the WCK aid convoy, which sparked international outrage. The Israeli military called the attack a ""grave accident"". Israel has consistently denied violating international law in Gaza, blaming thousands of civilian deaths from its offensive on Hamas for operating from civilian areas. It says it has fought a threat to Israel's existence after the attacks by Hamas on 7 October, in which some 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 were taken hostage back to Gaza. The three former officials the BBC spoke to include Ms Sheline and Mr Paul, who both quit in protest, and Brian Finucane, a lawyer who spent a decade at the state department advising on laws of war and arms transfers. There has been ongoing dissent within the US government about Gaza policy since the first months of the war. And in February, hundreds of civil servants in the US and European countries warned that their governments risked being complicit in ""grave violations of international law"" in a letter initially obtained by the BBC. At the time, Robert Ford, a former US ambassador, said that unlike during the lead-up to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, when many officials had reservations but did not speak up, the seriousness of Gaza war had pushed career civil servants to publicly air their concerns. A second serving US official who spoke to the BBC anonymously described ongoing exchanges in at least a dozen chat groups on messaging apps Signal and WhatsApp. In these, staff vented exasperation and incredulity at the way they perceived the Biden administration too easily accepted Israeli versions of events. ""There's a lot of eye rolling... People can point out the inconsistencies and the fallacies pretty quickly,"" said the official. The World Central Kitchen aid workers killed on 1 April had been transporting food aid delivered by sea into Gaza while Israeli-controlled land routes remained tightly restricted. A ""foolish"" system of deliveries by sea, as well as plans for a US-built floating pier to get aid in Gaza, were both designed ""as a workaround for the fact that we [did] not pressure the Israelis to let aid in other ways"", said the official who has spent more than two decades working in US national security. After Israel's announcement on aid routes on Thursday, Mr Blinken said Washington would judge the move by ""results"" in protecting civilians. Israel has previously blamed the United Nations for aid delivery failures - a claim categorically rejected by the UN and humanitarian groups - and has said Hamas steals supplies. A third government official said the fact that much more concerted US pressure was applied only after the deaths of international aid workers sent a message that ""Palestinian lives do not matter"". Nearly 200 Palestinian aid workers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to Humanitarian Outcomes, a group that monitors aid-worker deaths. The officials' accounts are the latest sign of deepening disquiet and a growing readiness within the ranks of the Biden administration to question the moral and legal basis of US backing for Israel, a bedrock of Washington policy going back decades across administrations. Some criticised the support as apparently unconditional, citing Washington's $3.8bn (£3bn) a year package of military assistance to Israel and the potential sale of $18bn worth of F-15 fighter jets . The supply of arms has continued uninterrupted despite the number of people killed in Gaza now standing at more than 33,000, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry, which are accepted by the US government. In a recent statement, the Israeli military said it had killed about 13,000 Hamas fighters since the start of the war, although it did not say how it calculated that figure. It has consistently denied killing large numbers of civilians, either deliberately or through negligence. But accusations of reckless targeting have continued to grow, leading to calls in the US for an assessment over whether Israel's military campaign was in breach of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the targeting of non-combatants. State department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that the US had ""not at this time concluded that Israel has violated international humanitarian law"" but said its assessments were ""very much ongoing"". But referring to the assessments, Mr Finucane, the former state department lawyer, told the BBC: ""I think they're likely dramatically overstating the reality."" He described a new process the department launched in September to monitor any civilian harm by partner military forces as essentially ""guidance"" with ""no structure behind it"". Since the dissent letter by officials in February, US policy has still lacked ""course correction despite its manifest failures"", according to Mr Finucane, who is now a senior advisor at the International Crisis Group. Responding to the criticism, the state department spokesman said that Mr Blinken ""takes all feedback and opinion seriously, and it causes him to reflect on his own thinking in terms of policymaking"".",10 April 2024,politics
264,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68774205,Can US pressure deliver Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza?,"A truce between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza was never going to be easy. Weeks of talks have failed to produce agreement. But international pressure is growing. Perhaps the biggest sign is the Biden administration sending William Burns, the head of the CIA, for the latest round of talks in Cairo. Hamas has, in public at least, stuck with its initial demands of a permanent ceasefire, the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return of displaced Palestinians to northern parts of the territory without restrictions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile insists that Israel will continue fighting until Hamas is destroyed and hostages the group is holding are free. ""There's a lot more American pressure on Israel, and on Egypt and Qatar to put pressure on Hamas. That's obvious,"" said Gershon Baskin, who helped negotiate a deal with Hamas for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. ""The fact that the head of the CIA showed up, which required all the negotiators to be there at the highest level. That's indicative of increased American pressure."" But that does not mean a deal is at hand. Israeli officials have indicated willingness to make some concessions amid intensifying frustration among the country's main allies, including the US. Earlier this week, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, suggested that now was the right time for a truce. Any deal is expected to see the release of some of the hostages captured in the Hamas attacks in return for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails, which was the basis for a truce that led to a temporary pause in hostilities in November. According to Israeli authorities, 133 people remain captive in Gaza, although at least 30 have already been confirmed dead. Under the latest US proposal, an initial phase of a six-week ceasefire would see Hamas release 40 hostages who are alive, with the priority being given to female captives including soldiers, men over the age of 50 and those with serious medical conditions. Israel would then release at least 700 Palestinians, including about 100 who are serving life sentences for killing Israelis, which has proved controversial in Israel in the past. But Hamas has reportedly told negotiators it is not holding 40 people in this category, raising the prospect that many more hostages than previously thought have died or that they could be in the hands of other armed groups, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In Israel, Mr Netanyahu's room for manoeuvre is limited by pressure from different parts of society and politics. While most of the Israeli public remain supportive of the war, there are growing calls for him to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages. The families have held large protests, accusing the prime minister of not making the captives' return a priority and of being more concerned with his own political survival. Calls for Mr Netanyahu to resign are on the rise too. Divisions have intensified within Mr Netanyahu's governing coalition, which includes far-right, ultranationalist allies who refuse concessions to Hamas and insist the war must go on. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told the prime minister that increasing pressure on Hamas was the only way to bring the hostages back and destroy the group, while National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir explicitly threatened to bring down Mr Netanyahu himself if he did not go ahead with a much-promised offensive into the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza. Israeli officials insist it is essential to enter Rafah, where, they say, Hamas has four operational brigades and its senior leaders could be hiding. But virtually everyone outside Israel is against an offensive in the city, where about 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering in tents, improvised shelters and overcrowded camps, over concerns of the catastrophic impact it could have on civilians. In what could have been an attempt to counter domestic criticism, on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said a date had already been set for a Rafah operation, without giving details. ""There's a revolt going on right now in the government, and within [Mr Netanyahu's party] Likud, against Netanyahu making any kind of deal that they don't think should be made,"" Mr Baskin said. ""Netanyahu is not a free actor. He's a hostage himself within his own government."" For its part Hamas has yet to give a formal response to the latest proposal, but said that while it was interested in an agreement ""that puts an end to the aggression on our people"", the offer did not meet its demands. ""The Israeli position remains intransigent,"" the group said in a statement. The White House described the group's response as ""less than encouraging"". A final decision will probably be made by Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza who is thought to be hiding in tunnels surrounded by guards and hostages. But communications with him are difficult and said to involve several intermediaries and take days. The group, Mr Baskin said, was also demanding more say in which Palestinian prisoners would be released and that it would not agree to any of them being deported to another country, issues that could present obstacles to negotiations. Hamas also believes that without guarantees of a permanent ceasefire, Israel will continue to attack the group once the hostages are released. Its leadership has witnessed growing international criticism of Israel and may believe time is on their side to secure concessions, despite the overwhelming and immediate needs of Gaza's devastated civilian population. The war in Gaza, Israel's response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October that killed about 1,200 people, has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, destroyed large parts of the territory, and left many on the brink of famine. ""From my experience in dealing with these things, the main difficulties are whether or not the main decision maker on both sides is ready for a deal. That's not clear,"" Mr Baskin said. ""It's not clear that Netanyahu is ready for a deal, it's not clear that [Hamas political leader in Gaza Yahya] Sinwar is ready for a deal. But when they are, they will find the middle ground."" Perhaps unsurprisingly, a Hamas spokesperson seized on Mr Netanyahu's comments about setting a date for an attack on Rafah, saying it raised questions about the purpose of resuming negotiations.",9 April 2024,politics
265,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68774923,RAF takes part in largest airdrop of aid to Gaza,"It is all over in seconds. The aircraft slows, lifts its nose and 12, perfectly wrapped pallets of humanitarian assistance slide off the open ramp at the back. One minute ago, 10 tonnes of food and water was there, the next it was floating gently by parachute in the southwesterly breeze, touching down on the northern shores of Gaza. It seems so simple and straightforward. Yet the delivery of aid by air is anything but simple. And it is far from uncontroversial. This was the largest coalition airdrop of the war: 14 aircraft from nine nations delivering aid. The scale of the delivery was timed to mark the end of Ramadan. At a military airbase to the east of Amman, the capital of Jordan, we watched as aircrew from the UK, the US, the Netherlands, Germany, Egypt, Indonesia, UAE and France were briefed by their Jordanian counterparts. They need to know who is doing what and where, the airspace over Gaza is small. Each country has its own drop zone, its own way of delivering aid. The whole operation is organised by the Jordanians but everything has to be signed off by the Israelis. If the IDF says no, then the planes do not take off. The Turks were planning to join the coalition today but were vetoed at the last minute. The aid is stacked in vast open hangars: piles of flour, sugar, rice, beans, pulses, oil, and water. The UK has its own corner where British servicemen and women - both from the RAF and the 47 Air Despatch squadron of the Royal Logistics Corps - carefully pack their own pallets. Everything is carefully weighed - each bundle cannot be too light or too heavy. Everything is packed deliberately to avoid damage on impact. Ropes and straps are measured precisely into place. Few gifts have been so carefully wrapped. The whole thing sits atop a thick slab of plywood. Fork-lift trucks load the pallets on to A400M, one of the RAF's biggest transport planes - the successor to the much-missed Hercules C130s. Each container slides along a rolling track on the deck of the plane. Repeated checks are made to ensure they will not jam. We take off and 40 minutes later we are over the drop zone. And here is the next complication. The RAF normally drops aid as low as 400ft, but the Israelis have stipulated they must do so no lower than 2,000ft. That means the parachutes have a long time to get blown off course by the wind. That is why some airdrops in recent weeks have landed in the sea. On our flight the pilots warned us they would drop the containers over the sea, but the southwesterly breeze would drift them back inshore. Which is exactly what happens. Job done and we return home. So none of this easy. The potential for error is huge. It is also not a very good way of delivering aid. The RAF flight was carrying about 10 tonnes of aid. That is less than a single truck can carry across a border on the ground. So there is huge effort and expense, but marginal impact. The British military know this. But squadron leader Lucy Playle, the detachment commander in Amman, said the cumulative impact was beginning to tell, with around 1,500 tonnes of aid delivered in the past month. ""This is a sustained effort,"" she said. ""We've been here for three weeks now, and we are continually delivering aid. ""The people of Gaza are very grateful for the efforts that we are going to. And we will keep delivering and delivering, until we can't give them any more."" Some international aid charities say these flights are for show - to present an illusion that some countries are contributing to the humanitarian effort. They say the airdrops are a symbol of the failure to get aid in by other means, a distraction from that effort. They argue, correctly, that the airdrops will simply not meet the need on the ground. There are also risks. There is no way of organising the distribution on the ground. Some Gazans have been crushed stampeding for the pallets. Others have drowned trying to grab those landing in the sea. Some were even injured when containers dropped on buildings. But the aircrews here in Jordan insist they are making a difference, that they are filling a gap - not least while there is simply not enough aid getting through by road or sea. Warrant Officer Adrian Dibbs said: ""It's not that much - but it is the effort that counts, as in every little helps. I am quite proud and privileged to be involved in this sort of a mission.""",9 April 2024,politics

Ozain Yousef, 23, shared extremist material supportive of the group following its attack on Israel on 7 October, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Yousef, of Mexborough Place, Leeds, admitted a charge of supporting a proscribed organisation last month. He was sentenced to 16 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for two years. The court heard Yousef was arrested on 24 November last year as part of an investigation by Counter Terrorism Policing North East. It followed a report made to police that his social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter, had posted extremist material supportive of Hamas His lawyer said he had been ""caught up in the toxic environment of social media"" and was ""very ashamed of where that led him"". Judge Daniel Sternberg said Yousef had ""plainly engaged in persistent conduct"" intended to show support for Hamas.' One post directly acknowledged Hamas and aligned himself as a ""brother"" of the proscribed organisation, the court heard. In another, he re-posted an image of a sniper from the Qassam Brigade, the military wing associated with Hamas. Judge Sternberg said it was important that Yousef had expressed regret for his actions to the probation service. He added: ""You expressed embarrassment for bringing shame to your family through this incident."" Defence lawyer Kara Frith told the court Yousef was ""adamant"" he did not believe everything he posted and was ""truly remorseful"". Yousef was ordered to pay £85 in costs and a victim surcharge of £154, as well as to complete 100 hours of unpaid work.

267,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68766913,Gaza: Benjamin Netanyahu sets date for Rafah offensive as pressure grows,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has set a date for a military offensive into Rafah, despite growing warnings that it could lead to high civilian casualties. More than a million Palestinians are sheltering in the southern city after being forced to flee their homes. Mr Netanyahu's comment followed calls by far-right government allies to step up military actions against Hamas. The prime minister's popularity has plummeted after six months of war. With negotiations with Hamas still under way in Egypt, Mr Netanyahu is being pushed to agree a hostage-prisoner swap and ceasefire deal by many Israelis - as well as key international allies, including the US. But as discontent grows at home and abroad over how his government has conducted the war, he is also facing calls to ramp up operations against Hamas by far-right leaders he has relied on for political support. Mr Netanyahu's rule is backed by a coalition that includes far-right, ultranationalist parties, some of whom are against the idea of making concessions to Hamas. They say the war must continue and believe the Israeli military should go ahead with plans to launch an incursion into the southern city of Rafah, where about 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering in tents and overcrowded camps. Those calls intensified after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it was pulling its troops out of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, effectively ending major ground operations in the area. Itamar Ben Gvir, the far-right national security minister, warned Mr Netanyahu that if he ""decides to end the war without a broad attack on Rafah to defeat Hamas, he won't have a mandate to continue serving as prime minister"". Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich told the prime minister ""we have to increase the pressure on Hamas in Gaza, which is the only way to bring back the [Israeli] hostages and destroy Hamas"". Speaking on Monday after those interventions, Mr Netanyahu said: ""Today I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo - we are constantly working to achieve our goals, first and foremost the release of all our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas. ""This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen - there is a date."" The remarks may be seen as an attempt to appeal to allies that sustain his coalition, as any offensive is unlikely to be imminent. Mr Netanyahu did not indicate which date he had decided on. The US is opposed to an assault on Rafah, and the Israeli government has also been urged to halt the planned offensive in a joint statement signed by Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, French President Emmanuel Macron and Jordan's King Abdullah II. Writing in France's Le Monde newspaper, they warned the plan would have ""dangerous consequences"" and ""threaten regional escalation"", adding: ""The war in Gaza and the catastrophic humanitarian suffering it is causing must end now. They also said a recent UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all Hamas-held hostages must be ""fully implemented without further delay"". Domestically, there have been large protests demanding an agreement to guarantee the release of the hostages. Families say Mr Netanyahu has not made their release a priority, and that the government's strategy of putting military pressure on Hamas to negotiate has failed. The relatives say time is running out to save the captives who remain alive. With talks involving intermediaries in Cairo ongoing, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant suggested earlier this week that now was the right time for a deal over hostages. On Monday, a senior Hamas official told the Reuters news agency that Israeli proposals had not met its demands, but the group said they would nevertheless be examined. ""There is no change in the position of the occupation [Israel] and therefore, there is nothing new in the Cairo talks,"" the Hamas official, who asked not to be identified, said. ""There is no progress yet."" William Burns, the director of the CIA, is attending the Cairo talks. His presence underlines the growing pressure from the US - Israel's main ally - for an agreement. In a separate development, Israel reported that 419 aid trucks had entered Gaza on Monday, including 330 trucks carrying food - more than double the average 140 food trucks a day in March. It follows US pressure on Israel to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Gaza. On Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a Senate hearing that widespread famine in Gaza would ""accelerate violence, and it will have the effect of ensuring that there's a long-term conflict"". ""It doesn't have to happen,"" he said, adding: ""We should continue to do everything we can, and we are doing this, to encourage the Israelis to provide humanitarian assistance."" However, an Israeli promise to open the Erez crossing to northern Gaza, where hunger is most acute, has not yet been carried out and officials have not indicated when that could happen. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, again warned of possible famine, saying far too little aid was reaching Gaza. Philippe Lazzarini also warned Palestinians returning to the devastated city of Khan Younis about the threat of unexploded munitions there following the Israeli pullout. He told the BBC there might be thousands of such devices in the rubble. Some residents who have already gone back said they were unable to locate their homes in the ruins. Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. More than 33,000 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Gaza is said to be on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day. Israel has denied impeding the entry of aid or its distribution inside Gaza, and has accused UN agencies on the ground of failing to get the aid that is allowed in to the people who need it.",9 April 2024,politics
268,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68768948,Israel's Gaza withdrawal hints at what comes next,"The Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza announced on Sunday was greeted with widespread surprise, even as the Israeli army and government have been at pains to stress that it has no great significance. But to a world that has watched the intensity of Israel's bombardment, the idea that there was now just one brigade left in the entire enclave seemed to signify some major shift in the war. And then there was the timing of the announcement - on the very day that marked the grim milestone of six months since the Hamas-led assault on Israel ignited this latest and bloodiest phase in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. ""Don't read too much into it,"" a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister's office told journalists the next day. Avi Hyman stressed how small the distances involved are and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would therefore continue to be able to take whatever action it deemed necessary, with or without troops stationed inside Gaza. As if to prove the point - just hours later, the Israeli army said it ""eliminated"" a senior Hamas operative, Hatem al-Ghamri, in an air strike. The Israeli media has, however, responded very differently. In the widely read and right-wing Israel Hayom, the paper's diplomatic correspondent Ariel Kahana tied the troop withdrawal to pressure on the Israeli government to agree a ceasefire deal with Hamas in the latest round of talks. ""The formal reasons offered by Israeli spokespersons for halting the war were operational in nature, but every intelligent person can see that the timing is hardly coincidental. Ahead of critical talks, the Israeli capitulation was designed - without saying so explicitly - to signal to Hamas that Israel was being very forthcoming with it from its perspective."" Ben Caspit in the more centrist Maariv newspaper was even more forceful in his interpretation of the move. ""If you were to ask Netanyahu (and he was asked), this was done to prepare for the promised operation in Rafah… There is a second explanation, one that has been reported all over the world in every possible language. By that account, the 98th Division's withdrawal from Khan Yunis is linked to talks for a hostage deal. ""Serious media outlets around the world have reported that the conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu was dramatic. Biden led Netanyahu to understand that he wasn't a pace away from victory, but a pace away from the final destruction of the alliance between Israel and the United States."" In public at least, Mr Netanyahu has continued to ratchet up the rhetoric on Rafah, saying that a date has been set for the operation. His defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has been more nuanced, telling army recruits that now is an ""opportune"" time to do a deal with Hamas. But he stressed that a ceasefire would not be the end of the war: ""There will be difficult decisions and we will be ready to pay the price in order to get the hostages back, and then return to fighting."" The fighting is likely to continue, as Mr Gallant says, but the form it takes may change substantially.  With criticism of the way the war has been conducted growing from Israel's most powerful ally, the US, the drawing down of forces in Gaza seems likely in part to be aimed at showing the Biden administration that Israel is listening to its concerns over civilian casualties and life-threatening aid shortages. An end to bombardments that have reduced cities to rubble, as has been seen in the latest images from Khan Younis, may go some way to restoring the customary whole-hearted support for Israel from Washington. But that will undoubtedly be tested again, if the ""future operations"" that the Israeli army says troops are being given rest and recuperation to prepare for means a full-scale assault on Rafah where Israel believes Hamas's remaining military forces are now based, among more than a million displaced Palestinians. There may be a belief in the Israeli government and military that a significant number of that population, squeezed into barely functioning shelters, may start moving back to their homes now that the bulk of Israeli troops is gone. But what Palestinians have found on their return to Khan Younis is mass devastation, with many of their homes reduced to rubble. They have described how Gaza's second city is now unliveable, not even fit for animals, as some have put it. Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, warned Palestinians thinking of heading to Khan Younis about the threat of unexploded munitions there following the Israeli pullout. Philippe Lazzarini told the BBC there might be thousands of the devices in the rubble. So a major exodus from Rafah, which would make any Israeli operation against Hamas less likely to cause a new catastrophic toll of civilian casualties, may not be on the cards. But the ""further operations"" may also relate to the conflict on Israel's northern front with Hezbollah in Lebanon. That confrontation has been steadily escalating since 7 October. And there are fears that it could become far more intense, following the suspected Israeli strike in Damascus that killed several senior commanders in Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards last week. Hezbollah is closely allied to Iran and has matched the rhetoric coming from Tehran, vowing revenge. The Israeli army has recently said that it has substantially strengthened its Northern Command. So, this too may have played a part in the troop withdrawal from Gaza. Whatever the true motives were - and they are likely to have involved a number of interlocking factors - it is unlikely that Israel's military engagement in Gaza is anywhere close to coming to an end, with Hamas fighters already having shown their capacity to regroup in areas that had been subjected to the heaviest onslaught from the IDF.",9 April 2024,politics
269,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68769623,Germany says 'history' drives Israel aid in ICJ case,"Germany has said Israel's security is at the ""core"" of its foreign policy, as it defends a genocide case brought against it at the UN's highest court. Nicaragua had accused it of breaching the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel and ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency. Berlin rejected the claims at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague on Tuesday. In 2023 some 30% of Israel's military equipment purchases came from Germany. The purchases totalled €300m ($326m; £257m). The allegations build on a separate case taken by South Africa in January, where judges in the Hague ordered Israel to take ""every possible measure"" to avoid genocidal acts. Israel rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself. More than 33,000 have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians. Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day. Nicaragua says Germany's arms sales to Israel, which totalled $326.5m last year - a tenfold increase on 2022 - make it complicit in Israel's alleged war crimes. The Central American country had brought the case to the Hague to ask judges to issue emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance. Firmly rejecting the accusations, Germany's representative argued on Tuesday that Nicaragua's case - which she said was rushed and based on the ""flimsiest of evidence"" - was aimed more toward Israel. ""Nicaragua insists [on] initiating proceedings against Germany before this court, [and] has taken a one-sided view of the conflict. It fails to properly appreciate both the facts and the law in this situation"", lawyer Tania von Uslar-Gleichen said on Tuesday. ""Our history is the reason why Israel's security has been at the core of Germany's foreign policy,"" she told the court. ""Where Germany has provided support to Israel, including in a form of export of arms and other military equipment, the quality and purposes of these supplies have been grossly distorted by Nicaragua."" In her opening statement, she argued that Germany was doing its ""utmost to live up to its responsibility"" to both Palestinians and Israelis. Germany had a duty to remind Israel of the rules of international humanitarian law, even as it exercised its ""right to self defence"", she added. On the issue of ceasing its funding of the UN's aid agency, she argued that Germany was among the largest international donors to Gaza in 2024. Another lawyer representing Germany, Christian Tams, said that Germany had resumed funding operations of the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), a fact ""ignored by Nicaragua"". Germany was one of 15 Western nations which suspended funding for UNRWA over allegations that some of the agency's staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel. According to papers filed with the ICJ, Nicaragua wanted the UN's top court to resume funding of the aid agency, one of the few international bodies still operating in Gaza. On Monday, the opening day of the trial, Nicaragua's lawyers had said Berlin was ""pathetic"" for supplying Israel with arms while at the same time giving humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Alain Pellet, a lawyer for Nicaragua, said it was ""urgent that Germany suspend continued sales. ""Germany was and is fully conscious of the risk that the arms it has furnished and continues to furnish to Israel"" could be used to commit genocide, he told judges. Nicaragua's case has raised broader questions about the accountability of countries supplying weapons to Israel since the Gaza conflict began. Michael Becker, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, told the BBC on Monday that there was uncertainty about states' obligations to prevent genocide or ensure respect for humanitarian law. The case against Germany, he said, could potentially help clarify the issue. ""Under international law, states can also be held responsible for aiding or assisting in another state's violations of international law,"" he observed. ""But international law on aid or assistance in the commission of an unlawful act is full of uncertainty. For example, it may not be clear whether Nicaragua needs to demonstrate both that Germany knew its assistance to Israel risked contributing to violations of international law but that that Germany intended that result. Critics of Nicaragua's case have highlighted the country's chequered human rights record. The government of President Daniel Ortega has jailed opponents and banned protests. In March, the UK's mission to the UN accused the government of a ""relentless"" crackdown on human rights.",9 April 2024,politics
270,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpek3pekk7vo,Gender-specific aid sent to women in Gaza,"An all-female group of charity volunteers from Birmingham have sent gender-specific products to women in Gaza to help those in the region. The eight women spent last week in a warehouse in Egypt packing and loading about 3,000 hygiene kits on to a lorry, which is due to be driven across the Rafah border into Gaza. Each kit includes five packets of sanitary towels, two tubes of toothpaste, a toothbrush, body lotion, hand sanitiser, packets of wet wipes and shampoo. The eight women have been working with the charity ISRA-UK. Saraya Hussain, from Birmingham, who led the project, said handwritten messages of ""love, peace and hope"" were included. Seeing the lorry ready to go was emotional for many of the volunteers, she said. ""One of the team described it as bittersweet, in that she felt proud that she was able to do something but it equally felt like it was so little. ""The products will be beneficial to everyone, including women, to help them keep clean and give them a little bit of dignity as best as we can."" Ms Hussain said she had seen reports emerging from Gaza where women were ""really suffering with their periods"" and using ""old rags"" and ""chopping up old tents"" to cope. ""It's not nice for anybody to have to do something like that, so here we are,"" she said. The all-female team at ISRA-UK embarked on a similar deployment to Turkey last year following the earthquakes in the region. ""What we learnt from that was that largely in conflict and disaster areas, women's needs, their gender-specific needs, are really often overlooked,"" Ms Hussain said. She has previously told how the group had decided to ""persevere"" with their trip despite the news of an Israeli air strike killing seven World Central Kitchen aid workers on 1 April. Ms Hussain said: ""To lose their lives... and leave behind multiple families that are mourning and grieving for them in some of the worst circumstances ever is really quite worrying."" The products in the hygiene kits for women in Gaza were purchased in Egypt with money raised from public donations and fundraisers organised by volunteers in the UK.

271,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68759146,Germany faces genocide case over Israel weapon sales,"Nicaragua has asked the UN's highest court to halt German weapons sales to Israel at the start of a landmark case. Germany is accused of breaching the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel and ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency. Berlin rejects the claims and will present a defence to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Tuesday. In 2023 some 30% of Israel's military equipment purchases came from Germany, totalling €300m ($326m; £257m). The allegations build on a separate case taken by South Africa in January, where judges in the Hague ordered Israel to take ""every possible measure"" to avoid genocidal acts . The court also ordered Hamas to release all hostages taken from Israel during its 7 October attacks immediately. Israel rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself. More than 33,000 have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry there says, the majority of them civilians. Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day. Nicaragua says Germany's arms sales to Israel, which totalled $326.5m last year - a tenfold increase on 2022 - make it complicit in Israel's alleged war crimes. Components for air defence systems and communications equipment accounted for most of the sales, according to the DPA news agency. Germany was also one of 15 Western nations which suspended funding for the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) over allegations that some of the agency's staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel. According to papers filed with the ICJ, Nicaragua wants the UN's top court to order Berlin to halt weapons sales and resume funding of the aid agency, one of the few international bodies still operating in Gaza. It says in the absence of such measures, ""Germany is facilitating the commission of genocide and is failing in its obligation to do everything possible to prevent the commission of genocide"". Speaking as the trial opened, Alain Pellet, a lawyer for Nicaragua, said it was ""urgent that Germany suspend continued sales. ""Germany was and is fully conscious of the risk that the arms it has furnished and continues to furnish to Israel"" could be used to commit genocide, he told judges. Berlin has rejected the allegations, but has remained tight-lipped about its legal strategy ahead of the hearings. ""We note Nicaragua's lawsuit and we deny the allegations as unjustified,"" government spokesman Wolfgang Buechner said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a vocal supporter of Israel's right to self-defence, but he has faced increasing domestic hostility to the continuation of arms sales to the country. On Sunday, a group of civil servants wrote to the German leader calling on the government to ""cease arms deliveries to the Israeli government with immediate effect"". ""Israel is committing crimes in Gaza that are in clear contradiction to international law,"" the statement said, citing January's ICJ ruling. In January's case, the ICJ ruled that ""at least some of the acts and omissions alleged by South Africa to have been committed by Israel in Gaza appear to be capable of falling within the provisions of the Convention"". Michael Becker, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, told the BBC that there was uncertainty about states' obligations to prevent genocide or ensure respect for humanitarian law. The case against Germany, he said, could potentially help clarify the issue. Critics of Nicaragua's case have highlighted the country's chequered human rights record.

272,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68764952,Gazans return to scenes of devastation in Khan Younis,"The devastated landscape of their city feels unreal to the thousands of Palestinians who have been returning to Khan Younis in Gaza. Through the rubble of the streets, they have been filing back on bicycles, donkey carts and by foot, looking for their homes or what trace is left of them. ""I am going to my house, even though I know that it is destroyed. I am going to remove the rubble to get a shirt out,"" Mohammed Abou Diab said. Israel's military pulled troops out of southern Gaza, leaving just one brigade in the area. The smell of death is in the air, residents say, with bodies still lying beneath the ruins. The scale of the devastation has shocked them. ""The destruction is huge. It all needs to be rebuilt. It's not suitable for human beings to live in - not even for animals,"" Abu Saif Abu Mustafa told the BBC. ""It's as if an earthquake hit the city,"" Rashad Khamis al-Najjar from the wider Khan Younis region said as he surveyed the scene. ""The houses are not liveable, the mosques are not suitable for worship, and the roads and the infrastructure, even the electricity, have all been completely destroyed."" Another resident had a similar sense of horror at what he saw on his return: ""We see total destruction everywhere as if it were an earthquake or a natural catastrophe. ""The houses that haven't been destroyed are burned or looted by thieves. We are dying slowly. There are no homes to live in and we live like the dead."" Gaza's second city was the focus of a sustained onslaught by the Israeli army from December, believing that Hamas leaders and fighters had been driven there from the north and established a new stronghold in tunnels and hospitals. Neighbourhood by neighbourhood, Israel ordered Palestinians to leave. The Israeli army said it was doing everything it could to protect civilians. A city of some 400,000 people was deserted bit by bit as Israeli forces mounted ferocious bombardments. Almost from the moment that Israel announced that its mission in Khan Younis was completed and its troops had been pulled out, Palestinians began to move from their overcrowded shelters further south towards their city. But many have found that with their homes rendered unliveable, they have little option but to try to gather what possessions are left and return to their temporary shelters. One woman, Nour Ayyash, said she couldn't reach her apartment because the stairs were gone. Her brother managed to climb up and retrieve some clothes for her children. Another returning resident told the BBC: ""We came to get some of our things, we wanted to see if anything was left of our homes and to take any of our belongings, like clothes for example."" But some would rather stay, even if there is nothing left of what was once their home. Mohammed Abu Rizzeq lost more than his house, his wife was killed in an Israeli bombardment after they were displaced. But he told the BBC: ""Our biggest request is that Israel withdraw from our land - there's been enough killing and destruction. It's better for us to have a tent on the rubble of our homes than being displaced and in exile."" Israel's military stressed a ""significant force"" would remain in Gaza after some troops left southern areas on Sunday. The pull-out is being interpreted as tactical, rather than a sign the war may be moving closer to its end. On Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had set a date for a planned military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where many of those returning to Khan Younis had been sheltering. He gave no details. More than a million Palestinians have sought shelter in Rafah after fleeing fighting in other areas - although that city too has been hit by Israeli air strikes. Mr Netanyahu said Israel wanted complete victory over Hamas. ""This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen - there is a date."" The US has said it won't support a large-scale offensive in Rafah without a credible plan to protect civilians. Ceasefire talks are continuing, with Qatar's foreign ministry telling the BBC it was cautiously optimistic about a new proposal. Hamas - which says it wants a permanent end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an influx of aid as part of any deal - has said that it is studying the latest proposal, without indicating whether its leadership now feels ready to make concessions on its demands. The same is true on the Israeli side. Israel says it wants hostages being held by Hamas to be freed in return for a temporary pause in fighting. But Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said he believes this is an opportune moment to do a deal with Hamas. Meanwhile the leaders of France, Egypt and Jordan jointly called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Emmanuel Macron, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and King Abdullah also warned against an Israeli offensive in Rafah, which they said would ""only bring more death and suffering"". More than 33,000 Gazans have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says, the majority of them civilians. The war was sparked when Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are thought to be dead.",8 April 2024,politics
273,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68757080,"Israel 'can handle' any threat from Iran, says military chief","Israel's military has said it is prepared for any Iranian threat, as tension builds after Monday's attack on an Iranian consulate in Damascus. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack, which Iran said killed seven Revolutionary Guard officers. An Iranian official said on Sunday that Israel's embassies were ""no longer safe"", as it prepares a response. US and Israeli forces in the region have been put on high alert in anticipation of a possible attack. Reports in the US media suggest Iran's retaliation could take place in the coming days. ""The IDF [Israel Defence Forces] can handle Iran,"" Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi said in a televised statement. ""We can act forcefully against Iran in places near and far."" Yahya Rahim Safavi, a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Iran had a ""legal and legitimate right"" to respond to Monday's strike. ""The embassies of the Zionist regime are no longer safe,"" he told Iran's Isna news agency. He did not provide further detail as to what shape Iran's response would take. In a statement, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the defence establishment had completed preparations to respond to any possible scenario. The IDF has halted all leave for soldiers serving with combat units and called up reservists to bolster air defence. Israel has also blocked GPS signals across swathes of the country in order to disrupt missiles and drones. Media outlets in Israel have reported that some of the country's embassies were evacuated over potential Iranian attacks. The BBC has not independently verified those reports and Israel has not confirmed them. In an apparent effort to prevent panic, a spokesman for the Israeli army said there was no need for people to buy generators, gather food or withdraw money. Syria's defence ministry said Israeli aircraft targeted the Iranian consulate building at about 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Monday. Syrian air defences shot down some of the missiles, but others made it through and ""destroyed the entire building, killing and injuring everyone inside"", the ministry added. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said that seven of its officers were killed in the strike, including Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi. Photos and videos from the scene showed smoke rising from the remains of the collapsed building. Hours after the strike, people in Tehran burned Israeli and US flags in protest. On the day after the attack, Ayatollah Khamenei said Israel would ""regret this crime"", while President Ebrahim Raisi insisted it would ""not go unanswered"". Israel and its closest ally, the US, have been anticipating an Iranian attack ever since. In the wake of the attack, the Israeli military said it did not comment on foreign media reports. But an unnamed senior Israeli official told Reuters news agency that those killed had ""been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks"". They also insisted that the embassy ""was not a target"". Israel has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied groups which are armed, funded and trained by the Revolutionary Guards. Iran has said the guards were sent to Syria to ""advise"" President Bashar al-Assad's forces in the country's civil war, but it has denied they have been involved in combat or established bases. Israel's strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria. Iran has avoided direct confrontation with Israel during the conflict so far, but Monday's attack is seen as a serious escalation.",7 April 2024,politics
274,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68755077,Deputy PM: It's still legal for UK to sell arms to Israel,"The deputy prime minister has told the BBC he believes it is still legal for the UK to continue to sell arms to Israel. There have been calls for the UK to stop arming Israel after seven aid workers were killed in Gaza this week. Oliver Dowden suggested the UK would stop supplying weapons to Israel if it was found to be in breach of international law. But Mr Dowden insisted Israel was conducting a ""legitimate"" war. Meanwhile, Labour is calling on Foreign Secretary David Cameron to face questions from MPs on the legal advice he has received on the issue. Israel faced criticism from allies this week after an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) unit attacked a convoy of World Central Kitchen vehicles from the air, killing seven people including three British military veterans. When asked on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg whether Israel was acting within the law, the deputy prime minister said advice on UK arms sales had not changed. However, Mr Dowden's advisers later clarified he was referring specifically to the advice Lord Cameron gives to business secretary Kemi Badenoch about arms sales, rather than independent legal advice. Israel was ""still facing this existential threat from Hamas"" and was ""prosecuting a legitimate war of self-defence"", Mr Dowden said. ""The key thing is, 'is it legitimate, can we lawfully sell arms to Israel?' and yes, that is the case and on that basis... that position has not changed,"" he said. ""We will of course act in accordance with our obligations under law in respect of arms sales."" Earlier this week, former Supreme Court justices were among 600 lawyers who wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a ""plausible risk of genocide"" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as ""wholly unfounded"". On Friday, the Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Alicia Kearns, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK had ""no choice"" but to suspend arms sales to Israel. Mr Dowden was asked about Ms Kearns' claims the government had received legal advice which said Israel had broken international humanitarian law, although this was advisory only. The deputy PM did not directly deny the claims, saying the government would not publish legal advice it had received and that he was ""cautious about getting into individual details"". Mr Dowden said the UK had ""specific concerns"" about Israel's conduct over access for aid workers and civilian deaths and ""Israel has engaged with those"". He also hit out at ""the kind of relish"" he said some were taking in criticising Israel, saying they were ""holding Israel to standards we wouldn't remotely hold other countries to"". He said it was ""all too easy"" for the world to forget ""the horrors of six months ago"", when Hamas launched its deadly cross-border attacks on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed and 253 hostages seized. Since then, more than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, while about 129 Israeli hostages are still missing, with 34 presumed dead. On Sunday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak marked six months since the attack by saying ""the whole of the UK is shocked by the bloodshed"" and called for a ""humanitarian pause"" to allow aid to reach civilians in Gaza. Lord Cameron has warned that UK support for Israel's right to self-defence is ""not unconditional"" and Israel is expected to abide by international humanitarian law. However, in a column in the Sunday Times , Lord Cameron also suggested arms sales should continue as ""so far Hamas has said no"" to a deal for a pause in the fighting. He said: ""We must all continue to work towards this aim, but I believe that failing to prepare for continued conflict will lead to further suffering and avoidable loss of innocent lives. ""The UK stands ready to play its part."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has written to the government calling on the foreign secretary, who as a peer would normally be questioned in the House of Lords, to come to the House of Commons so MPs can question him over the legal advice on UK arms exports to Israel. Mr Lammy said he had ""very real concerns that our obligations according to international humanitarian law... might have been breached"". ""It's hugely important that the UK is not complicit in a breach of international law,"" he said, adding: ""I remain concerned until I have seen that advice."" There are ethical as well as legal questions, said Lord Mark Sedwill, who was the UK's top civil servant before leaving to become a non-executive director at BAE Systems, which is linked to arms sales in Israel. ""There's a separate question,"" he said. ""Even if it's lawful, is it right to continue these arms sales? ""Can they be used to extract some kind of leverage over Israel about the way they're conducting this campaign? ""David Cameron's remarks about our support being not unconditional I think hints that he is thinking in those terms."" Backing Mr Lammy's call for the government to share legal advice with the public, Labour's Baroness Amos urged them to ""publish it and get it over with"", as the Labour government had eventually done with advice over the Iraq War when she was in the cabinet. She said: ""The public want to see the legal advice because they have lost trust in the government and what the government is saying.""",7 April 2024,politics
275,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68735869,Israel-Gaza briefing: Obstacles to peace seem larger than ever after six months of war,"Six months after the Hamas attacks on Israel, war, disease, starvation and death ravage Palestinians in Gaza. Israel is deeply divided, as its prime minister struggles to keep his promise of total victory. The United States, Israel's most essential ally, has turned against the way it is fighting the war. With Iran vowing vengeance for Israel's assassination of a leading Iranian general in Syria, and months of cross-border conflict with Iran's ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, the risks of an all-out Middle East war are increasing. The statistics record the horrors of the past six months. More than 33,000 Gazans, a majority of whom were civilians, have been killed, according to the health ministry. According to Save the Children, 13,800 Palestinian children in Gaza have been killed and over 12,009 wounded. Unicef reports at least 1,000 children have had one or both legs amputated. More than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas on 7 October, and 253 people were taken into Gaza as hostages. Israel says that of 130 hostages still there, at least 34 are dead. A UN team reported in March that it had ""clear and convincing information"" that hostages had been subjected to sexual violence ""including rape, sexualised torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment"". It said there were ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that the violence against hostages was continuing. Kibbutz Nir Oz is right on Israel's border with Gaza. It feels like a time capsule still stuck in the horrors of 7 October 2023. Just after first light on that morning, Hamas broke through the wire. By the time the Israeli army arrived in the early afternoon, a quarter of the 400 or so Israelis who lived there had either been killed by Hamas or taken hostage. Ron Bahat showed me around. He is a man in his 50s who grew up at Nir Oz. Ron survived with his family through good luck and arms strong enough to hold shut the door of the safe room when Hamas entered his house. We walked along the neat lines of small houses, with gardens that are now overgrown. Many had bullet holes or were burnt out and had not been disturbed since the bodies of the dead were recovered. Ron pointed out the homes of friends and neighbours who were killed or taken as captives to Gaza. In one badly damaged house, a pile of neatly ironed children's clothes had somehow survived the fire. The family who lived there did not. One grim irony is that Nir Oz is part of a left-wing movement whose members traditionally support the idea of peace with the Palestinians. Six months after Hamas crossed into Nir Oz, Ron is not ready to make any concessions to Gaza. ""Look, I wish that there will be a leader to bring some prosperity there, because in the end we must have peace. But anyone who supports Hamas is an enemy. The moment they leave their weapons, the war will stop. The moment that Israel leaves its weapons, we will not exist. That's the difference."" In Nir Oz, broken glass still crunches underfoot and gutted houses smell of burnt wood and plastic. No-one is there to clean it up. A few of the surviving residents have come back on short visits, but most are staying away, living in hotels in central Israel. Yamit Avital was back for a few hours, showing around a friend. On that morning in October, she had been staying in Tel Aviv. Her husband was at home and escaped with the children. His brother, living not far away, was killed. Yamit's hands shook slightly when she was talking about coming back to live in Nir Oz again. ""I don't know, it's too early… Maybe only when the hostages come back we can start to think about it. We can't think about it now. I have too many friends there, in Gaza."" No-one has been able to show me around the ruins of Khan Younis or Gaza City, or the tents of around 1.4 million displaced civilians in Rafah, in the way Ron Bahat showed me Nir Oz. That's because international journalists can't report from Gaza, as Israel and Egypt, in control of the borders, have not allowed them in. The only exception has been invitation-only, highly supervised trips organised by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). I have been on one, to northern Gaza in early November. Only a month or so into the war, Israeli firepower had already reduced the area to a wasteland. Evidence is accumulating that both Hamas and Israel may have committed war crimes. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague is investigating Israel for ""plausible"" allegations of genocide against the Palestinians in a case brought by South Africa. The ICJ cannot try a case against Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the US and UK, and many others, as it is not a state. Israel rejects the charge that it is guilty of genocide. For many of its citizens and supporters it is grotesque and offensive to allege that the state created after Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust is itself committing genocide. One of Israel's lawyers, Tal Becker, told the justices in court in The Hague that ""the appalling suffering of civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, is first and foremost the result of Hamas' strategy"". Palestinians see the charges through a different lens, shaped by years of military occupation by Israel. Many Palestinians believe Israel has already created an apartheid state that denies them the most basic rights. In Jerusalem at Easter, a prominent Palestinian Christian political activist, Dimitri Diliani, told me that ""killing children is killing children. It doesn't matter who is the child that's being killed. It doesn't matter who is doing the killing"". ""I recognise the Holocaust, but that does not mean a green light for Israel to commit genocide against my people or any other people."" The ICJ's deliberations will take years and Israel's accusers will have to prove intent to win their case. War and the deaths of civilians do not add up to genocide on their own. South Africa's legal team argues that statements like the one made by Israel's defence minister Yoav Gallant on 9 October show genocidal intent. ""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,"" he said after visiting the IDF Southern Command in Beersheba. ""We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly."" Israel was forced by international pressure, especially from Washington, to loosen aspects of the blockade that the minister envisaged. The amounts reaching Gaza were still grossly inadequate. Six months later, Gaza is facing imminent famine, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) a body backed by governments, the UN and aid groups to provide rigorous and apolitical information and analysis in a food emergency. Oxfam reports that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day - the equivalent of a tin of beans. Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe has also been recorded in detail by Palestinian journalists, civilians posting on social media, and the international organisations running the aid operation, whose staff are allowed to enter the territory. Seven from the World Central Kitchen (WCK), which had been providing millions of meals, were killed by the Israeli army on 1 April. Their deaths outraged President Biden and other Western leaders who are staunch allies of Israel. Their condemnation of the killings left Israel even more isolated. Israel expects no sympathy from much of the world. But it has come to expect support and understanding from powerful Western allies. Instead, they have rejected Israel's claim it does not impede the movement of relief supplies. President Biden extracted unusually rapid concessions from Israel, which promised greater humanitarian access to Gaza in a statement rushed out in the middle of the night here in Jerusalem. Perhaps he threatened to attach conditions to the use of American weapons in Gaza. The killing of the WCK team seems to have been a tipping point for President Biden, whose backing for Israel has been a constant throughout his long career in politics. Supporting Israel is still his firm principle, but the US is no longer prepared to turn that into a safety net for Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist coalition partners. Palestinians ask, with some anger and frustration, why it took the deaths of seven aid workers, including six Westerners, to make a difference, after so many thousands of Gazans had been killed. Aid agencies operating in Gaza say the attack on the aid workers was not an isolated incident, but the result of an engrained disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians. President Biden's outrage might have been a long time coming but it could create a turning point in the war. Over the next month or so, one way of assessing change is simply to count whether Israel is killing fewer Palestinian civilians, or whether increased food and medical aid can save Gaza from famine. Another test will be whether Mr Netanyahu defies American opposition and goes ahead with a ground assault on Rafah, where Israel says the remaining organised units of Hamas must be destroyed. The US says that must not happen until Israel can find a way to protect the lives of almost 1.5 million Palestinians who have taken refuge there. Benjamin Netanyahu has delivered the ""mighty vengeance"" he promised Israelis on 7 October. His other promises, of total victory, the destruction of Hamas, and the return of the hostages have not been achieved. Inside Israel, he faces severe political pressure. His approval ratings in opinion polls have plummeted. In the past week in Jerusalem thousands of protestors waving Israeli flags blocked streets around the parliament demanding the resignation of the prime minister and new elections. ""Netanyahu has an interest to lengthen the war as much as he can, because as long as the war is still going on, he can say that now is not the time for new elections,"" said Nava Rosalio, one of the leaders of the anti-Netanyahu movement. Her group is called Busha in Hebrew, which translates as Shame. ""He says now is not the time to look for who is responsible, which is he. So he prefers to keep the hostages in Gaza, and he prefers to lengthen the war."" When Hamas attacked, Israel was deeply divided over his government's right-wing policies and culture wars between secular and religious Israelis. In the shock that followed reservists who had suspended their military service as part of the protests rushed back into uniform. Demonstrations were paused in the interests of national unity. Six months on, it is no longer considered unpatriotic to protest against the failure to end the war and free the hostages. Israel's divisions are wide open once more. Mr Netanyahu faces searing accusations that his priority is his own political survival. To stay in power, he must preserve his coalition, which is built around the support of ultranationalist Jewish parties. They do not only oppose the mass release of Palestinian security prisoners to buy the freedom of Israeli hostages, without which a ceasefire will not happen. Mr Netanyahu's two main ultranationalist allies, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, go further. They both want Palestinians to leave Gaza so Jews can settle there instead. The prime minister, renowned for his skills in the dark arts of politics, is performing a balancing act to keep them happy while denying that Mr Smotrich and Mr Ben-Gvir's views reflect government policy. Before October, Israel's divisions must have made it look vulnerable to Hamas. Six months on, the same schisms within Israel about the present and the future are making it harder to win the war. Capturing or killing Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza and mastermind of the 7 October attacks, would give Israel a chance to declare victory. But he is still alive, sending his responses to proposals in successive rounds of ceasefire talks from wherever he is hiding. He is thought to be somewhere in the Hamas tunnel network, protected by bodyguards and a human shield of Israeli hostages. Yahya Sinwar must be disappointed that Palestinians on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem have not risen up in support of Gaza. Some must be taking the long view, waiting to see how events unfold in Gaza and the wider Middle East. Others are struggling to feed their families now that thousands of Palestinians are no longer allowed to work in Israel. Some are scared. Israel has launched many deadly raids against armed groups in the West Bank, killing innocent bystanders in the process and arresting thousands who are being held without trial. Some Palestinian farmers have been driven off their land after violent and sometimes deadly intimidation by extremist Jewish settlers. Opinion polls show strong support among Palestinians for the attacks on 7 October, though many deny the evidence that Hamas committed atrocities. At a noisy demonstration against the Israelis in Ramallah in the West Bank, I asked Joharah Baker, a Palestinian activist, whether the Hamas attacks had moved the Palestinians any closer to independence from Israeli rule. She said that was not the point. ""What happened on 7 October is just one thing that happened in many long years of oppression… Our struggle will continue until we are free. That is what any people under occupation, under oppression, under colonial settlers will do."" According to the leading Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki, even those who dislike Hamas approve of the way its attacks have put the Palestinian desire for independence back on the political map of the Middle East. The war has accelerated a new way for that to happen. His latest polls indicate that younger Palestinians do not think the two-state solution of an independent Palestine alongside Israel will ever emerge. Instead, he says, a plurality of under-30s want a single state between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan, in which they believe they could fight and win democratic rights. They compare their fight with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and believe they have a Palestinian Nelson Mandela waiting in an Israeli jail. He is Marwan Barghouti, imprisoned since 2002 and serving five life sentences for murder. If he ran for president, the indications are that he would win easily. Even though he is a leader of the rival Palestinian faction, Fatah, Hamas put Marwan Barghouti's name on the list of prisoners they want released in exchange for hostages. It is impossible to see Jewish Israelis ever giving up the Jewish nature of their state. The fact that Palestinians see that as a possibility is another sign of the distance between them. Six months into the war, there is no immediate sign that it is ending. Benjamin Netanyahu has avoided any specifics about how Gaza would be governed when this war ends, except for insisting that Israel must be in control - in other words, an occupation. He has rejected America's proposal to replace Israeli troops with a force from the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank. The Americans want a PA, revitalised, eventually to govern Gaza. That would most likely require new leadership. Current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is elderly and hugely unpopular. Palestinians say he has failed to fight corruption, failed to show sympathy for Gaza, and failed to order the Palestinian police to protect them from aggressive Jewish settlers while he continues security cooperation with Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu has also rejected Joe Biden's idea of a grand bargain that would transform the Middle East. In return for allowing Palestinian independence, Israel would be recognised by Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis would get a NATO-style defence agreement with the US. Instead, the prime minister tells Israelis that he is the only man who can save them from the mortal hazard of a Palestinian state imposed by America. That is music for the ultranationalists in his government, who are much keener to keep the West Bank and all of Jerusalem than make a deal with Saudi Arabia. Away from the conference rooms where leaders discuss the future, the war has created another enormous obstacle to peace. Palestinians and Israelis have not been as suspicious of each other since the turbulent decades of assassination, hijackings and war in the 1950s and 60s. The pollster Khalil Shikaki identifies an accelerated mutual process of dehumanisation since 7 October. ""The Palestinians are not seen as partners for peace. They are not seen as people who deserve equality because of what they have done on 7 October. So, they [Israelis] question their humanity. We see similar developments, unfortunately, also among Palestinians, who see what is happening in Gaza. ""And they say those who are targeting women and children, deliberately killing entire families, demolishing entire neighbourhoods cannot be humans as well. So, they see them as monsters. ""This dehumanisation is absolutely disastrous for the future."" Additional reporting by Oren Rosenfeld, Fred Scott and Kathy Long",7 April 2024,politics
276,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68754109,Tens of thousands of Israelis rally in Tel Aviv demanding Gaza hostage deal,"Tens of thousands of Israelis have rallied against Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding a Gaza hostage deal. The rallies in Tel Aviv and other cities came after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir. Protesters chanted ""elections now"", and ""Elad, we're sorry"", local media reported. Later, police forcibly dispersed the Tel Aviv crowd. Anti-government protesters were joined by families of hostages held in Gaza. Demonstrators expressed their frustration with the government's inability to free the around 130 hostages who remain in Gaza, held by Hamas and its allies. Earlier on Saturday the IDF recovered the body of Elad Katzir, who was seized and taken to Gaza during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. He appeared alive in a hostage video released in January. ""Elad Katzir managed to survive three months in captivity. He should have been with us today. He could have been with us today,"" protester Noam Peri told a BBC reporter. Organisers said the protest in Tel Aviv had drawn 100,000 people, while other counts put attendance at around 45,000. The demonstrations were the latest of a series of huge anti-government protests demanding that Prime Minister Netanyahu step down, amid fury that he has failed to free the remaining hostages. A car ploughed into crowds at the protest in Tel Aviv, injuring five. Police said the driver was arrested. Some political leaders denounced the apparent ramming attack. War cabinet member Benny Gantz called it ""horrific"". On Sunday - exactly six months since the Hamas attacks triggered the war in Gaza - negotiators plan to meet in Cairo to attempt to reach a ceasefire in the brutal war. According to some media reports, CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will join negotiators from Egypt, Israel and Hamas. Mr Katzir's sister, Carmit Palty Katzir, blamed Israeli authorities for her brother's death in a post on social media, saying he would have returned alive had they agreed a new truce deal. ""Our leadership is cowardly and driven by political consideration, which is why this deal has not happened yet,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""Prime Minister, war cabinet, and coalition members: Look at yourself in the mirror and say if your hands didn't spill blood."" The 7 October Hamas attacks killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians. Over 33,000 people have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says - many of them women and children. According to Israeli counts, 253 Israelis and foreigners were taken during the Hamas attacks. About 129 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. 12 bodies have been recovered by the IDF. Israel gives a slightly higher official figure because it includes four people taken hostage in 2014 and 2015. Two of these are believed to have died.",7 April 2024,politics

But the prime minister said the nation remains ""appalled"" by the deaths of three British aid workers in an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) strike this week. He repeated calls for a ""humanitarian pause"" to allow more aid into Gaza. Separately, the UK announced a Royal Navy ship is to be deployed to the region to help deliver aid. The Foreign Office has pledged £9.7m for aid, equipment and expertise to help an international effort to establish a maritime aid corridor between Cyprus and Gaza. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron warned that the UK's backing of Israel's right to self defence was ""not unconditional"". He wrote in the Sunday Times that ""we expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged in this way"". His comments came almost a week after seven humanitarian aid workers were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, an incident he described as ""tragic and avoidable"". Sunday marks six months since Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages. About 129 hostages remain unaccounted for, with at least 34 presumed dead. Since then, 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza, with more than 75,815 injured, the Hamas-run health ministry says. ""Six months later, Israeli wounds are still unhealed,"" said Mr Sunak. ""Families still mourn and hostages are still held by Hamas. ""And after six months of war in Gaza, the toll on civilians continues to grow - hunger, desperation, loss of life on an awful scale."" He said the UK had been ""straining every sinew"" to get aid into Gaza and that it ""must be flooded in"". He also repeated calls for an immediate humanitarian pause, leading to a ""long-term sustainable ceasefire"". ""We continue to stand by Israel's right to defeat the threat from Hamas terrorists and defend their security,"" said Mr Sunak. ""But the whole of the UK is shocked by the bloodshed, and appalled by the killing of brave British heroes who were bringing food to those in need."" Israel faced harsh criticism from its allies last week, after an IDF unit attacked a convoy of World Central Kitchen (WCK) vehicles from the air. Seven people were killed in the attack, including three British military veterans who were acting as the convoy's security team: John Chapman, 57, James ""Jim"" Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47. Israel said the attack was a ""grave accident"" and has sacked two military officers after carrying out an inquiry. Mr Sunak's comments come after former prime minister Boris Johnson said it would be ""shameful"" for the UK to end arms sales to Israel . Mr Johnson was responding to calls from some MPs to stop selling weapons to Israel after the IDF attack on the WCK aid workers. More than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a ""plausible risk of genocide"" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as ""wholly unfounded"". Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy also called for Israeli hostages to be returned home and condemned the ""intolerable death and destruction"" of the IDF's military campaign. Mr Lammy called for ""an immediate ceasefire"". Announcing the £9.7m aid package for Gaza, Lord Cameron warned in a statement of a real prospect of famine. The foreign secretary said the UK, along with the US, Cyprus and other partners, will set up a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza. The international plan, which aims to be up and running by early May, will see tens of thousands of tonnes of aid transported from Cyprus to Gaza via the pier. The Foreign Office said the UK was continuing to call for urgent changes to the system, known as the deconfliction mechanism, for protecting humanitarian aid workers.",7 April 2024,politics

Elad Katzir was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. His body has been brought back to Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) said. He was identified by medical officials, and his family has been informed. The IDF and ISA said in a joint statement: ""The body of the abductee Elad Katzir, who according to intelligence was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation, was rescued overnight from Khan Yunis and returned to Israeli territory."" They said his remains were located using ""precise"" intelligence. He was buried in the Khan Younis refugee camp, at a site used by ""terror operatives"", a Times of Israel report said. Information about the grave was obtained about a week ago and confirmed on Friday evening. Hours later his body was exhumed and returned to Israel, the report added. Mr Katzir, 47, was abducted from Nir Oz with his mother Hanna, 77. She was released along with 104 other hostages during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November. His father, Avraham, was murdered in the kibbutz, the IDF and ISA said. Mr Katzir's sister, Carmit Palty Katzir, blamed Israeli authorities for her brother's death in a post on social media, saying he would have returned alive had they agreed a new truce deal. ""Our leadership is cowardly and driven by political consideration, which is why this deal has not happened yet,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""Prime Minister, war cabinet, and coalition members: Look at yourself in the mirror and say if your hands didn't spill blood."" In January, Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad published a video purporting to show Mr Katzir speaking from captivity in Gaza. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress. In the video, Mr Katzir said he had been close to dying more than once, and called on the Israeli government to stop the war and bring him and other hostages home. He also repeatedly said he loved and missed his family. Israeli media said that according to IDF estimates Mr Katzir was murdered by his captors in mid-January, soon after the video was published. ""Our mission is to locate and return the abductees home,"" the IDF and ISA said on Saturday. They said they are ""working in full coordination with the relevant national and security bodies and will continue until the task is complete"". Hamas has said it will send a delegation to Egypt on Sunday for a new round of ceasefire talks. Israel said it was undecided on whether to attend, adding that it would be ""more political theatre than actual progress"", Reuters news agency quoted an Israeli official as saying.

Hamas have released a video in which she is seen very briefly. Hersh Goldberg-Polin , 23, a dual US-Israeli citizen, was badly injured in the attack, his family told the BBC. Eyewitness accounts say  he was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck - the last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza. Segev Kalfon , 26, was running away from the festival, across the highway, when he was captured by Hamas, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Orión Hernández Radoux , 30, from Mexico, attended the festival with his girlfriend, Shani Louk. He has not been seen since. The Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. Shani, a German citizen, was initially thought to be among those seized. But on 30 October, her mother Ricarda told German media that the family had been informed by Israeli military of her death following DNA identification. Romi Lesham Gonen , 23, was on the phone to her mother as she tried to escape from the Supernova festival. Merav Leshem Gonan has recounted a conversation in which her daughter begged for help after being shot. ABC News reports that Romi's phone is now in Gaza. Bar Kuperstein , 21, last spoke to his family early on the morning of 7 October, as the attack unfolded. Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information. Eliya Cohen , 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow. The family then found a photo of Eliya in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported. Amit Buskila , 28, from Ashdod, was last heard of making a call to her uncle, Shimon, as Hamas overran the festival. Her family say they have now been told by the government that she is being held in Gaza. Carmel Gat, 39, is Jordan's sister-in-law, and also was seen by her father being taken by gunmen from Kibbutz Be'eri, Haaretz newspaper reported. She has not been heard from since. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during the November ceasefire. Dror Or , 48, was seen by a neighbour being dragged out of his home in Be'eri, according to their nephew Emmanuel Besorai, along with his son and daughter. On Saturday 25 November Dror's son Noam , 17, and daughter Alma, 13, were released from captivity. The body of Yonat, 50 - Dror's wife and the children's mother - was identified among the 120 people murdered at the kibbutz, Yonat's brother told the Guardian newspaper. Tal Shoham , 38, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife Adi, also 38, her mother Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, were released by Hamas on 25 November, along with the couple's children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German/Israeli citizen - was killed on 7 October. Sagui Dekel-Chen , 35, an American-Israeli citizen, has been missing since Hamas's attack on Nir Oz, his father Jonathan told the BBC. He said his son was not found among the dead and the ""only reasonable explanation"" is that he was taken to Gaza. Thailand's ambassador to Israel says 26 of its citizens were taken hostage, 23 of whom have now been released. Those still being held are believed to include Watchara Sriuan, 32. His mother, Viewwaew, told the Thaiger news site that the family had been informed he was being held captive. Kiattisak ""Top"" Patee and a Mr Pongtorn (no first name given) have also been named by the Thai foreign ministry as hostages. A number of other people thought to have been held hostage are now confirmed to have died, either during the 7 October attack or while in captivity. On 16 December, the Israeli military expressed ""deep remorse"" after soldiers mistakenly killed three hostages in northern Gaza who had escaped from their captors. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26. The death of Tamir Adar, 38, was announced on 5 January by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. Other hostages recently confirmed to have died include Gadi Haggai, Ron Scherman, Nik Beizer, Tal Chaimi, an Israeli-Romanian citizen aged 41, Joshua Mollel, a 19-year-old Tanzanian student, 27-year-old Eden Zecharya, and 36-year-old Ziv Dado. Other fatalities include Sahar Baruch, 25, Dror Kaplun, 68, Aviv Atzili, 49, Arye Zalmanovich, 85, Ronen Engel, 54, Maya Goren, 56, Guy Iluz, 26, Ofir Tzarfati, 27, Ofra Keider, 70, and Eliyahu Margalit, 75. The bodies of 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano, and 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss were found by Israeli troops in buildings close to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. In March, the family of Uriel Baruch, 35, said they had been informed by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) that he was killed on 7 October in the attack on the Nova music festival, and that his body was being held in Gaza. He was married with two children. Hostages whose death has been reported, but not confirmed, include Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir.

280,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68748251,Boris Johnson: Shameful to call for UK to end arms sales to Israel,"Former prime minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""shameful"" to call for the UK to end arms sales to Israel. Three Britons were among seven aid workers killed in air strikes in Gaza carried out by Israel's army on Monday . It has led the Lib Dems, SNP and some Labour and Conservative MPs to urge the UK to reassess how it supports Israel. The Foreign Office said it keeps advice on Israel's adherence to the law under review, adding that this is confidential. Writing in his Daily Mail column, Mr Johnson said it would be ""insane"" for the UK to end military support, which he said would be ""willing the military defeat of Israel and the victory of Hamas"". Mr Johnson, a former foreign secretary, wrote: ""Remember that in order to win this conflict, Hamas only has to survive. All they need at the end is to hang on, rebuild, and go again. ""That's victory for Hamas; and that is what these legal experts seem to be asking for."" More than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a ""plausible risk of genocide"" in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim of genocide as ""wholly unfounded"". Three Britons were among the World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers who died in the strikes : John Chapman, 57, James ""Jim"" Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47. WCK founder Jose Andres claimed the Israeli military knew of his aid workers' movements and targeted them ""systematically, car by car"" . Israeli officials reacted by sacking two senior military officers over the strikes , which it has described as a ""grave mistake stemming from a serious failure"". Mr Johnson said it was ""shattering"" to see the deaths, but Israel was sending warnings of their attacks and ""trying to use precision munitions"". Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron previously said the UK would carefully review findings of the initial Israel Defense Forces (IDF) report into the incident, which was released on Friday. Mr Johnson accused Lord Cameron of being silent on the issue, saying the foreign secretary had ""gone into a kind of purdah"" on arms sales. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the IDF military operations which began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages. More than 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza since then, with 75,815 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Reacting to Mr Johnson's comments, a UK Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We keep advice on Israel's adherence to international humanitarian law under review and ministers act in accordance with that advice, for example when considering export licences. ""The content of the government's advice is confidential. ""Decisions on export licences are based on the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria. We would make public any decision to suspend or revoke existing licences."" British arms sales to Israel are lower than those of other countries, including Germany and Italy, and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier, the US.",6 April 2024,politics

Oxfam said its staff, based in the territory, ""are worried about themselves and their families"". On 1 April, seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza . Israel military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, has since vowed to take ""immediate action"" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers. The charity - whose headquarters are in Oxford - said it has 26 members of staff working in Gaza. Oxfam's public health promotion lead Michelle Farrington said they have reported back that ""it's next to impossible for them to be able to do their job safely"". She said: ""They have little confidence in making sure that the details that we co-ordinate with Israeli authorities are being respected."" She also said the amount of assistance being allowed was not enough to ""meet the huge amounts of need that is there"". ""In the north of Gaza, we've undertaken an analysis recently that shows that people are receiving around 12% of their average daily calorie needs,"" she said. ""That works out to be about 245 calories and that's less than a can of beans per person each day."" Ms Farrington said that despite ""all of the complexities and difficulties"", their staff were ""still coming to work and trying to find ways that they can distribute items, food and support their communities"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched an internal investigation into the deaths of the seven aid workers after coming under intense international pressure to explain the circumstances. Its findings were published on Friday alongside an admission of ""serious failure"" and the announcement that an IDF colonel and major were being dismissed as a result. The military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, has also vowed to take ""immediate action"" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers, including the immediate establishment of a new ""humanitarian command centre"" to improve co-ordination. Israel says it has also approved the opening of two humanitarian routes into Gaza , to allow more aid into the territory. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be temporarily re-opened for the first time since the start of the war and Ashdod Port will also be opened for humanitarian deliveries. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.

282,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68746106,Gaza: Israel urged to publish full report on aid worker deaths,"Food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) has called for an independent investigation into the killing of seven of its staff by Israeli drone strikes in Gaza. It comes after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said ""grave mistakes"" led to the fatal targeting of the workers. An Israeli military inquiry led to two senior officers being dismissed. However, the CEO of the aid group said the Israeli military ""cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza"". In a statement, Erin Gore continued: ""[The IDF's] apologies for the outrageous killing of our colleagues represent cold comfort. It's cold comfort for the victims' families and WCK's global family."" She said Israel must take ""concrete steps"" to ensure the safety of aid workers operating on the ground in Gaza, where several organisations have suspended operations in light of the deaths. Israel is under pressure from key Western partners to publish the full findings of its investigation, which have not been made public. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had received the Israeli report and was ""reviewing it very carefully"". He said the US will be ""looking to see not just what steps are being taken, but the results that follow from them"". The Biden administration is facing mounting pressure from some Democrats over its military support to Israel. On Friday, more than three dozen members of Congress, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, signed a letter urging the US president and Mr Blinken to ""reconsider"" the authorisation of an arms package transfer to Israel. The letter called for the US to withhold further arms transfers pending an investigation into the airstrike that killed the aid workers, or if Israel ""fails to sufficiently mitigate harm to innocent civilians in Gaza."" In the space of four minutes on 1 April, the seven aid workers were killed when three missiles destroyed their cars one by one as they engaged in humanitarian work. The charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The IDF said a series of mistakes and miscommunications resulted in them being mistaken for Hamas operatives and targeted. Israel's military said a ""number of armed gunmen"" were in the vicinity of the convoy, but drone operators wrongly tracked cars carrying aid workers. The army apologised after admitting its soldiers did not follow protocols and were not given crucial information about the pre-approved aid mission. As well as the dismissal of a colonel and a major, three IDF commanders have been formally reprimanded and the drone unit responsible has been suspended. UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said British officials were ""carefully reviewing the initial findings"" and called the dismissal of two officers a ""first step"". In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: ""These findings must be published in full and followed up with a wholly independent review to ensure utmost transparency and accountability."" Additional material from the IDF investigation - including video footage purporting to show a Hamas gunman on top of an aid lorry - was shown to journalists in a private briefing ahead of the IDF's public apology, but only a summary of the findings has been made publicly available. The Israeli investigation was carried out via a pre-existing disciplinary procedure which deals with allegations of military misconduct, and was overseen by a reservist major general. IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari described the report as being carried out by a ""professional, independent body that is outside of the chain of command"". On Friday, he told a press conference the findings would be made public in a ""clear and transparent manner"" after being presented in full to WCK and representatives of countries whose citizens were killed in the incident. He said IDF soldiers were ""certain they were targeting Hamas"" but described the strikes as a ""tragedy"" stemming from a ""terrible chain of errors"". Also on Friday, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said 196 aid workers had died in Gaza since the conflict began, adding ""we want to know why each of them was killed"". He told a press conference: ""The Israeli government has acknowledged mistakes - but the essential problem is not who made the mistakes, it is the military strategy and procedures in place that allow for those mistakes to multiply time and time again. ""Fixing those failures requires independent investigations and meaningful and measurable changes on the ground."" The deaths have contributed to growing international pressure over how Israel is conducting the war, which has led to calls for countries to stop supplying Israel with weapons in recent days. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington's ongoing support was contingent on more aid being allowed into Gaza and additional measures being introduced to protect aid workers. Israel later said it had approved the opening of two routes into Gaza for humanitarian deliveries . It is not clear when these would be opened or under what conditions. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be reopened for the first time since the start of the war, and the Israeli container port of Ashdod - which is close to Gaza - will accept humanitarian supplies. More aid from Jordan will also be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.

283,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68745681,"Six months on, how close is Israel to eliminating Hamas?","It has been nearly six months since Hamas fighters broke through from Gaza into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. In response, Israel vowed to ""crush and destroy Hamas"" so that it no longer posed any threat, and to bring all the hostages home. In the brutal war that has followed, at least 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and large parts of Gaza have been destroyed. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters and destroyed much of the vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza, which Hamas has used to carry out attacks. BBC Verify has combed through public statements and social media posts by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and assessed the evidence behind Israel's stated aims. Before 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in Gaza, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. Many of Hamas's senior political figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, widely considered to be the group's overall leader, live abroad. But many of its military leadership structure are thought to be inside Gaza. In a recent statement, the IDF said it had killed about 13,000 Hamas fighters since the start of the war, although it did not say how it calculated that figure. Israel also publishes the names of individual Hamas leaders it says have been killed. A total of 113 people have been named in this way since October, the overwhelming majority of whom were reported killed in the first three months of the war. By comparison, the Israeli army did not report any senior Hamas leaders killed in Gaza this year until March. On 26 March, the IDF said it had killed Marwan Issa, deputy commander of Hamas's military wing. Considered one of Israel's most-wanted men, he would be the group's most senior leader to be killed since the war began. The US has said it believes he was killed, but Hamas has not confirmed it. The IDF publishes names of individuals who it says are senior Hamas leaders who have been killed, but it is not possible to verify whether they are members of the group. One of those named in this category was Mustafa Thuraya, who was working as a freelance journalist in southern Gaza when his vehicle was hit in January. We also found duplicate names in the list, which we have discounted from the total. Outside Gaza, Hamas political leader Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh in January. Israel is widely considered responsible for that attack. However, experts we spoke to said many of the group's prominent leaders in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar, are still believed to be alive. ""The IDF hasn't been able to get to the top brass of the Hamas leadership,"" says Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israeli-Palestinian affairs at the International Crisis Group. ""Both on a symbolic level of getting to the main leaders, and also on the level of replacing Hamas as the holder of the territory, that's something that it hasn't been able to achieve,"" Ms Zonszein says. According to Israeli official figures, 253 people were taken hostage on 7 October . Of these: The youngest confirmed living hostage is 18 and the oldest aged 85. Of the remaining 129 hostages, Israel says at least 34 are dead. Hamas says the number of dead hostages is higher - the result of IDF air strikes. But it is not possible to verify these allegations. The two youngest hostages taken in the Hamas attacks were Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years and 9 months old respectively at the time of their abduction. Their deaths have been reported, but not confirmed. As part of its pledge to eliminate Hamas, Israel promised to destroy the group's extensive tunnel network beneath Gaza, which it uses to move goods and people. ""Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,"" IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said in October. Hamas has previously said that its tunnel network stretches for 500km (311 miles), although there is no way to independently verify this. We asked the IDF how many tunnels, and what proportion of the total tunnel network, they had destroyed. In their reply, they said their forces had ""destroyed a great deal of the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza"". The IDF has occasionally shown evidence of Hamas tunnels they've uncovered. For example, in November, the IDF released video footage of part of a tunnel network underneath the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City which it said was being used as a command centre. To try to determine the extent of the overall network uncovered by the Israeli forces, BBC Verify has reviewed all the IDF messages on the social media platform Telegram referencing tunnels in Gaza, between 7 October 2023 and 26 March 2024. Of these, 198 mentioned the discovery of tunnels, where the army said it had located tunnels or tunnel shafts. Another 141 messages claim that a tunnel has been destroyed or dismantled. Most of those did not give precise details or specific locations, so it is not possible to corroborate the extent of the network the IDF has uncovered or destroyed. The labyrinth beneath Gaza is made up of several components, including tunnel routes and rooms of various sizes, as well as the point at which the tunnel meets the surface - these are known as tunnel shafts. Of the messages we analysed, 36 referenced striking a total of more than 400 tunnel shafts. However, equating a shaft with an entire tunnel would be misleading, says Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare who teaches at Reichman University in Israel. The simple destruction of tunnel shafts leaves the network intact, she says. ""Given the scale and depth of Hamas's tunnel network, it is impossible to fully eliminate all of its underground military structure,"" she adds. Israel's war aims have come at an immense cost to Palestinians in Gaza. More than 33,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's latest demographic breakdown from 5 April indicates more than 70% of those killed were women and children. Many others have been displaced and left homeless as Israeli forces attempt to destroy Hamas infrastructure. Over 1.7 million people have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. Residential areas have been left ruined, bustling streets reduced to rubble, universities destroyed and farmlands churned up. More than 56% of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October, according to satellite data analysis. Six months since the war began, it is still unclear whether Israel has met its aims in the war. Additional reporting by Rob England, Maryam Ahmed, Jamie Ryan and Emma Pengelly. Clarification 9 April: We originally quoted Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak as saying: ""I don't think we've seen a lot of full destruction of tunnels in this war."" However, she was specifically referring to the destruction of tunnels using water. We've subsequently amended this article to include a more relevant quote from her about the difficulty of fully destroying the Hamas tunnel network.

284,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68739978,Israel-Gaza: IDF sacks officers over World Central Kitchen convoy attack,"Two senior Israeli military officers have been sacked after seven aid workers were killed in missile strikes in the Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) called the killing of staff from World Central Kitchen (WCK) a ""grave accident"". Drone operators did not follow rules and thought WCK's cars were carrying Hamas gunmen, its inquiry says. WCK called the IDF's apology ""cold comfort"" for the aid workers' families and urged an independent investigation. The IDF launched an internal investigation into the deaths after coming under intense international pressure to explain the circumstances. Its findings were published on Friday alongside an admission of ""serious failure"" and the announcement that an IDF colonel and major were being dismissed as a result. Three commanders have been formally reprimanded for their overall responsibility in the strikes, which the IDF said were carried out in breach of army rules. The IDF said those who carried out the attack could also face criminal prosecution. In the space of four minutes on 1 April, seven people working for WCK were killed when three missiles destroyed their cars one by one. The charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse, but a series of mistakes and miscommunications on the part of the IDF made them a target. In a briefing for journalists on how the incident played out, the IDF said its drone operator identified what appeared to be a gunman on top of one of the aid trucks being escorted by WCK. After the aid convoy reached its warehouse destination, a car carrying what the IDF said were gunmen headed north, while the WCK aid workers began driving south in vehicles marked with the charity's logo. The investigation found those markings were not visible at night, and attempts to contact the aid workers failed. After a drone operator mistook a bag being held by an aid worker for a gun, the military unit began targeting it with missile strikes. The IDF's internal investigation also found: The unit involved in the attack has been suspended from duties and evidence has been passed on to the Military Advocate General, the Israeli army's top legal authority, the IDF said. In response, World Central Kitchen said the IDF had taken ""important steps forward"" by disciplining those involved in the attack but called for an independent investigation. A statement read: ""It is also clear from their preliminary investigation that the IDF has deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement. ""We demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was carefully reviewing the inquiry and would assess what steps Israel was taking ""to ensure that something like this can never happen again"". Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Szejna demanded a criminal inquiry. One of the seven aid workers killed was a Polish national. The deaths have contributed to growing international anger at how Israel is conducting the war, which has led to calls for countries to stop supplying Israel with weapons in recent days. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington's ongoing support was contingent on more aid being allowed into Gaza and additional measures being introduced to protect aid workers. Israel later said it had approved the opening of two routes into Gaza for humanitarian deliveries . It is not clear when these would be opened or under what conditions. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be reopened for the first time since the start of the war, and the Israeli container port of Ashdod - which is close to Gaza - will accept humanitarian supplies. More aid from Jordan will also be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. There are serious concerns about the welfare of Gazans after aid organisations suspended their operations in the wake of Monday's attack. The United Nations (UN) has warned an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said 196 aid workers had died since the conflict began and called for a ""meaningful increase"" in the amount of supplies allowed into Gaza. Meanwhile, the head of Hezbollah in Lebanon - which is closely allied with Iran - said Tehran would soon respond to an air strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria, which killed a senior general. Israel is widely believed to be behind the strike. Israel has taken steps to prepare for a potential Iranian response, including blocking GPS in much of the country in an effort to hinder guided missiles and drones. On Friday, Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah said: ""The Iranian response is coming without a doubt."" Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.

285,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67039975,What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?,"Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since early October. It began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history. An Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed thousands in the Palestinian territory. On the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets. Those killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival. Hamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages. The BBC has also seen evidence of rape and sexual violence during the Hamas attacks. Hamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007. It has an armed wing and was thought to have about 30,000 fighters before the start of the war. The group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction. Hamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people. These include security raids on Islam's third holiest site - the al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied East Jerusalem - and Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank. Hamas also wants thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israel to be freed and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt - something both countries say is for security. It has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, fired thousands of rockets and carried out many other deadly attacks. Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes and sent troops into Gaza in 2008 and 2014. Hamas, or in some cases its armed wing alone, is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU, and the UK, among others. Iran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training. Israel immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages. Israel launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea. Attacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas. All 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety. Following a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) extended ground operations to southern Gaza. Troops reached the heart of the second biggest city, Khan Younis, where the IDF said it believed top Hamas commanders were hiding. The IDF also pushed into refugee camps in central Gaza. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry . It says most were women and children. Mr Netanyahu said in March that 13,000 Palestinian fighters had been killed , while about a month earlier the IDF said it had killed about 9,000 Hamas fighters, in addition to more than 1,000 of the attackers inside Israel on 7 October. It has not said how it came to this figure. Israel says more than 250 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza. Homes and other buildings in Gaza have suffered from extensive damage and destruction. Most of the 253 men, women and children abducted by Hamas were civilians. They included elderly people and those with disabilities and medical conditions. The youngest was nine months old. In Gaza, Hamas hid them in tunnels and fighters' homes. Unconfirmed reports suggest some have been held by other militant groups. During November's truce, 105 hostages (81 Israelis and dual nationals, and 24 foreigners) were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Four hostages had previously been freed by Hamas and three rescued by the IDF - one on 29 October and two on 12 February . Three hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli troops who mistook them for Hamas fighters. The UN and aid agencies say Gaza is suffering severe shortages of food and other essentials including fuel and medicine. This is particularly acute in northern Gaza, where it is especially difficult to deliver aid which enters the territory from the south. A UN-backed report says the situation across Gaza is turning into a man-made famine. A number of children have starved to death in northern Gaza, the UN says. Humanitarian agencies and Israel have blamed each other. Agencies say Israeli security checks on aid going into Gaza are complex and arbitrary, causing major delays. Israel denies impeding aid and says agencies are failing to distribute the aid that is allowed in. However Israel has agreed to open a crossing into northern Gaza and allow its nearby port of Ashdod to receive shipments of aid, after sharp criticism from the US. That came after the Israeli military killed seven aid workers in a drone attack, an incident which drew worldwide condemnation. Israel said the strike was a ""grave mistake"" due to misidentification. Gaza's health system is in a state of collapse. Medical facilities are overwhelmed by the huge number of injured and are struggling with shortages of staff, medical supplies, food, fuel and water. Hospitals have been repeatedly attacked by the Israeli military, which says it has been targeting Hamas gunmen using the facilities as cover. A two-week raid on al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City in March left the complex in ruins and beyond use. Talks aimed at reaching a second truce have stalled. Hamas says it wants an end to the war, for Israeli troops to withdraw from Gaza, for displaced people to return to their homes and an influx of aid. Israel says it cannot allow Hamas to remain in control of Gaza and wants hostages released in return for a temporary pause in fighting. Israel says it plans to invade the southern town of Rafah, where about 1.5 million Palestinians have crowded to escape fighting elsewhere. But the US - Israel's most important ally - has warned Israel it would not support such an invasion without clear plans for the safety of civilians there. The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel withdrew its troops and about 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005. Home to 2.2 million people, it is one of the world's most densely populated places. Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population are registered refugees, or descendants of refugees, the UN says. Israel controls the air space over Gaza, its shoreline and its shared border, and limits the movement of people and goods. The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories. Along with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century. In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the UN the following year. The West Bank - including East Jerusalem - and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and bodies, although it does not have UN member status. Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist refer to all of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza and Israel as Palestine. The UN considers the West Bank and Gaza as a single Israeli-occupied territory. However, the two areas are run by rival Palestinian administrations. The West Bank is governed with limited self-rule by the Palestinian Authority (PA), under President Mahmoud Abbas, and Israel has overall control. The PA officially recognises Israel. Hamas, in Gaza, does not recognise Israel. The future of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is one of the most difficult issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. An internationally backed plan for peace is known as the ""two-state solution"". It would mean an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel. Israel's most important ally, the US, sees a two-state solution as the way forward once the Gaza war ends. A two-state solution is also formally supported by the PA. However, since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are regarded as illegal by most of the rest of the world, though Israel disputes this. The PA insists all settlements must be removed as part of any future peace deal. The idea of a two-state solution has never been officially advocated by Israel, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly stated his opposition. He says Israel must retain full security control over the West Bank and Gaza.",5 April 2024,politics
286,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68714128,Gaza aid convoy strike: What we know,"The Israeli military has released the findings of its investigation into its attack on a convoy in Gaza which killed seven aid workers. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) say the vehicles were hit by missiles after its drone operators mistakenly thought they were carrying Hamas gunmen. The IDF says it has dismissed two senior military officers and reprimanded two others. Since the attack on 1 April, BBC Verify has been studying images of its aftermath, shared on social media, to try to piece together what we know about the incident. The group of World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers were travelling in three cars - two of them armoured. They were part of a convoy delivering more than 100 tonnes of food supplies from a recently constructed pier to a warehouse in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to WCK. It says their movements had been co-ordinated with the IDF in advance but the investigation has found that this information had not been shared with Israeli drone operators tracking the convoy. The IDF says they had spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry, that was being escorted by the WCK team. Drone footage of this was shown to journalists at an IDF briefing on 4 April but has not been released. The IDF says the convoy was tracked to a warehouse (labelled 'A' on the map) where the aid lorry remained and four ""SUV-type cars"" emerged. It says one contained gunmen - also shown to journalists in drone footage - and headed north but was not targeted because it was close to another aid facility (labelled 'B'). The three remaining vehicles, belonging to WCK, headed south. The investigation says ""one of the commanders mistakenly assumed that gunmen were inside the accompanying vehicles and that these were Hamas terrorists"". The drone operators, the IDF says, had ""misidentified"" one of the aid workers as a gunman - they thought he was carrying a gun when he entered one of the cars but he was holding a bag. The IDF has not shown this footage. The cars were then targeted. Images of the three badly damaged vehicles emerged on social media and have been analysed by BBC Verify to work out where they were struck. They were located along a stretch of road and were 2.5km (1.5 miles) apart, which suggests there was more than one strike. The IDF report confirms this. It says the first vehicle was struck at 2309, the second at 2311 and the third at 2313. The WCK head Jose Andres says those in the convoy had tried to call the IDF during the attack. ""They were targeted systemically car by car. They attacked the first car. They were able to move in the second one. Again this one was hit. They were able to move in (into) the third one."" ""It was a direct hit. They tried to treat some of them and put them in another car in front. But they shelled the car,"" said a local resident, who said he had witnessed the strike. BBC Verify pinpointed the locations of the strikes by matching visual clues in the photos of the vehicles with satellite images of this part of Gaza. In one image of a heavily damaged Toyota Hilux, as well as the trees and fence beside the vehicle, a lone palm tree stands in a walled enclosure with a distinctive pattern of buildings surrounding it. Using satellite images, these features have been matched with a part of Al-Rashid road - which runs along the coast in central Gaza. A second vehicle was pictured with a WCK logo on its roof and a large hole in it. A pylon, a section of woodland, a low wall and two distinct roofs can be seen in the background. BBC Verify matched the scene to about 800m south of the first vehicle. A third damaged vehicle was photographed in an area of open ground to the south, about 100m off the road.The WCK says this third car was a ""soft-skin vehicle"" - meaning not armoured. It was about 1.6km south of the second vehicle and 2.5km of the first. The IDF says drone-fired missiles were used in the attack. This confirms the initial analysis from military experts who we sent images of the vehicles to on 2 April. Chris Cobb-Smith, a former British Army officer and ex-UN weapons inspector, told us the attack was probably the result of drone-launched Spike missiles. Spike missiles are a type of powerful weapon, usually launched against tanks and other armoured vehicles. Justin Crump, a former British Army officer who runs Sibylline - a risk intelligence company - agreed that the attack ""was likely drone-launched and targeted"". The IDF said that the WCK logo - on top of one of the vehicles - was not visible at night to the drone operator. Footage shown at the IDF briefing appeared to confirm this, according to a BBC journalist who attended it. ""The nature of the logos and markings visible on the vehicles, while colourful and suitable for daytime recognition, would appear to stand out much less obviously at night depending on the exact nature of the system used"", Mr Crump told us. WCK had already shared the coordinates and journey details of the aid convoy with the Israeli military. The seven aid workers killed were named by WCK as: Images of the aid workers' bodies were first posted on social media just before 22:30 BST on 1 April. Graphic videos showed the bodies of five individuals. Two more bodies were recovered from Deir al-Balah later on, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said on X. WCK logos were visible on bulletproof vests on at least three of the deceased. Videos also showed colleagues from WCK identifying the bodies. ""These are the people who brought the aid from the sea,"" one said, before crying out as he recognised a Palestinian aid worker killed.

287,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396,Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip. About 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community. The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922. To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move. Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two. Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased. In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented. In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel. It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews. Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the ""Catastrophe"" By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East. Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades. In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state. Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital. In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this. Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt. Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years. Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel. There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence. A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton. In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up. Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal. The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995. In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington. The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground. Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries. Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment. This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the UN says. Palestinians also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis. These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack. But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons. The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel. The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war. The US has however criticised Israel over the scale of the Palestinian death toll and sharp differences have emerged between the two allies over the war. Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack. Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement .",5 April 2024,politics
288,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68742572,Israel-Gaza: Inside IDF's detailed briefing on aid convoy attack,"Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza. Retired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile. The IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone. The military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile. By the end, all the aid workers were dead. The IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening. It also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures. The evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct. In addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded. The IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening. The aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south. During this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage. At this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios. The drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator. The military then tracks the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility. Meanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south. The drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one of the aid workers as a gunman, and claimed to have seen them enter one of the three WCK cars. No footage of this moment was provided, but the military investigation concluded that it was a ""misclassification... they saw that it's a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag"". Under the mistaken belief that one vehicle now contained a gunman, authorisation to fire a missile is sought, and granted by superior officers. At 23:09 the first vehicle is struck, two minutes later the second, and at 23:13 the third final, fatal strike is launched. The military's conclusions are that three major failings occurred:",5 April 2024,politics

The fast food giant was criticised after its Israeli franchise gave away thousands of free meals to Israeli soldiers. McDonald's said it had reached a deal with franchisee Alonyal to return 225 outlets. It said in January the Israel-Hamas war had ""meaningfully impacted"" business. Widespread protests affected sales in the Middle East, Indonesia and France. Alonyal, which is led and owned by chief executive Omri Padan, has operated McDonald's restaurants in Israel for more than 30 years. McDonald's uses a franchise system which means that individual operators are licensed to run outlets and employ staff. The boycott of McDonald's was sparked after Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan issued statements distancing themselves from the firm. Days after the Hamas attacks on Israel last October, and the retaliation by Israel Defense Forces (IDF), McDonald's franchisee said on social media that it had ""donated and continues to donate tens of thousands of meals to IDF units, the police, hospitals, residents around the strip and all rescue forces"". Vocal protests were staged worldwide as the grassroots boycott spread beyond the Middle East. As well as restaurants in the region, McDonald's businesses in France, Indonesia and Malaysia have also been affected. On Thursday, the company said: ""McDonald's remains committed to the Israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward."" It also thanked Alonyal for building the brand in Israel. Mr Padan said: ""We are encouraged by what the future holds."" The US company said the restaurants, operations and employees in Israel  would be retained ""on equivalent terms"" though the terms of the sale were not revealed. Under Alonyal, McDonald's employs 5,000 people. At the start of the year, McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski blamed the backlash on ""misinformation"" but it hit the firm's financials nonetheless and it missed its first quarterly sales target in nearly four years. The boycott was described as ""disheartening and ill-founded"" by McDonald's. The company relies on thousands of independent businesses to own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world. About 5% are located in the Middle East. ""In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald's is proudly represented by local owner operators,"" Mr Kempczinski said at the time. ""So long as this war is going on... we're not expecting to see any significant improvement [in these markets],"" the McDonald's boss added. The company will be hoping that by taking the Israeli business back ""in house"" it can restore its reputation in the Middle East and meet its key sales targets once more. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages. About 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead. More than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry said.

290,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68737846,Israel says it will open new aid routes into Gaza,"Israel says it has approved the opening of two humanitarian routes into Gaza, to allow more aid into the territory. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be temporarily re-opened for the first time since the start of the war and Ashdod Port will also be opened for humanitarian deliveries. More aid from Jordan will be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. It comes hours after Joe Biden spoke with Israel's PM for the first time since seven aid workers were killed . According to a readout of a phone call between the US president and Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Biden warned that Israel must take steps to prevent civilian harm and humanitarian suffering if it wanted to maintain US support. It is understood that the re-opening of the corridors was specifically requested by Mr Biden in the phone call. Mr Biden essentially gave the Israeli government an ultimatum - take concrete steps to prevent civilian harm and ensure safety for aid workers or US policy in respect of Gaza would change. This was a significant shift in US policy - the first time that Washington has attempted to leverage American aid in order to influence the conduct of the war in Gaza. Seven people working for the food aid charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza on Monday. The WCK convoy they were travelling in was hit by an Israeli air strike as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah. The vehicles were around 2.5km (1.5 miles) apart and all three were hit during the attack. Israel's military apologised and called the attack a tragic mistake. It has promised a full investigation. The US National Security Council said it welcomed the steps announced by Israel, which it said ""must now be fully and rapidly implemented"". US policy, it added, would be determined by the steps Israel took to protect ""innocent civilians and the safety of aid workers"". On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there would be a change of US policy if it did not see changes from Israel. The move to open Israel's northern border crossing with Gaza in Erez is particularly significant, after Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Israeli media in November that there would be ""no more contact between Israel and Gaza"". In another development, former US president Donald Trump said Israel should get its war in Gaza ""over with"" in order to achieve peace and ""stop killing people"". Mr Trump - a staunch ally of Israel - made the comments in a radio interview. He said that Israel was ""absolutely losing the PR war"" and should stop broadcasting video footage of its air strikes in Gaza. But he added that Israel had to finish what it had started. Mr Trump, who is expected to be the Republican party's candidate in November's presidential election, has previously criticised Joe Biden for being insufficiently supportive of Israel. Mr Netanyahu has faced rising international and domestic anger at Israel's conduct in Gaza. A long line of lorries filled with aid has been backing up on the Egyptian side of the border with Rafah for months as they can only enter Gaza after a complex and bureaucratic series of Israeli checks. The absence of adequate humanitarian supplies has forced Jordan, the US and UK to drop aid from the air - the least effective way to deliver humanitarian supplies. Air drops have also proved dangerous - Palestinians have been crushed when parachutes fail and have drowned as they try to swim to pallets that have landed in the sea. A recent UN-backed report offered evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine. And the UN's most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, recently told the BBC that there was a ""plausible"" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Israel denies impeding the entry of aid or its distribution inside Gaza, and blames UN agencies on the ground for failing to get the aid that is allowed in to the people who need it. More than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel. Not all were killed while delivering aid. On Thursday GPS was blocked across swathes of Israel in order to disrupt missiles and drones, as tensions rose with Iran. Reservists have been called up to bolster air defence units and the Israel Defense Forces also announced it was halting all leave for soldiers serving with combat units. Iran has vowed to respond after a strike it believes Israel carried out on its consulate building in Syria on Monday killed 13 people, including a senior general. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.

291,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68687749,"Gaza evacuation warnings from IDF contain many errors, BBC finds","Evacuation warnings issued by Israel to people in Gaza ahead of attacks have contained a host of significant errors, BBC analysis has revealed. Warnings contained contradictory information and sometimes misnamed districts. This made them confusing to Gazans seeking safety. Experts say such mistakes could violate Israel's international law obligations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has rejected any assertion the warnings were confusing or contradictory. In a statement, it said the alerts analysed by the BBC were only one element of its ""extensive efforts to encourage the evacuation [of] civilians out of harm's way"". International humanitarian law requires attacking forces to give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit. Israel says its warning system is designed to help civilians flee danger as it continues its war against Hamas. The system divides a map of Gaza into hundreds of numbered blocks. Israel has produced an interactive online map of the blocks that geo-locates users, showing their live location and which block number they are in. This IDF post from late January shows a social media post on X with a link through via QR code to the master block map. But people we spoke to have described struggling to get online to access the system, as well as finding the block system difficult to understand, notwithstanding the errors. The BBC analysed the IDF's Arabic language social media channels on Facebook, X and Telegram, where we found hundreds of posts containing warnings. The same warnings were often posted repeatedly. We also searched for leafleted warnings which had been photographed and shared online. The IDF says it has dropped 16 million such leaflets over Gaza. We have focused our analysis on warnings issued since 1 December, which is when the IDF launched its block system as a way of providing more precise instructions than previously, after coming under international pressure. We grouped all of the IDF's posts and leaflets that we found after this date into 26 separate warnings. The vast majority made reference to the master block system. The IDF told the BBC it also warned of impending attacks through pre-recorded phone messages and live phone calls. Due to damage to Gaza's phone network we have not been able to compile data on these phone calls. And our analysis of leaflets was limited to those we could find photographed and shared online. The 26 separate warnings we found contained specific information from the IDF that people could use to escape areas of danger. But 17 of them also contained errors and inconsistencies. These included: In addition, one warning listed neighbourhoods as being in one district when they were actually in another. Another mixed up the block numbers of two neighbourhoods. And in a third, some blocks listed in the text were on the opposite side of Gaza to those highlighted on the accompanying map. When we put these errors to the IDF, it did not respond to the issues we raised with the maps specifically but said the text of posts had been sufficiently clear. It also said that when arrows were used to direct people to safety, ""it is obvious that the arrows point to a general direction"" and reiterated that the key information had been provided in the text. These inaccuracies and errors may violate Israel's obligation under international law to provide ""effective advanced warnings"", says Janina Dill, co-director of the Oxford Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict. If the majority of warnings contain errors or are unclear to the point that civilians can't understand them then, she says, ""these warnings do not fulfil the proper function they have under international humanitarian law"". This, adds Kubo Macak professor of international law at the University of Exeter, undermines their function to give ""civilians the chance to protect themselves"". In December, Saleh, a tech entrepreneur from Gaza City, was sheltering with his children and his in-laws in Nuseirat in central Gaza - where, he says, there was no electricity or phone signal and long periods of internet outage. He saw people killed and others fleeing from a nearby school as it was being shelled, but says he had not received any IDF evacuation details. Eventually, he found someone with a Sim card that allowed him to access data networks in Egypt and Israel and came across an evacuation warning on an Israeli government Facebook page. ""There was an evacuation order for several residential blocks - [but] we didn't know which block we lived in. This led to a big argument,"" Salah says. Salah could only access the internet intermittently, but he messaged his wife Amani, who has been in the UK since just before the war. She was able to go online and access the IDF's master block map and pinpoint where her husband was. But then, looking back at the specific evacuation warning on Facebook, the couple realised the numbered block where Salah was staying was shown cut in two - adding to the family's confusion. Eventually, Salah decided to leave with the children. But some of his family stayed put - until fighting escalated further. When the BBC analysed the Facebook evacuation warning Salah had been trying to decipher, we found further points of confusion. In text, the post urged people to leave blocks 2220, 2221, 2222, 2223, 2224 and 2225 - all blocks that appear in the IDF's online master map. But in the accompanying map, the six numbered blocks had been lumped into one, and mislabelled as block 2220. Despite these inconsistencies, Israel presented its block warning system at the International Court of Justice in January as part of its defence against allegations by South Africa that it is committing genocide. Israel's lawyers argued that it was doing its utmost to protect civilians and had ""developed a detailed map so that specific areas can be temporarily evacuated, instead of evacuating entire areas"". They presented one social media warning in court as evidence - but the BBC has found two errors in it. Block 55 and 99 were listed in the text of the post from 13 December but they were not shaded on the map. The IDF told the BBC that when a block number is explicitly mentioned in text, the warning is sufficiently clear. Israel's lawyers also claimed that the IDF, via its Arabic Twitter account, was providing information on the location of shelters close to areas being evacuated. But in all of the posts and leaflets we analysed we did not see any warning providing names or exact locations of shelters. BBC analysis has also found the IDF's block system overall was used inconsistently. Nine of the 26 warnings listed a mix of block numbers and neighbourhood names. Another nine didn't mention block numbers at all. Despite linking through to the online master map, they instead listed neighbourhoods by name - which often sprawled over many numbered blocks. The BBC could not find a way to determine the exact blocks of these neighbourhoods. The Abdu family, which includes 32 people, also fled Gaza City to central Gaza early in the war. Then, in December, they received a warning leaflet dropped from a plane. Messages on the family Whatsapp group, which the BBC has seen, chart their confusion as they argued for two days over what the leaflet meant. It contained a list of neighbourhoods to evacuate, but the family couldn't locate most of these places. The warning asked people to leave ""Al-Bureij Camp and the neighbourhoods of Badr, the North Coast, al-Nuzha, al-Zahra, al-Buraq, al-Rawda, and al-Safa in the areas south of Wadi Gaza."" We located an al-Zahra and a Badr close by, but they are north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed. We could not find the neighbourhoods of al-Rawda or al-Nuzha in the ""areas south of Wadi Gaza"". The Abdu family struggled to decide what to do. Should they stay and risk getting caught up in a fierce ground battle - or leave, and abandon the only shelter they might find? Some followed the warning to go to ""shelters in Deir al-Balah"". But when they arrived they felt unsafe and decided to return. If they were going to die they would die together, they told us. Satellite data on destruction in Gaza - analysed by Jamon Van Den Hoek at Oregon State University and Corey Scher of City University New York Graduate Center - shows that the area of Deir al-Balah that the family fled to came under more intense attack during this period than the area that they had left. The IDF told us it had cross-checked ""data regarding civilian presence and movement that followed these warnings"" and that many people did receive and follow them. It said that warnings had ""saved countless civilian lives in the Gaza Strip"".",5 April 2024,politics
292,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68729302,Brother of aid worker killed in Gaza criticises arming Israel,"The family of a British aid worker killed by an air strike in Gaza have criticised the sale of arms to Israel. James Henderson was among seven aid workers who died in the Israeli attack, which his brother called ""inexcusable"". Rishi Sunak is under growing pressure after the strike, which also killed Britons John Chapman and James Kirby, as well as Australian, Palestinian, American-Canadian and Polish nationals. On Tuesday, the PM said the UK had a ""very careful"" arms licensing regime. Earlier, 600 legal experts wrote to the government saying weapon exports must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a ""plausible risk of genocide"" in Gaza. The group of World Central Kitchen aid workers had just unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food aid and the convoy's movements had been co-ordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), according to the charity. Speaking on behalf of the family of former Royal Marine Mr Henderson, his brother - who declined to be named - told the Times the killings of people on a humanitarian mission was ""inexcusable"". ""Accountability is the only hope of justice I have"", he said. ""I don't believe our government will hold the correct people to account, but I guarantee that our government will sell weapons to Israel, which may in turn be used to kill our fellow citizens. ""It's hard to comprehend that."" British arms sales to Israel are lower than those of other countries, including Germany and Italy, and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier, the US. But a UK ban would add to the diplomatic and political pressure on Israel, at a time when its conduct in the Gaza conflict is coming under renewed international scrutiny. The BBC understands there is an ongoing assessment over whether to suspend or revoke existing export licenses to Israel, which is almost finished. That assessment, which will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law, is not a result of the recent air strike. In fact it may not even consider the incident, since it is looking at Israel's actions from early 2024. Technically it is up to the business secretary to decide on issuing arms export licenses, but one MP familiar with the process said, in reality, it will be Mr Sunak who will make the decision when the Foreign Office issues its legal advice. On Thursday evening, former UK foreign secretary Jack Straw told the BBC he believed it was ""perfectly obvious"" Israel was breaching international law. Mr Straw told Radio 4's PM programme that Israeli forces had been ""caught out"" by the killing of Western aid workers but suggested they ""would have dug in and refused any accountability at all"" if all the victims had been Palestinian. Former Supreme Court president Lady Hale was among the lawyers, academics and retired senior judges who signed a 17-page letter to the government on the issue of arms sales to Israel. It says ""serious action"" is needed to ""avoid UK complicity in grave breaches of international law, including potential violations of the Genocide Convention"". The group add that the sale of arms and weapons systems to Israel ""falls significantly short"" of the government's obligations under international law, given the ""plausible risk of genocide"" in Gaza - a situation that the letters says was highlighted in a provisional judgement issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in January - and the worsening humanitarian situation since. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge who was one of the most notable signatories, said the UK had a duty to prevent genocide and there was a ""plausible case that is what is happening"" in Gaza. He added that the ""framework of international law around war"" does not mean countries can act however they want, even if they have been provoked or attacked, ""however outrageously"". Lord Sumption continued: ""It doesn't mean to say that you can indiscriminately slaughter innocent civilians and children. It doesn't mean to say you can attack aid convoys... It doesn't mean to say you can spend two weeks flattening hospitals."" Among other actions the letter says the government must take to meet its obligations under international law are: Mr Sunak called for an independent investigation into the air strike, but stopped short of saying arms sales should end, in an interview with the Sun newspaper after the incident. He added that the UK had been ""consistently clear"" with Israel that it must follow international humanitarian law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the attack as unintended and ""tragic"", and promised an independent investigation. It rejects the claim of genocide as ""wholly unfounded"". The UK has licenced arms to Israel worth over £574m since 2008, when official country-level data was made available, according to pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT). Business Minister Greg Hands has previously told MPs the figure for 2022 - £42m - represented 0.02% of Israel's military imports that year. Arms export licences, which are granted by the business department, cannot be issued if there is a clear risk the weapons could be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Labour has not called for a suspension, but is urging the government to publish internal legal advice on whether Israel is in breach of international law. The SNP is calling for Parliament to be recalled from its current Easter break, ending on 15 April, to debate the issue. Conservative MP Paul Bristow said the idea British-made arms could be used in action that kills innocent civilians in Gaza ""turns the stomach."" But his fellow Tory MP and former home secretary Suella Braverman rejected a ban, telling the BBC ""We owe it to Israel to stand with them."" Speaking during a trip to Israel, she said: ""I think that it would be a tragic shame if we were to walk away from our closest ally in this region."" Fellow Conservative MP Bob Seely, who sits on the Foreign Affairs committee, said those calling on the government to end arms sales were engaging in ""shallow gesture politics"". He told BBC Newsnight ""The reality is that we supply 0.02% of Israel's arms imports, which is a meaninglessly small figure, and actually by blocking it, effectively, this is shallow gesture politics and nothing but."" Mr Seely said the UK should instead ""double down"" on its relationship with Israel. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages. About 130 of the hostages have not been released, with at least 34 of them presumed to be dead. More than 32,916 people have been killed in Gaza since that first week of October, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Additional reporting by Emily Atkinson.",5 April 2024,politics

Mr Flickinger, 33, a US-Canadian, was one of seven people killed in a strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy. Israel's military apologised and called the attack a tragic mistake. It has promised a full investigation. His parents however said that his death was a ""crime"" and rejected the apology. John Flickinger and Sylvia Labrecque said there was a ""hole in their hearts"", and that Jacob's wife Sandy and 18-month old son Jasper were bereft without a husband and father. Speaking from Quebec, they said he and the other workers were killed while travelling on a road designated by Israel as a safe humanitarian route. Mr Flickinger said the charity had reported 24 hours in advance that their convoy would be dropping food at a warehouse, and stayed in touch with the Israel Defense Forces throughout the process, But still Israel attacked and ""they continued firing until all the workers were dead,"" he said. ""Israel owes the families and the world an explanation."" His mother, Ms Labrecque, said that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's description of the attack as a ""tragic accident"" was - in her view - ""a joke"". ""He was such a good human being,"" she said of her son. ""He was extremely devoted to his work and his family."" Jacob, who had previously served 11 years in the armed forces, went to Gaza in March out of a desire to help others, his family said. ""His life has been about service,"" said Mr Flickinger, adding that even despite this, he was worried about his son travelling through a war zone as dangerous as Gaza. ""But [Jacob] felt the World Central Kitchen knew what they were doing there,"" he said, and his son ""knew that people were starving out there"". His parents called on the US to stop sending military aid to Israel while the country was using ""food as a weapon"" - a reference to the lack of aid getting into Gaza. ""The US has great leverage over Israel,"" Mr Flickinger said. Jacob's parents also called for a ceasefire, a return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas and for more aid to war-torn Gaza. Mr Flickinger also said he wanted the US government to launch an independent investigation into the killings of humanitarian workers, as well as for Israel to pay reparations to relatives who have lost loved ones in Gaza. ""Justice can start there, but most critically, end this insanity,"" he said. ""I grew up without having a father,"" Mr Flickinger said. ""Now my grandson will grow up without having his father."" Ms Labrecque said she hoped their grandson, Jasper, would serve as a reminder of their son's life and goodness. ""It's going to be a day-to-day job, to heal from that loss,"" she said. ""But Jasper will be a very good inspiration for us to stay strong."" Mr Flickinger said that he had spoken to the Canadian government, but had not heard from the White House. He said he was told about his son's death from the US embassy in Israel. ""I would like to hear from someone in the US government,"" he said, adding that the Canadian government had been ""very helpful"". WCK - founded by the famous Spanish-American chef Jose Andrés - was one of the main suppliers of desperately needed aid to Gaza, where more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since the 7 October Hamas attacks. Around 200 humanitarian workers in total have been killed in the conflict, according to aid groups. About 1,200 Israelis were killed and 253 hostages were taken by Hamas in its 7 October attack on Israel.",5 April 2024,politics
294,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68735879,Biden says Israel must prevent civilian harm in Gaza to keep US support,"The US has told Israel that its ongoing support on the Gaza war is dependent on ""specific, concrete steps"" to boost aid and prevent civilian deaths. President Joe Biden spoke to Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) staff on Monday. Israel apologised for a ""grave mistake"" but WCK founder José Andrés said his workers were systematically targeted. Mr Biden faces pressure to rein in unconditional military aid for Israel. In a readout of the telephone call between the two leaders, which lasted less than 30 minutes, the White House said that the president ""emphasised that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable"". ""He made clear the need for Israel to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers,"" the summary said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken mirrored the White House statement when he said that if the US did not see changes from Israel, then there would be a change of US policy. Responding to a question of whether that could affect arms shipments to Israel, the White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he did not want to ""preview the steps and decisions"" that were yet to be made. He added that the US expected Israel to improve conditions in Gaza within ""hours and days"". Mr Kirby however stated that US support for ""Israel's self-defence remains iron-clad. The United States isn't going to walk away from helping Israel defend itself"". ""That said, you can say all that and... still believe that the manner in which they're defending themselves against the Hamas threat needs to change."" Israel has yet to comment on the US statements. However, Raquela Karamson, government spokeswoman said before the Biden-Netanyahu call that Israel would ""certainly adjust our practices in the future to make sure this does not happen again"". The US statements are the most strident issued so far on Israel - reflecting President Biden's ""outrage"" at the killing of the World Central Kitchen workers, and signalling that there is a limit to US support. The statement however does not set out which ""US policy"" areas will be affected - but the bedrock to the US-Israel relationship is the supply of weapons. Mr Biden's call with Mr Netanyahu came as the president faced rising domestic anger at Israel's conduct in Gaza, and growing demands from within his party to place conditions on arms transfers. Delaware Senator Chris Coons, a Biden confidant and member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he would ""vote to condition aid to Israel"" if Mr Netanyahu launched his long-threatened offensive on Rafah, where 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are camped, and made ""no provision for civilians or for humanitarian aid"". ""I've never said that before, I've never been here before,"" Mr Coons told CNN on Thursday. ""I've been a strong supporter of Israel the whole time I've served in Congress. ""The challenge is to make it clear that we support the Israeli people... but that the tactics by which the current prime minister is making these decisions don't reflect the best values of Israel or of the United States."" Mr Biden has sharpened his rhetoric over Israel's conduct in the nearly six-month-old war sparked by Hamas's 7 October attack, and voiced his growing frustration with Mr Netanyahu. However, military supplies including bombs, missiles and ammunition have continued to flow from the US to Israel uninterrupted. Mr Biden on Tuesday said that he was ""outraged and heartbroken"" by the deaths of the seven WCK workers, but added that it was ""not a stand-alone incident"" in a war where many aid workers had been killed. He said Israel's promised investigation into the strike ""must be swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made public"". Democratic congressman Jim McGovern, of Massachusetts, said that Mr Biden's call and warning to Israel on Thursday was ""quite frankly insufficient"". ""Simply expressing your deep concern over the terrible tragedy... quite frankly is insufficient. I welcome the shift in tone by President Biden. I think he's deeply troubled by this but I'm not sure Benjamin Netanyahu will be moved by words. President Biden has leverage and he ought to use that leverage."" According to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 33,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in the war. The conflict was sparked by Hamas's killing of more than 1,200 people in Israel and the taking of 240 hostages in its attack on 7 October.",5 April 2024,politics
295,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68711282,Who were the World Central Kitchen workers killed in Gaza?,"Seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) have been killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, the charity's founder says. The victims were British, Polish, Australian, Palestinian and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen, WCK said. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that the Israeli military hit ""innocent people"", describing it as tragic and unintentional. ""It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,"" he said in a video message. Here's what we know about the aid workers killed. Ms Frankcom died ""doing the work she loves"", her family said in a statement. The aid worker from Melbourne, Australia was the WCK's Relief Lead in Gaza. She was described as a ""kind, selfless and outstanding human being [who] travelled the world helping others in their time of need"". ""She will leave behind a legacy of compassion, bravery and love for all those in her orbit,"" they added. Last month, WCK posted a video on X of Ms Frankcom at their kitchen in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, which was newly opened. Dora Weekley, a friend and former WCK colleague, told ABC News that Ms Frankcom was ""dedicated"" and someone who made sure people in need had a hot meal to look forward to every day. Ms Weekley met Ms Frankcom in 2019, when they responded to Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, and worked with her again during the summer bushfires in Australia. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has confirmed Mr Sobol was killed. ""Our brave compatriot, Mr Damian Sobol from Przemysl, helped people in need in Gaza where there is a humanitarian crisis. He was killed during an attack which the Israeli army has accepted responsibility for,"" he said in a video message on X. In an earlier post, he said he had personally asked the Israeli ambassador for an ""urgent explanation"" for the strike. Polish President Andrzej Duda wrote on X that it was ""with deep pain"" that he had learned about the deaths of the WCK volunteers, including a Polish citizen. ""These brave people changed the world for the better with their service and dedication to others. This tragedy should never have happened and must be explained,"" he said. Mr Sobol, from Przemysl in south-eastern Poland, was originally identified by the city's mayor in a Facebook post. Wojciech Bakun called Mr Sobol a ""fantastic boy"" and said words could not describe how those who knew him were feeling. Colleagues of Mr Sobol have posted comments on social media describing how he had taken part in delivering aid to Ukrainian refugees following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mourners gathered in the Gazan city of Rafah on Tuesday for the funeral of the Palestinian driver who was killed in the strike. Hundreds of people mourned Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha, whose body was transported to Rafah, his hometown, where relatives, colleagues and friends carried him on their shoulders. ""He was happy to work with an organisation that provides humanitarian aid to the displaced, our hearts are broken by your death, Saif,"" his close friend Hassan said amid tears, sadness and anger. ""You have hurt us with your passing, and we will not forget you. We pray for your mercy, Saif, and may God give us patience and give patience to your family and loved ones,"" he told the BBC. Three British nationals were killed in the attack. They were all former soldiers who were working for UK-based security firm Solace Global as part of WCK's security team. Mr Chapman was one of the three. His family described him as ""an incredible father, husband, son and brother"" who ""will forever be a hero"". In a statement, they said they were ""devastated"" to have lost him, adding he died trying to help people. ""He will be missed dearly,"" they said. Chris Burns, who served with Mr Chapman in the military, remembers him as a ""very, very bubbly [man who] got on with everybody"". ""He was a very, very funny guy,"" Mr Burns said on BBC World at One. Mr Kirby was born in Bristol and had completed tours in Bosnia and Afghanistan with the British Armed Forces before working as a security consultant. His family said he would be ""remembered as a hero"" who will ""never know the void he has left"". ""James was always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone, even in the face of senseless violence,"" they said in a statement. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kirby's cousin Adam McGuire said he was ""completely selfless"" and ""just wanted to help people"", which is why he had gone to Gaza. Another cousin, Amy Roxburgh-Barry, described him as a ""true friend"" who ""loved his mates, he loved his family."" Mr Henderson was the third British man killed. He had been in Gaza for just over a week alongside with Mr Chapman and Mr Kirby. They were due to return home in days, the BBC understands. The three's roles as security advisers were to ensure the aid convoy travelling in Gaza followed safety procedures and remained on the correct route. Matthew Harding, the non-executive director of the security company that employed them, said all three had extensive experience in risk management and were ""all highly trained, highly professional"". He added that their deaths were ""a truly tragic loss to both us and indeed their loved ones"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Mr Netanyahu on Tuesday evening about the strike. Downing Street said the prime minister told Mr Netanyahu he was appalled by the incident and demanded a thorough and transparent investigation into their deaths. Mr Sunak said earlier he was ""shocked and saddened"" and sent his thoughts to the friends and families of the victims. He added that aid charities should be ""praised and commended"" for their work, which they should be allowed to do ""unhindered"". The dual US-Canadian was born in Quebec and had served 11 years in the Canadian Armed Forces. He had been a volunteer in Gaza since early March. Mr Flickinger's parents told the BBC on Thursday that their son had loved his job. ""The work married his talents,"" his father, John Flickinger, said. ""His love for adventure and his desire to serve and help others."" ""He was such a good human being,"" his mother Sylvie Labrecque said. ""He was extremely devoted to his work and his family."" Mr Flickinger had recently settled in Costa Rica with his partner Sandy and their 18-month-old son, named Jasper. ""Jasper will be a very good inspiration for us to stay strong,"" Mrs Labrecque said. ""Right now, we're still in shock."" US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called the aid workers ""heroes"" who were ""simply trying to help fellow human beings"". He said Washington had spoken directly to the Israeli government and urged ""a swift, thorough and impartial investigation to understand exactly what happened"". Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly echoed the call for a full investigation, and said: ""Strikes on humanitarian personnel are absolutely unacceptable."" More than 196 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October, according to the US-funded Aid Worker Security Database, which records major incidents of violence against aid personnel.

HOME arts venue had said it was axing the event due to publicity generated by a letter from the local Jewish Representative Council. On Wednesday 100 artists began removing their work from the gallery in protest at the decision. HOME apologised for any distress or upset caused. The row developed after the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester (JRCGM) demanded the cancellation of the Voices of Resilience event, slated for 22 April at the city centre venue. The JRCGM raised concerns about the event featuring the work of Gazan writer Atef Abu Saif, who is also minister of culture at the Palestinian Authority. It highlighted reported comments made by Mr Abu Saif in 2014 when he was alleged to have said ""Israel surpassed Hitler's massacres"". Announcing the cancellation of the event on 28 March, HOME said it had taken the decision out of ""concern"" for staff, artists and audience members. Artist Mollie Balshaw, who was among those taking their work down on Wednesday evening, told BBC North West Tonight: ""The decision that they've made is political and it's a decision that I disagree with, as do so many other artists in the show and it felt like the right thing to do."" Maxine Peake, who was due to appear at Voices of Resilience, and fellow actress Juliet Stevenson also joined hundreds of creatives in signing a letter which called HOME's decision ""cowardly"". HOME announced on Thursday afternoon that the event was back on. In a statement posted on its website, the venue said it ""recognised how deeply"" the cancellation had affected communities in the city and further afield. ""We support Palestinian and all community voices, and acknowledge that we can learn from how this was handled. We regret that this has had such wide-reaching impacts"", it said. HOME said it had continued speaking to all parties involved and had been able to ""access additional resources"" to support the delivery of the event. It said it was committed to ""championing equality and diversity"" but acknowledged it had ""work to do"" to restore confidence. Referring to the war in Gaza, HOME said: ""We stand with all innocent victims of this conflict, and call for a humanitarian solution."" The venue said details of the reinstated event would be announced shortly. Comma Press said it was ""deeply moved"" by the solidarity shown by the artistic community in Manchester. ""This is a potential watershed moment in the campaign against the intimidation that arts venues face for showcasing Palestinian artists and voices"", it said. The organiser said it wanted to ""express solidarity"" with HOME staff and added: ""We still have faith in Manchester as a radical place."" The JRCGM, however, said it was ""dismayed"" by the U-turn and denied it had been trying to silence Palestinian voices. It said it had raised ""legitimate concerns of our community around one of the contributors who has made disturbing and inappropriate references to the Holocaust"".

297,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68733267,"Paris 2024: Russia seeking to undermine Games, says Emmanuel Macron","Russia is running a disinformation campaign to undermine the Paris Olympics, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. At the inauguration of a new Olympic swimming centre, reporters asked if he thought Russia was targeting the Games. ""Without a doubt,"" he said, ""including in the field of information. ""Every day (Russia) is putting out stories saying that we are unable to do this or that, so (the Games) would be at risk."" The French government says Russia has recently stepped up propaganda attacks on France, using fake accounts on social media to spread rumours and disinformation. It follows Mr Macron's switch to a more hard-line policy on the Ukraine war , to which he no longer refuses to rule out eventually sending French troops on the side of Kyiv. France believes Russian intelligence was behind the daubing of Israeli Stars of David on Paris walls after the October 7 Hamas attacks, in what was interpreted as a bid to stir up divisions in France. A network of Russian-created websites named Portal Kombat is accused of spreading made-up stories, such as claims that French mercenaries are already serving in Ukraine, or that Mr Macron cancelled a trip to Kyiv because of fears of an assassination attempt. After the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack near Moscow, the French and Russian defence ministers had a rare telephone exchange on Wednesday. According to Mr Macron, this was because France had intelligence information that could help the Russians know more about the alleged attackers, from the Afghan section of the Islamic State group. In his account of their conversation, French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said he told his counterpart Sergei Shoigu that France was concerned about Russian claims that Kyiv was behind the Crocus City Hall attack - claims for which France said there was no evidence. But in his account of the phone call, Mr Shoigu said: ""The Kyiv regime does nothing without the approval of its western minders. We hope that in the case (of the Crocus City Hall attack) the French secret services are not involved."" Asked about Mr Shoigu's remarks on Thursday, Mr Macron said they were ""bizarre and menacing … ridiculous."" The president confirmed for the first time that there are alternative plans for the Olympics opening ceremony in July, if the terrorist threat worsens. Currently the 26 July ceremony is supposed to take place on boats in the river Seine, with more than 300,000 people watching from the quays. However experts have warned that the occasion is highly vulnerable to terrorist attack. ""We will be ready,"" Mr Macron said. ""We are preparing several scenarios. If the threat were to evolve, if we considered that circumstances made it necessary, we have back-up scenarios."" Mr Macron also lent his support to the popular French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, whose name has been mentioned as a possible performer at the opening ceremony.  Critics on the hard-right of French politics say she would not be a good ambassador because the language of her songs is often crude and difficult to understand. ""She speaks to a good number of our fellow citizens and I believe she has every right to be at the opening or closing ceremonies of the Games,"" the president said.",4 April 2024,politics

""We believe this incident relates to a legacy commercial investment which we have already agreed to dispose of."" The council agreed to sell off its commercial investments as part of its annual budget, which was approved by councillors in late-February, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. One of those investments was the offices at Aztec West 600 on the outskirts of Bristol, where Elbit Systems UK is among the tenants. Elbit Systems, based in Israel, is a defence contractor which supplies the Israeli army with equipment. In a statement, Palestine Action said: ""Residents have repeatedly disrupted council meetings to make it clear that simply disposing of the property does not absolve the council of their responsibility and demanded the public body terminate the lease before selling the freehold of the property. ""Despite raising these concerns and lawyers highlighting a legal route for the council to evict Elbit from the premises, the council have failed to do so to date."" The council spokesperson added: ""We have sought to engage protestors over their concerns but today's events show their preference to cause damage rather than engage in meaningful conversation. ""While we respect the right of individuals and groups to protest, we strongly condemn this style of protest damaging a Grade II listed public building."" Avon and Somerset Police said officers had been called to the building just after 07:50 BST to find ""significant damage"". Officers arrested two men and two women just after 08:15 on suspicion of criminal damage. The four - aged in their 20s, 30s and 70s - were subsequently further arrested on suspicion of locking onto a person. They remain in police custody.",4 April 2024,politics
299,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68728378,Fears for Gazans as aid groups halt work over deadly Israeli strike,"Many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip will be wondering how they are going to feed their families after World Central Kitchen (WCK) paused its operations in response to the killing of seven of its aid workers in an Israeli air strike. Another US charity it works with, Anera, has also suspended work because of the escalating risks faced by its local staff and their families. Together, they were serving two million meals a week across the Palestinian territory, where the UN has warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order. WCK's decision to pause its work also led to the ""freezing"" of a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus, which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of Gaza and avert a looming famine. The WCK convoy was hit on Monday night as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah. That barge was part of a four-vessel flotilla that sailed back to Cyprus with 240 tonnes of supplies that could not be brought ashore in the wake of the strike. The Norwegian Refugee Council warned that ""what happened to World Central Kitchen threatens the entire aid system"" and had left it ""on the brink"". WCK accused the Israeli military of a ""targeted attack"" on vehicles clearly marked with the charity's logo and whose movements had been co-ordinated with Israeli authorities. The victims were British, Polish, Australian and Palestinian, and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen. The military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, described the strike as a ""grave mistake"" that had followed ""misidentification at night"". He also vowed to take ""immediate action"" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers, including the immediate establishment of a new ""humanitarian command centre"" to improve co-ordination. ""Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza,"" he stressed. However, aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes. They also assert that this was not an isolated incident, with 196 Palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in October. Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief, told the BBC that WCK was ""among those who have the closest co-operation with the Israelis"", in terms of sharing information about their workers' locations and planned movements. Before the strike, WCK was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in Gaza, with 400 Palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system. WCK has provided 12% of the 193,000 tonnes of aid from international organisations that had reached Gaza since October, according to data from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries. However, UN agencies were responsible for 80% of the total. WCK's founder, the chef José Andrés, told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that it was ""analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do"". Anera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with WCK - said it understood the consequences pausing its own work would have on Palestinians, but that its Palestinian staff had for the first time deemed the risk to their safety and that of their families ""intolerable"". It said the charity's logistics co-ordinator and his son had been killed in an Israeli air strike in Deir al-Balah in March, despite the fact that the co-ordinates of the shelter where they were staying had been provided to the Israeli military. ""We've asked for explanation as to why that site was struck and we've received none,"" Derek Madsen of Anera told the BBC. ""These sites are known and so I think it is very difficult for us to understand how these strikes happen."" Project Hope, another US-based organisation, paused its work for three days in solidarity with WCK and to ""reassess the security situation as we prioritise our staff members' safety"". Arlan Fuller, director of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement sent to the BBC that its employees were deeply concerned by the deaths of the WCK team, and that the strike has raised significant doubts about the effectiveness of co-ordination with the Israeli military. For the people of Gaza, the suspension of WCK's operations ""means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished"", Mr Egeland warned. At least 27 children are reported to have died as a result of malnutrition since October, according to the World Health Organization. Mr Egeland urged Israel to start by opening the Karni and Erez border crossings with northern Gaza to allow aid convoys to drive there directly. Most aid convoys are currently forced to start at the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossings with the south of Gaza and then pass through what the UN calls ""high-risk areas"", mainly due to shooting and shelling or the breakdown in civil order. Cogat says Israeli forces have co-ordinated the entry of more than 500 lorries into the north over the past two months via those routes as well as a new gate and military road that runs south of Gaza City. Israel has also facilitated the now-suspended maritime corridor set up by WCK as well as airdrops of aid by Western and Arab countries. The UN says both are helpful but cannot replace the large-scale delivery of aid by land. The first WCK aid ship was carrying 200 tonnes of aid and took several days to reach Gaza. By comparison, a lorry can carry about 20 tonnes and the nearest Israeli container port is only a 40km drive from northern Gaza. A C-130 transport plane meanwhile has a maximum payload of 21 tonnes, but only about 40 airdrops have taken place so far and they are considered expensive, ineffective and dangerous for people on the ground. The UN says 159 lorry loads of aid crossed into Gaza by land each day on average between 1 and 28 March, and that the pre-war average was 500 lorry loads, including fuel. Cogat says the pre-war average only included 70 food lorries and that 140 entered each day during March. It insists there is no limit to the amount of food and other humanitarian aid that can enter Gaza and accuses UN agencies of failing to distribute aid effectively. There was no apparent drop-off in aid crossing into Gaza following the strike on the WCK convoy, with 217 lorries transferred via Israel and Egypt on Wednesday and 179 food packages being airdropped, according to Cogat. But Nate Mook, who was chief executive of WCK until 2022, warned that the longer-term consequences could be ""devastating"" for Gazans because ""we probably have not seen the last of the aid organisations to pull out"". Zawar Ali of International Medical Corps told the BBC that it was reconsidering its safety protocols and whether to restrict its workers' movements. It had already decided to relocate its field hospital from the north of Rafah to al-Mawasi, an area to the west which the Israeli military has declared ""humanitarian zone"" but has still carried out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets. Dr Bashar Murad, the executive director of the Palestinian Red Crescent, said many of its paramedics were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulances due to the lack of safety guarantees, despite their protection under international law and co-ordination efforts by international organisations. Aseel Baidoun of Medical Aid for Palestinians said it had not suspended operations after a strike in January damaged a residential compound in al-Mawasi that housed the British charity's local team and their families, injuring several people. But now, she added: ""We really are scared of the security [situation]."" ""If a foreigner with international immunity is bombed and killed, then what will they do to us?"" Mohammed Aborjela, a Palestinian online content creator who launched the Youth of Gaza initiative to deliver aid after the war began, told BBC. He said Palestinian aid workers faced higher risks and greater challenges than their international colleagues, but insisted it would not stop him and his colleagues continuing their work. ""The danger of not providing aid is no less important than the danger of being killed,"" he added. Natalia Anguera of Action Against Hunger also said it would try to continue working despite ""more and more challenging"" conditions. ""Most of our staff are... Palestinians. They are suffering themselves, but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate. They want to go on delivering,"" she told the BBC. She said the international community needed to push strongly for a humanitarian ceasefire because it was the only way that aid organisations would be able to scale up their response to the level required. Mr Egeland also stressed the importance of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which he said was ""bigger than the rest of us combined"" but was being ""systematically undermined by Israel"". Israel accuses UNRWA of supporting Hamas, which triggered the war when its gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year. The agency has denied this, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks. UNRWA called for a ""complete reversal in policies"" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.",4 April 2024,politics
300,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"". The government in Berlin is spearheading a plan to help bolster Ukraine's air defences.

302,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

303,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68840261,Ukraine warns of WW3 ahead of long-stalled Congress aid vote,"Ukraine's prime minister has told the BBC there will be a ""Third World War"" if Ukraine loses its conflict with Russia, as he urged the US Congress to pass a long-stalled foreign aid bill. Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - spending 40% of its national budget on armaments while striking deals with Iran and North Korea for ammunition, missiles and drones.",6 hours ago,politics
304,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics
305,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections.

Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
307,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
308,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"".

310,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

311,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68840261,Ukraine warns of WW3 ahead of long-stalled Congress aid vote,"Ukraine's prime minister has told the BBC there will be a ""Third World War"" if Ukraine loses its conflict with Russia, as he urged the US Congress to pass a long-stalled foreign aid bill. Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - spending 40% of its national budget on armaments while striking deals with Iran and North Korea for ammunition, missiles and drones.",6 hours ago,politics
312,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics
313,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons.

314,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
315,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
316,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"".

318,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - spending 40% of its national budget on armaments while striking deals with Iran and North Korea for ammunition, missiles and drones.",6 hours ago,politics
320,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics
321,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",18 hours ago,politics
322,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
323,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
324,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"".

326,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - spending 40% of its national budget on armaments while striking deals with Iran and North Korea for ammunition, missiles and drones.",6 hours ago,politics
328,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics
329,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",18 hours ago,politics
330,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
331,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
332,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"".

334,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured.

336,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics

More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",18 hours ago,politics
338,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
339,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
340,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann told German news agency DPA that the two arrests were ""another significant investigative success"" in the fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's sabotage and spy networks. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"". The government in Berlin is spearheading a plan to help bolster Ukraine's air defences.

342,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured.

344,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared.

345,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",18 hours ago,politics
346,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
347,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
348,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann told German news agency DPA that the two arrests were ""another significant investigative success"" in the fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's sabotage and spy networks. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"".

350,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured.

352,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics
353,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",18 hours ago,politics
354,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
355,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
356,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68843541,German spying: Two suspected spies arrested in Bavaria,"Two alleged spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria. The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Dieter S, 39, is suspected of a string of spying offences. They include plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also accused of fighting for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, the main suspect Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann told German news agency DPA that the two arrests were ""another significant investigative success"" in the fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's sabotage and spy networks. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"".

358,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68842436,EU to tighten Iran sanctions after Israel attack,"The EU has agreed to expand sanctions on Iranian producers of drones and missiles following Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel. ""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"".

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured.

360,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-68819853,"Russia's meat grinder soldiers - 50,000 confirmed dead","Russia's military death toll in Ukraine has now passed the 50,000 mark, the BBC can confirm. In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again.""",16 hours ago,politics
361,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68833833,Ukraine war: Seventeen dead in Russian missile strike on Chernihiv,"A Russian missile attack has killed 17 people in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, according to emergency services. More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoy in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine.",18 hours ago,politics
362,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68825646,"House could vote on Ukraine aid this week, Speaker says","Fresh US aid for Ukraine will be put to a vote separately to the question of new military assistance for Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson says. Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures.",2 days ago,politics
363,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis",3 days ago,politics
364,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68761490,Ukraine war: Russian double-tap strikes hit civilians then rescuers too,"On the night of 3 April, a swarm of Russian drones attacked Kharkiv, in Ukraine's northeast. The country's second-largest city has been targeted almost incessantly since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. But this time was worse than usual, because, when rescue workers arrived at the scene, there was a second strike. Three of them were killed. The following Friday, it happened again when Russian missiles hit Zaporizhzhia, a major city in Ukraine's southeast. Rescuers and journalists rushed to the scene, and then two more missiles hit. In total, four people were killed and more than 20 were wounded, including two local journalists. Both the Kharkiv and the Zaporizhzhia attacks employed a technique called ""double-tap"" - when an initial air strike is followed by a second attack, killing rescuers trying to help the injured. Russia has carried out this kind of repeat attack before. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a strike on a building in the southern city of Odesa in March that killed 20 was a double-tap, and called it a ""despicable act of cowardice"". But Ukrainian officials say they have seen an increase in the use of such attacks. Oleh Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, told Ukrainian media that Russia has started incorporating repeat strikes on its targets ""day and night"". ""The occupiers are using the tactic of double-taps to hit civilian rescuers and other workers who are there first to arrive at the scene,"" he said. On Thursday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it had seen a ""particularly troubling pattern"" of double taps in recent weeks. It called them ""cruel"" and ""unconscionable"" and urged for them to stop. Rescuers from Ukraine's State Emergencies Service DSNS often arrive to deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks before everyone else, and they also say the threat of repeat strikes is becoming ever more frequent. ""Unfortunately, the tactic of double-tapping has been used increasingly often recently. This is difficult to comprehend. The Russians have no right to do this,"" DSNS spokesman Oleksandr Khorunzhy told the BBC. ""They know perfectly well what they're doing, and not just to rescuers, police officers, utility workers or medics. This affects ordinary civilians,"" Mr Khorunzhy said. He called double-taps ""utterly immoral"". ""I can't wrap my head around this, it's just inhuman,"" he said. ""They see perfectly well that unarmed rescuers are the first to arrive at the sites of their attacks."" The DSNS says 91 of its rescuers have been killed and more than 340 injured since the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kira Oves was one of the journalists injured in the Zaporizhzhia double-tap attack. She told the BBC that she had just arrived at the scene of a strike when she heard a whistling sound. ""A colleague shouted: Incoming! On the ground!"" She crouched and heard a massive explosion. She only realised that she was wounded after she felt blood streaming down her face. She and her colleague ran to what they thought was a safe place - only to hear another ""enormous blast"". ""I knelt down, and a policewoman rushed over to me to help close the wound. Another police officer bandaged my head to stop the bleeding. From the shouting we found out that another journalist had been wounded much more badly,"" Kira said. She had not expected two more strikes to follow the one she had gone to report on. Ukrainians targeted by double-tap attacks accuse Russia of trying to crush their fighting spirit and resilience. They also worry that no medic or emergency worker would be prepared to risk coming to their rescue for fear of coming under fire, too. But there are other pragmatic reasons for Russia's strategy too. ""If you abandon any pretence at subscribing to international humanitarian law and even commonly accepted humanitarian norms, then there is a sound military rationale for double-tap attacks because you target high-profile targets,"" says Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think-tank. There is a limited supply of first responders such as medics, emergency personnel and fire crews and they are difficult to replace. ""If you take them out by the second attack on the same spot, at exactly the time when they've congregated to help the victims of the first attack, you're actually achieving quite a lot."" Karolina Hird, an analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War, says double-tap attacks targeting rescue workers could, and likely do, constitute a war crime. ""If, indeed, Russian forces are found to be targeting specifically and intentionally these sections of the population - that would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law and the general rules and norms of armed conflict,"" Ms Hird told the BBC. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross told the BBC that all parties involved in a conflict had an obligation to ""respect and protect"" both the wounded and those who cared for them. If one party chooses to re-attack the same target, international humanitarian law requires them to take ""particular care"" when first responders are trying to evacuate the wounded, the ICRC said. Russia adopted the same strategy previously in Syria, where its troops fought against anti-government rebels between 2015 and 2017. In that case it targeted rescuers from the White Helmets, a civil defence group. ""We have documented hundreds of such cases since Russia intervened in 2015,"" the White Helmets chief Raed al-Saleh says. ""Frankly, the Russian army has no morals when it comes to military operations. It focuses on breaking the will of civilians."" Russia has not explicitly disavowed double-taps, but it has repeatedly denied it aims for civilian targets. ""Our military does not hit social facilities and residential neighbourhoods and does not hit civilians,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in January. But those in towns and cities across Ukraine see the opposite is the case. ""They're using double-taps to kill as many of us as possible,"" says Kira Oves, the journalist wounded in one such attack in Zaporizhzhia. ""But they'll fail, because Ukrainians are survivors. We shall win.""",4 days ago,politics
365,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68806207,Ukraine army chief says Russia making significant 'gains' in east of country,"The head of Ukraine's military has warned the battlefield situation in the east of the country has ""significantly worsened"" in recent days. Fierce battles are ongoing in a several villages in the eastern Donbas region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was benefitting from warm weather - making terrain more accessible to its tanks - and making tactical gains. It comes as Germany said it will give Ukraine an extra Patriot missile defence system to fend off air attacks. In his update posted to social media on Saturday, Gen Syrskyi explained the situation on the eastern front had deteriorated as Russia intensified its armoured assaults. Battles have raged for control of Bohdanivka - a village west of the devastated city of Bakhmut, he said. The settlement lies a few kilometres northeast of the town of Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the town of Avdiivka in February to the south. Ukrainian officials say a slowdown in military assistance from the West - especially the US - has left it more exposed to aerial attacks and heavily outgunned on the battlefield. Despite repeated assurances that he is dedicated to Ukraine's defence, US House Speaker Mike Johnson has failed to advance a new military aid bill. The Democratic-controlled Senate passed fresh funding in February which included $60bn in aid for Kyiv, but conservative Republicans in the House objected to the bill as it did not include funds for border security. Gen Syrskyi said without fresh aid and sophisticated weapons Kyiv would be unable ""to seize the strategic initiative"" from the numerically superior Russian forces. Separately on Saturday, Germany vowed to give Ukraine an additional air defence system. Ukraine has made increasingly desperate appeals for supplies of air defence missiles in recent weeks. On Friday, a major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Trypillya power plant was the largest electricity provider for three regions, including Kyiv, officials said. In response, Berlin has agreed to give Kyiv an additional Patriot missile system. It is capable of intercepting Russia's most advanced munitions, including Kinzal hypersonic missiles. Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russian strikes against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure were causing untold suffering. President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Germany for the decision, calling it ""a true manifestation of support for Ukraine"". Since President Vladimir Putin won his stage managed election last month, Moscow has stepped up air attacks on Ukraine. Russia has, in recent days, unleashed three massive aerial strikes on its energy system, pounding power plants and substations. Elsewhere, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it has foiled an assassination attempt on the governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin. Officials said two men attempted to strike Mr Prokudin's car with a Russian-manufactured drone. ""This was not the first attempt, and probably not the last one,"" Mr Prokudin said a message posted to Telegram. SBU officials also said they had detained 11 networks of Russian operatives since the start of 2024. SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk said in another Telegram post that this was in addition to 47 last year.",5 days ago,politics
366,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68778338,Ukraine could face defeat in 2024. Here's how that might look,"The former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command has warned that Ukraine could face defeat by Russia in 2024. General Sir Richard Barrons has told the BBC there is ""a serious risk"" of Ukraine losing the war this year. The reason, he says, is ""because Ukraine may come to feel it can't win"". ""And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die any longer, just to defend the indefensible?"" Ukraine is not yet at that point. But its forces are running critically low on ammunition, troops and air defences. Its much-heralded counter-offensive last year failed to dislodge the Russians from ground they had seized and now Moscow is gearing up for a summer offensive. So what will that look like and what are its likely strategic objectives? ""The shape of the Russian offensive that's going to come is pretty clear,"" says Gen Barrons. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people reinforced by the use of newish weapons."" These include the FAB glide bomb, an adapted Soviet-era ""dumb bomb"" fitted with fins, GPS guidance and 1500kg of high explosive, that is wreaking havoc on Ukrainian defences. ""At some point this summer,"" says Gen Barrons, ""we expect to see a major Russian offensive, with the intent of doing more than smash forward with small gains to perhaps try and break through the Ukrainian lines. ""And if that happens we would run the risk of Russian forces breaking through and then exploiting into areas of Ukraine where the Ukrainian armed forces cannot stop them."" But where? Last year the Russians knew exactly where Ukraine was likely to attack - from the direction of Zaporizhzhia south towards the Sea of Azov. They planned accordingly and successfully blunted Ukraine's advance. Now the boot is on the other foot as Russia masses its troops and keeps Kyiv guessing where it is going to attack next. ""One of the challenges the Ukrainians have,"" says Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow in land warfare at the Whitehall thinktank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), ""is that the Russians can choose where they commit their forces. ""It's a very long front line and the Ukrainians need to be able to defend all of it."" Which, of course, they cannot. ""The Ukrainian military will lose ground,"" says Dr Watling. ""The question is: how much and which population centres are going to be affected?"" It is quite possible that Russia's General Staff have yet to go firm on which direction to designate as their main effort. But it is possible to broadly break down their various options into three broad locations. ""Kharkiv,"" says Dr Watling, ""is certainly vulnerable."" As Ukraine's second city, situated perilously close to the Russian border, Kharkiv is a tempting goal for Moscow. It is currently being pummelled daily with Russian missile strikes, with Ukraine unable to field sufficient air defences to ward off the lethal mix of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles aimed in its direction. ""I think the offensive this year will have breaking out of the Donbas as its first objective,"" adds Gen Barrons, ""and their eye will be on Kharkiv which is 29km [18 miles] or so from the Russian border, a major prize."" Could Ukraine still function as a viable entity if Kharkiv were to fall? Yes, say analysts, but it would be a catastrophic blow to both its morale and its economy. The area of eastern Ukraine known collectively as the Donbas has been at war since 2014, when Moscow-backed separatists declared themselves ""people's republics"". In 2022 Russia illegally annexed the two Donbas oblasts, or provinces, of Donetsk and Luhansk. This is where most of the fighting on land has been taking place over the past 18 months. Ukraine has, controversially, expended enormous efforts, in both manpower and resources, in trying to hold on to first the town of Bakhmut, and then Avdiivka. It has lost both, as well as some of its best fighting troops, in the attempt. Kyiv has countered that its resistance has inflicted disproportionately high casualties on the Russians. That is true, with the battlefield in these places being dubbed ""the meat grinder"". But Moscow has plenty more troops to throw into the fight - and Ukraine does not. The Commander of US Forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, has warned that unless the US rushes significantly more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine then its forces will be outgunned on the battlefield by ten to one. Mass matters. The Russian army's tactics, leadership and equipment may be inferior to Ukraine's, but it has such superiority in numbers, especially artillery, that if it does nothing else this year, its default option will be to keep pushing Ukraine's forces back in a westward direction, taking village after village. This, too, is a tempting prize for Moscow. The southern Ukrainian city of more than 700,000 (in peacetime) sits dangerously close to the Russian front lines. It is also something of a thorn in Russia's side given that it is the capital of an oblast of the same name that Russia has illegally annexed, and yet the city is still living freely in Ukrainian hands. But the formidable defences that Russia built south of Zaporizhzhia last year, in the correct expectation of a Ukrainian attack, would now complicate a Russian advance from there. The so-called Surovikin Line, consisting of triple layers of defences, is laced with the largest, most densely packed minefield in the world. Russia could partially dismantle this but its preparations would probably be detected. Russia's strategic objective this year may not even be territorial. It could simply be to crush Ukraine's fighting spirit and convince its Western backers that this war is a lost cause. Dr Jack Watling believes the Russian objective is ""to try to generate a sense of hopelessness"". ""This [Russian] offensive will not decisively end the conflict, irrespective of how it goes for either side,"" he says. Gen Barrons is also sceptical that, despite the dire situation Ukraine now finds itself in, Russia will automatically drive home its advantage with a decisive advance. ""I think the most likely outcome is that Russia will have made gains, but will not have managed to break through. ""It will not have forces that are big enough or good enough to punch all the way through to the river [Dnipro]... but the war will have turned in Russia's favour."" One thing is certain: Russia's President Vladimir Putin has no intention of giving up on his assault on Ukraine. He is like a poker player gambling all his chips on a win. He is counting on the West failing to supply Ukraine with the sufficient means to defend itself. Despite all the Nato summits, all the conferences and all the stirring speeches, there is a chance he may be right.",5 days ago,politics
367,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68803936,Ukraine Russia war: BBC Russian journalist Ilya Barabanov branded 'foreign agent',"The Russian justice ministry has labelled two prominent journalists - BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Barabanov and science reporter Asya Kazantseva - as ""foreign agents"". Barabanov has written extensively about Russia's war in Ukraine and the Wagner mercenary group. The BBC condemned the ministry's move against him. ""The BBC strongly rejects the decision,"" a BBC statement said. The ""foreign agent"" label has very negative connotations in Russia. The government has used it to marginalise not only critics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but also voices challenging other Kremlin policies, including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups. One of Russia's most popular novelists - Boris Akunin - was put on the list in January. He is a long-standing critic of President Vladimir Putin. The term ""foreign agent"" recalls the Soviet-era campaign against ""enemies of the people"". ""Foreign agents"" have to identify themselves as such on social media and in other publications, and face burdensome financial reporting requirements. Both Barabanov and Kazantseva are now living abroad. Kazantseva signed an open letter from Russian scientists and science journalists demanding that Russian troops withdraw from Ukraine. She left Russia in January, saying she was being harassed by pro-war figures and seeing her lectures and book presentations cancelled. The justice ministry accused Barabanov - now based in Latvia - of ""spreading false information"" about Russian government decisions and policies, and of opposing the war in Ukraine. The BBC statement condemned the move, stressing that ""the BBC has a global reputation as a trusted and independent source of news"". It went on: ""BBC News Russian has been a vital source of accurate and impartial news to Russian-speakers for 80 years. We are incredibly proud of all our journalists and our priority right now is to support Ilya and all his colleagues to ensure that all are able to continue their jobs reporting on Russia at such an important time.""",5 days ago,politics
368,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68795603,DragonFire: UK laser could be used against Russian drones on Ukraine front line,"A UK high-power laser weapon could be sent to Ukraine to take down Russian drones, the defence secretary says. According to Grant Shapps, the weapon could have ""huge ramifications"" for the conflict in Europe. The DragonFire weapon is expected to be rolled out by 2027, but Mr Shapps said he wanted to ""speed up"" production and make it available sooner. It follows a successful trial of the laser, carried out against an aerial target for the first time in January. The laser was originally expected to be operational by 2032, but new reforms intended to speed up government procurement of weapons mean that it will now be ready five years earlier. Despite this, the defence secretary told reporters while on a visit to Porton Down military research centre near Salisbury that he wanted to speed this up even further. ""Let's say that it didn't have to be 100% perfect in order for Ukrainians perhaps to get their hands on it,"" he said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says the faster timetable comes in response to the ""rapidly changing threat environment"" faced by the UK. ""It's designed to not wait until we have this at 99.9% perfection before it goes into the field, but get it to sort of 70% and then get it out there and then develop it from there,"" Mr Shapps said. ""But 2027 is still the date as of this moment,"" he continued. The weapon is precise enough to hit a £1 coin from a kilometre away, according to the MoD. It is hoped that it will pave the way for a low-cost alternative to missiles, to shoot down targets such as drones. January's successful test of the weapon was carried out at the MoD's Hebrides Range in Scotland and was hailed as a ""major step"" in bringing laser-directed energy weapons (LDEWs) into service. The greatest advantage of lasers is cost and, in theory, an ""unlimited magazine"" of ammunition - as long as there is a reliable source of power. But the big drawback is that they can only fire at targets in the line of sight, unlike most missiles. The US has been testing directed-energy weapons for decades. They have been fitted on to several warships for trials and evaluation. The UK's ambition to do the same by 2027 might be possible, but lasers have not been tried and tested in battle. US warships are still shooting down Houthi drones in the Red Sea with conventional missiles. Any suggestion that UK lasers could be sent to Ukraine to take out Russian drones is optimistic. Ukraine's demands are more urgent. It requires mobile air defence systems which have been proven in battle. With its electrical grid constantly being targeted by Russia, lasers which require a source of power, are unlikely to be the solution to Ukraine's urgent needs. LDEWs use an intense light beam to cut through their target and can strike at the speed of light. As a line-of-sight weapon, it can attack any visible target that is close enough, although the range of the DragonFire system is classified. Missiles can be far more expensive than the drones they destroy, with some costing millions of pounds compared with a few thousand. The MoD says firing the DragonFire system for 10 seconds is the cost equivalent of using a regular heater for an hour, with the operating expense typically less than £10 a shot.",6 days ago,politics
369,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68788110,Ukraine war: Key power plant near Kyiv destroyed by Russian strikes,"A major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes early on Thursday, energy company Centrenergo said. Trypillya power plant was the largest electricity provider for three regions, including Kyiv, officials said. ""The scale of destruction is terrifying,"" said Centrenergo chairman Andriy Hota. Russia has long been deliberately and systematically targeting Ukraine's energy system. Mr Hota told the BBC that Thursday morning's strikes destroyed ""the transformer, the turbines, the generators. They destroyed 100%"". A fire broke out in the turbine workshop of the Trypillya plant - located 50km (31 miles) to the south of Kyiv - following Thursday's large-scale airborne attack. The Centrenergo boss said the plant was targeted by multiple missiles. Staff on shift were able to escape, he said, because they ran for cover as soon as the first drone hit. Residents were urged to shut their windows, charge all their devices and stock up on water. More than 80 missiles and drones targeted sites across Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday. Many targeted energy infrastructure and almost a third made it through Ukraine's air defences. Hours later, Centrenergo confirmed its Trypillya plant had been put out of use. Mr Hota said his company's entire generative capacity in Ukraine was now destroyed. It was one of Ukraine's largest providers of electricity and heat. It operated two other power plants - one in the Kharkiv region which was destroyed in late March, and one in an area of the Donetsk region that was taken over by Russia in 2022. The Kharkiv and the Trypillya plants used to generate some 8% of the country's electricity, according to Mr Hota. The Trypillya thermal plant provided power to the three central regions of Zhytomyr, Cherkasy and Kyiv. The destruction of the Trypillya plant would not be a critical issue for Ukraine in the summer, he believed, although by winter it would become a ""giant problem"". While the plant can be rebuilt with help from spare parts from Europe, he says it will remain vulnerable to attack without Ukraine's allies providing powerful air defences. ""We can repair. We can do the impossible. But we need protection."" At least two more thermal power plants suffered ""significant damage"" overnight in the west of Ukraine, placing even more strain on electricity supply nationwide. The DTEK power company was already down to 20% capacity after repeat attacks in March. The company told the BBC that the latest missile and drone strike on these ""purely civilian power stations"" would make the task of providing critical power to the grid harder. ""Attack by attack, Russia is trying to strangle Ukraine's energy system and with it our hard-won freedom,"" DTEK said. The Kharkiv region in the north-east has been hard hit again after its power plants suffered major damage in late March. The mayor there described the situation as ""very difficult"" and announced more blackouts for households and businesses. For a time on Thursday, the Kharkiv metro stopped running to save power. It has since resumed, but the power supply is dipping and surging so the trains are only working very intermittently. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had been ""obliged to respond"" to the strikes on Ukrainian energy sites following Kyiv's attacks on Russian targets, although this is a war he launched without cause two years ago. ""Unfortunately, we observed a series of strikes on our energy sites recently and were obliged to respond,"" he said. ""I want to emphasise that, even for humanitarian reasons, we did not carry out any strikes in winter. What I mean is that we didn't want to leave social institutions without power - hospitals and the like. But after a series of attacks on our power facilities, we had to respond."" ""Strikes on energy"", he added, were part of Russia's aim of ""demilitarising"" Ukraine - one of his stated goals when the invasion began in February 2022. In a separate development, four people died and several more were injured in the southern city of Mykolaiv in a rare series of daytime strikes on Thursday. The Ukrainian Southern Military Command said on Telegram that private houses, cars and industrial facilities were damaged in the ""insidious"" attack.",6 days ago,politics
370,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68788148,Ukraine war: MPs pass long-awaited law to boost troop numbers,"Ukraine's parliament has passed legislation to help mobilise troops to fight invading Russian forces. The measure - adopted after months of wrangling - is aimed at boosting numbers in the military, which is under severe pressure as Russia continues its advances in the east. But a clause aimed at demobilising soldiers after three years was dropped at the army's request. The president still has to sign the bill into law. Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelensky approved other measures, including lowering the age of mobilisation by two years, to 25. The new legislation passed on Thursday tightens registration processes and strengthens penalties for draft dodgers. MP Oleksandr Fedienko said, quoted by Reuters, that the bill would send a ""message to our partners that we are ready to retake our territory and we need weapons"". Ukraine's military has been under severe pressure of late, in part due to Russia's greater manpower. A senior general told MPs before the passing of the bill that Ukrainian forces were outnumbered by Russia by between seven and 10 to one. ""We are maintaining our defences with our last strength,"" joint forces commander Gen Yuriy Sodol said, quoted by Reuters. ""Pass this law and the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not let down you or the Ukrainian people."" A total of 283 MPs voted in favour of the bill, but 49 opposition lawmakers abstained. One of them, Oleksiy Goncharenko, said he could not vote for a bill that excluded demobilisation. ""The main question for those serving and those who might be potentially mobilised [is] 'how long will I serve?' Without this, I don't think the law will improve mobilisation,"" he said, quoted by the Financial Times. Protesters outside the parliament, many of whom have serving relatives, also criticised the exclusion. ""Our boys and girls in the service are very tired. They have been fighting for two years, and no-one is planning to replace them,"" Keteryna Kulibaba told Reuters. ""For rotation to happen, newcomers have to know how much time they'll have to spend [at the frontline]. ""Undefined mobilisation terms mean fighting forever. Without strictly defined terms, no-one will join the army."" The demobilisation issue will now be considered in a separate bill, parliament officials said. Draconian measures to prevent draft-dodging were also excluded from the latest version of the bill after a public outcry. The main provisions of the bill, which has not yet been published in full, include: The bill was passed hours after the country was hit by more heavy bombardments by Russia. More than 80 missiles and drones targeted sites across Ukraine, many of them involving energy infrastructure. The Trypillya power plant, a key provider of electricity for three regions including Kyiv, was completely destroyed . Ukraine has been asking Western countries to send more assistance, including ammunition and air defences. But a $60bn US military aid package has been held up for months in Congress.",7 days ago,politics
