Now that’s petering out, and prices have fallen,"" she said.UK interest rates hit record lows during the Covid pandemic, but the Bank of England began raising rates at the end of 2021 as it sought to keep control of inflation - the rate at which prices rise.This had a knock-on effect on mortgage rates which also began to increase, making it more expensive to borrow money for buying a house.Mortgage rates peaked last summer and began to fall as expectations grew that the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates this year.This led to a pick-up in activity in the housing market and February saw the highest number of mortgage approvals since September 2022, according to Bank of England data released earlier this week.However, doubts about whether the Bank of England will reduce rates as quickly as some had expected has stalled cuts to mortgage rates, and some lenders have pushed them back up.""The housing market remains sensitive to the scale and pace of interest rate changes, and with only a modest improvement in affordability on the horizon, this will likely limit the scope for significant house price increases this year,"" said Ms Kinnaird.Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals.

That was the best March performance for five years, although sales remain well below pre-pandemic levels.Sales to fleet buyers - which include businesses such as car rental and taxi companies - jumped by 29.6%.However, sales to private buyers fell 7.7%, which the SMMT said reflected a tough economic backdrop of ""low growth, weak consumer confidence and high interest rates"".The industry body also said the decline in market share for electric vehicles ""underscores the need for government to support consumers"".""A sluggish private market and shrinking EV market share... show the challenge ahead,"" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive.""Manufacturers are providing compelling offers, but they can’t single-handedly fund the transition indefinitely.""The SMMT is calling for measures such as halving VAT on electric vehicles and cutting VAT rates at public charging points.Robert Forrester, the chief executive of car dealership group Vertu Motors, told the BBC's Today programme that while there are incentives for companies to buy electric vehicles for their employees as company cars, there are ""no incentives at all in the retail market"".He added that the high cost of electric cars was a deterrent for private buyers, and ""clearly you've got all the issues we've discussed many times about range anxiety and things like that"".A spokesperson for the Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The number of new electric vehicles and plug-ins sold overall is higher than last year, and this is in part thanks to government grants over the past decade, £2bn in investment and ongoing tax incentives.“There are now over a million electric cars on our roads and we continue to help more people to make the switch to electric through schemes such as the £381m Local Electric Vehicle fund to rollout charging infrastructure.”Car manufacturers could face fines if they fail to increase the proportion of zero-emission vehicles sold over the years ahead.Under the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22% of vehicles sold this year must be zero-emission, with the target expected to hit 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.Manufacturers that fail to hit the quotas could be fined £15,000 per car.",4 April 2024,"['the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders', 'SMMT', 'SMMT', 'SMMT', 'SMMT', 'SMMT', 'Vertu Motors', 'BBC', 'the Department for Transport', 'Local Electric Vehicle']",business,0.9999842643737793,Negative,0.14732634586079585,Eco-terrorism,Scandal
