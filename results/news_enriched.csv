They waved Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans outside two gates at BAE Systems munitions plant in Glascoed, Monmouthshire. One banner read, ""BAE stop armed genocide"" while others said ""Welsh weapons cause genocide"" and ""UK weapons kill"". It is one of four blockades at sites across the UK. Many of the protesters covered their faces and said they were demonstrating against the production of weapons, and the war in Gaza. ""Hopefully we can see these places shut down for good,"" said one, Neezo Dahan, who described himself as a human rights activist. ""We are here to demonstrate using our democratic and fundamental right to oppose the ongoing genocide,"" he said, explaining that the protest included various groups, including members of the Wales Peace Coalition. Gwent Police said: ""We're aware of an ongoing protest in Glascoed... our officers are in attendance to facilitate a peaceful and safe gathering."" BAE Systems said: ""The protesters blocked the entrance and that has prevented staff from accessing the site this morning."""

Polish prosecutors said the man, named as Pawel K, was allegedly tasked with collecting information about an airport in Poland used by Ukraine's president. The arrest was made on the basis of Ukrainian intelligence, they added. Authorities did not specify whether the man actually passed any information on. He could face up to eight years in prison if found guilty. The suspect is in custody and the investigation is ongoing. In a statement, Polish prosecutors alleged Pawel K had offered his services to Russian military intelligence. He contacted Russians ""directly involved in the war in Ukraine,"" they added. They said Pawel K had been tasked with collecting information about security at Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport in south-east Poland. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport was a small regional airport. But it has since has become a key hub in the vast operation to supply Western military aid to Ukraine. Military and cargo aircraft from the US and across Europe regularly fly in and out of the airport to deliver supplies to waiting trucks that make the 100km (62 mile) journey to the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian airspace is closed to most flights, so leaders travelling in and out of the country tend to fly in to neighbouring countries such as Poland and travel on to Kyiv by train. Mr Zelensky is known to have flown out of Rzeszow-Jasionka on foreign visits. In December 2022, he flew back to the airport after a visit to Washington. Other foreign dignitaries, such as US President Joe Biden, have transited via the airport on their way to Ukraine. Last year, Polish authorities said they had arrested a group of foreign citizens on suspicion of spying for Russia. They were reported to have installed dozens of cameras, including some around Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport. On Thursday, neighbouring Germany arrested two alleged Russian spies suspected of planning to sabotage German military aid for Ukraine."

""Rio, here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,"" she declared, as the performance got under way. The show was the final stop on the 65-year-old's Celebration Tour, celebrating her 40 years in music. More than 1.6 million fans were estimated to have attended the show. ""Are you ready?"" Madonna posted on her Instagram account seven hours before the show. Crowds of fans were seen dancing along to Madonna's songs played from speakers on the stage, hours before the American superstar arrived. In what many have called a ""historic"" show, Madonna impressed the audience with multiple set and costume changes and light displays. The singer performed some of her greatest hits, including Nothing Really Matters, Like a Prayer and Vogue, and was joined on stage at one point by Brazilian singer Anitta. There were giant screens located along the beach, to ensure the largely Brazilian crowd was able to see the event unfold. Some watched from apartments or hotels, others from boats. There was also a large police presence to ensure the safety of all those in attendance. T-shirts, souvenirs and billboards with Madonna's face decked the neighbourhood as excitement built ahead of the concert. Since she burst onto the UK charts with Holiday in 1984, Madonna has scored another 71 hits, including 13 number one singles. Some, like Vogue, Like A Prayer and Ray of Light, are era-defining anthems. Others, like Live To Tell and Don't Tell Me, are beloved fan favourites. Last year, the superstar was found unconscious in her New York apartment in June and rushed to hospital, where she received treatment for a serious bacterial infection. But she has since returned to full strength and her tour has been marked by her characteristically energetic performances. The Rio concert was the final touch on a tour made up of 80 shows across Europe and North America."

Cheltenham's Cirencester Road Lidl and the Dowty House extension were the unlucky recipients of awards in the Cheltenham Civic Society Awards' new ""UnCivic"" on Tuesday. It came after the public were invited to nominate what they considered to be the worst new buildings. Seven other buildings won awards celebrating their good design. The BBC has approached Lidl for comment. The civic society organises the biennial awards in conjunction with Cheltenham Borough Council to celebrate buildings and places that represent the best recent examples of good architecture and design. The new category was introduced because some ""shockingly bad designs still manage to slip through the planning process"", the council said. Judges said the Charlton King's Lidl was ""an example of where a much-needed local supermarket amenity could have done so much more for the local architectural landscape if it were more motivated by community and less by the need to shout about its brand"". ""The massive brick façade extensions and tower serve only one purpose – to accommodate highly-lit and intrusive signage in relation to everything that surrounds it, destroying a gateway to the town in the process,"" they added. Meanwhile, the Dowty House's extension in Monson Avenue was said to ""fail on every possible count"". ""It is neither in keeping with the original building, nor does it represent contemporary architecture that could juxtapose with the original to bring positive attention to both,"" judges said. The extension, made of ""austere brick"", was accused of blighting the nearby ""scrappy Black & White car park"" with its ""mass and inappropriateness"". “The design seems to make no reference at all to the Victorian gothic Dowty House nor to the pleasant Edwardian houses opposite,"" they added. Several buildings across Cheltenham were celebrated according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service . The Yard in Upper Park Street and Dolder House in Painswick Road were both winners of the new build category. 54 Tivoli Street, Abbeyholme Stables in Lansdown Crescent Lane and St Phillip and St James’ Church won the award in the renovation and refurbishment category. The reinstatement of the railings at Imperial Gardens was the sole winner of the environmental scheme award."

On Monday she went on a one-day visit, on behalf of the Foreign Office, to ""demonstrate solidarity with the women, men and children impacted by the war"". The duchess paid her respects to those who had lost their lives in the town of Bucha during the Russian occupation. There was also a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Royal Family has been unusually outspoken in its support of Ukraine, with King Charles marking the second anniversary of the invasion in February by warning of the ""indescribable aggression"" and the ""unprovoked attack"" by Russia. On his state visits to France and Germany the King had spoken of the importance of supporting Ukraine - and the sympathies of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, had been suggested when she appeared beside a big bowl of flowers in Ukrainian national colours. But up to now none of the royals had come to Ukraine during the war, until this surprise visit by Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, who is married to Prince Edward, the King's youngest brother. During her trip Sophie talked to survivors of sexual violence and torture, and at an evening reception at the residence of the UK ambassador to Ukraine, Martin Harris, spoke about her experience meeting survivors in other countries marred by conflict. ""Women and girls pay the highest price in terms of human costs,"" she said, adding: ""Rape is used to demean, to degrade and to destroy."" Sophie also heard from children who had been returned to Ukraine after being forcibly separated from their families and visited a bridge which was blown up to stop Russian soldiers advancing on Kyiv. In her meeting with President Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska, the duchess gave them a private message from King Charles and discussed support for survivors of sexual violence in conflicts. The duchess has been a supporter of the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative - and Queen Camilla recently spoke of the importance of preventing the sexual violence that all too often takes place in war zones . This unexpected visit is a symbolic message of royal support for Ukraine. Soon after the start of the war in 2022, Charles, then Prince of Wales, visited Ukrainian refugees who had come across the border into Romania. Prince William also visited British troops in Poland near to the Ukrainian border . The royals also appeared to have become embroiled in the disinformation war - with the British Embassy in Russia having to say that claims that the King had died were fake news. Security researchers also warned that social media conspiracy theories about the Princess of Wales were being amplified by Russian disinformation networks. But Sophie has gone a step further with her visit into Ukraine. It adds to her list of trips to places not usually visited by the royals. Last year she became the first royal to visit Baghdad in Iraq, again addressing the issue of violence against women and attending events supporting better access to education for girls. She has also visited Kosovo, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo."

Glenda Kenyon, 70, said her life changed after she answered a letter from the show producers looking for a house on Trinity Street in Barry, the Vale of Glamorgan, in 2006. Her terraced home, set on a steep street overlooking the Bristol Channel, became one of the comedy's main locations which is still visited by regular coach tours. ""I think it's put Barry on the map, she said. ""Since we've had Gavin and Stacey they started building houses, schools. I think that's what we needed."" Glenda's home has had nearly 30,000 visitors, with Gavin and Stacey fans coming from as far away as Australia, Hawaii and India. And could a new episode prompt even more? ""I'm in for it, I am,"" joked Glenda. ""It's bound to get more [busier]."" Glenda, who has lived in Barry for 35 years, said being associated with the comedy has changed her life. When the house is needed, the crew temporarily remove her furniture and replace it with Gwen and Stacey West's interiors - and Glenda is put up in a hotel. What does she want to see in finale? ""I hope they finish off the fishing trip because I am desperate to find out,"" she said. Since the show began in 2007, fans have been sharing their theories on the mystery fishing trip involving Uncle Bryn and his nephew Jason. In the last Christmas special, Bryn and Jason were finally ready to tell the whole family what happened, but they were interrupted. James Corden ended speculation about new Gavin and Stacey material by announcing a final episode of the show will air on Christmas Day. Writing on Instagram , the former talk show host said: ""It's official! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey"". He added: ""See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James."" It confirmed the episode has been written with co-creator Ruth Jones, who has shared an on-screen relationship with Corden in their roles. Viewers will be hoping to find out what has happened between Nessa and Smithy, but also to see how their on-screen son, ""Neil the Baby"", is doing. The final episode could be a bittersweet moment for fans - the 2019 Christmas special was the most watched show in a decade, bringing in more than 17 million viewers . Running for three series between 2007 and 2010, it started off as a BBC Three sitcom but was soon shifted to prime time BBC One. Set in both Essex and Wales, it has become a cult classic, despite only winning a handful of awards at the time; two Bafta TV awards in 2008 and one National Television Award in 2010. It also won a Must-See Moment Bafta in 2020 , voted for by the public, for the moment when Nessa proposed. The show also picked up an impact award at the National Television Awards in 2020 - showing its longevity in the comedy space."

George Lucas put them at the heart of every costume in the Star Wars franchise and they were the favoured backstage dress of Boy George and David Bowie. Now, a collection of Kimono owned by some of entertainment’s most influential personalities has gone on display at an exhibition in Dundee . Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk charts the history of the traditional Japanese dress from its far east origins to the garment’s place in contemporary fashion. More than 300 artefacts, including a collection of the gowns owned and worn by the Queen front man, are featured in the showcase at the V&A until January. The show, which originally opened in London in January, shines a light on their cultural impact in the West – including those in a galaxy far, far away. “You see kimono as being distinctly Japanese, but they also have this universal timeless quality,” said Anna Jackson, curator of the exhibition . “George Lucas was very much inspired by the films of Kurosawa, and at one point it’s believed he considered offering the role of Obi Wan Kenobi to the veteran actor Toshiro Mifune who appeared in Sanjuro. “Mifune didn’t speak English and didn’t think it appropriate so the part went to Alec Guinness but the costumes, part Samurai and part Buddhist monk were inspired by the simple shape of the kimono and I believe the actors referred to them as that, so they knew exactly what they were wearing.” Mifune’s Jedi-inspiring stage costume and Mercury’s favourite cherry blossom gown are among the exhibits on display. The show has been expanded since its London outing for the final stop on its tour. One of the additions is the oldest surviving Japanese robe in the UK.  It belonged to Sir James Dalrymple who added his own family crest to the design, and like many writers and politicians, used his kimono as a house coat or dressing gown when entertaining guests at his home in Newhailes House in Musselburgh in the early 18th century. “It was made in Japan, came to the Netherlands and ended up in Scotland, so it speaks to this amazing cross-cultural connection between Japan and Scotland which stretched back centuries,” said Kirsty Hassard, V&A Dundee curator. Another kimono from the 1920s features a distinctive rose and lattice pattern which echoes the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. “We know Mackintosh didn’t visit Japan but was hugely inspired by what he saw in books,” says Kirsty. “And we think these designers were doing the same, on the other side of the world.” Ms Jackson believes the versatility of kimono is what makes it so enduring. It can be adapted to any shape or size and worn by men or women. In the late 19th century, there was a worldwide craze for Japanese art and design and women started to wear the gowns. “Kimono were exported in large numbers and although you could see it as a sort of cultural appropriation wearing a garment from a country you didn’t really understand, it was also liberating for women who’d been used to wearing corsets,” she said. It was also associated with Bohemianism. The 19th century actress Ellen Terry wore a kimono backstage, when greeting guests in her dressing room. Alexander McQueen helped Bjork create the iconic cover of her 1997 album Homogenic and the film Memoirs of a Geisha fostered even more interest in the garment, while they were also a favourite of the German-American actress and singer Marlene Dietrich. “Freddie Mercury had hundreds of kimono, some of which he wore on stage, but some he wore at home like the one we have in the show. For him it was a way of transcending cultural identity but also sexual identity,” Ms Jackson said. Far from being a traditional unchanging garment, the kimono has continued to evolve, and is enjoying a revival on the streets of Japan thanks to a new generation of contemporary designers and stylists. Here in the UK, it has been a fixture of fashion for more than a century, and the trend continues on the catwalk and at music festivals. Although the show hasn’t been made in-house, it’s an important one for V&A Dundee, which was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma in 2018. “It’s lovely to be hosting it,” said Leonie Bell, director of V&A Dundee “We feel like we’re a little bit of Japan by the banks of the Tay.” V&A Dundee has faced a number of challenges in its short existence, but they’re keen to face them head on, and they believe this ticketed show, on the back of last year’s Tartan exhibition will help enormously. “We’re looking at a global tour of Tartan. That was game changing for us at the V&A,” said Ms Bell. “The thought of seeing it go round the world, and follow it with Kimono feels good. It feels like a demonstration, not just of what V&A Dundee can do, not just what Dundee can do, but what the whole cultural sector in Scotland can do.”"

Natalia Negreba has recently had root canal work done in the city of Dnipro. The 36-year-old said she was in ""excruciating"" pain, but could not find NHS dental care or afford to pay for private treatment. The care board that covers Wiltshire said it had laid on ""additional urgent dental care appointments"" since 2021. Dnipro, which is fewer than 100km (62 miles) from the front line, was on the receiving end of a devastating wave of attacks by Russian forces in December. The Ukrainian air force said it had ""never seen so many locations targeted simultaneously"" after Russia launched 158 drones and missiles . Despite the danger the city has faced since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, Mrs Negriba says she returned with her three-year-old daughter Agnia in July 2023 because she was in so much pain. ""I started looking for a dentist but I didn't find any [NHS clinics]. It was very terrible because I took paracetamol and ibuprofen every day. My pain didn't go away,"" she said. ""My friend helped me make an appointment at a private clinic in Corsham but it would have cost £800 - which was too much for me, it's very expensive. ""Dnipro is very dangerous, and I was very worried when I went [back], but my pain was very strong. I could not stay here."" Mrs Negriba, who moved to Corsham at the start of the war, told the BBC she would often hear air raid alarms when she was in Dnipro, where her treatment cost about £150 for a root canal procedure and an implant. She said she also has a friend from Chippenham who had also travelled to Dnipro for dental care. Mrs Negriba added: ""I had a very long wait, too much. I didn't find an NHS dentist. ""If I have a new problem with my tooth, I will fly to Ukraine to have it fixed again."" Liz Taylor, from Chippenham, runs Bybrook Homes for Ukraine, which supports about 50 Ukrainian refugees living in Wiltshire. She said other patients have revisited their mother country to get dental care, with some of them having ""severe dental problems"". ""We've either had to pay ourselves for them to receive treatment, or they have gone back to Ukraine - much to our horror - and to some of the really dangerous parts of Ukraine in the east, near the Russian border, because of toothache,"" said Mrs Taylor. She added that she was also supporting another woman who was considering going back to Kharkiv, which is right next to the front line and a place Mrs Taylor considers even more dangerous than Dnipro. Kateryna Lagun, Mrs Negriba's dentist in Dnipro, said she had treated several Ukrainians who had travelled from the UK. ""We have a lot of people coming from outside of Ukraine to get their treatment,"" she said. ""Dnipro is quite dangerous because we have a lot of air attacks at night, and up to 15 air raid warnings a day. ""I live really close to the [bombed] factory here and several times I thought it was the end because it [the bombing] was really close to us. ""I guess they do not have much choice in the UK. I heard you have this situation with NHS dentistry and even UK citizens cannot get the proper treatment."" A spokesperson for the Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Integrated Care Board said it would not comment on individual cases but that in this case Mrs Negriba may meet the criteria for ""an urgent dental or a stabilisation appointment"". ""Since September 2021 we have commissioned additional urgent dental care appointments that people can access by calling NHS111 with an urgent dental need,"" they added. ""There are 390 appointments every week across the South West, with 86 urgent dental appointments in Wiltshire each week."" The board said there were also 750 stabilisation appointments across the South West, which were for people who had a serious but not urgent dental issue. It said Mrs Negriba should contact the board to discuss her treatment. Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook , X and Instagram . Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630 ."

Protesters had occupied some buildings to demand that the university cut ties with Israel over the way it is conducting its war in the Gaza Strip. After their removal, groups headed to the Panthéon to continue their action. Pro-Palestinian protests have been taking part in university campuses in several countries, most notably the US, over the past few days.  In Paris, dozens of riot police went into the buildings on Friday morning. They came out with defiant protesters. One of them said officials had given them an ultimatum to leave within 20 minutes, but that students had defied the order. Paris police said  ""91 people were removed without incident"". Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's office was equally determined, saying the authorities would deal with such protests firmly.  Sciences Po closed its main buildings on Friday in response to the sit-in. A spokesperson said some of the Sciences Po campuses in Reims, Le Havre and Poitiers were also affected by protests. Similar protests were held in Lyons and Lille. But the protests in France have been more contained than in the US, a point emphasised by Mr Attal on Thursday. ""In contrast to what we see abroad, namely across the Atlantic, no permanent protest camp... has been established in France,"" the prime minister said. He was referring to the days-long camps set up in several American universities, which police have had to dismantle with the arrest of hundreds of people . Israel has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza. The UN's most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, has told the BBC that there is a ""plausible"" case that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Israel denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. More than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that ""the time is now"" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. He said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it. Mediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. It reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners."

Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art appealed on Tuesday to reverse the ruling, arguing it took ""too narrow a view on women's historical and ongoing societal disadvantage"" and how the Ladies Lounge can ""promote equal opportunity"". The court issued its order in April following a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by New South Wales resident Jason Lau, who was denied entry into the lounge. Kirsha Kaechele, the artist behind the lounge, has said she will challenge the ruling by making the space ""compliant"" with regulations. The lounge, which contains some of the museum's most-acclaimed works - from Picasso to Sidney Nolan - has been closed to the public since the court's order. Ms Kaechele's plans involve transforming the velvet-clad lounge into a women's toilet and a church - which she claims will allow it to continue operating as a women-only space under legal exemptions. “There is a fabulous toilet coming to the Ladies Lounge, and so in that sense the Ladies Lounge will operate as a ladies’ room. ""It’s a toilet that is celebrated the world round. It is the greatest toilet, and men won’t be allowed to see it,""  Ms Kaechele said in Australian media reports.  Some of the key artworks, like the ones by Picasso, will be moved into the museum's existing ladies toilet to ensure ""uninterrupted viewing"" while she applies for other exemptions. And only on Sundays, men would be allowed into the space - to learn ironing and laundry folding. ""Women can bring in all their clean laundry and the men can go through a series of graceful movements (designed by a Rinpoche and refined by tai chi masters) to fold them,"" she said, in an interview published by the museum on Tuesday. Mr Lau's lawsuit has been a ""blessing in disguise"", she said. ""Thanks to the ruling, we have no choice but to open ourselves to a whole range of enriching experiences - spiritual, educational... to discover fascinating new possibilities, and to become better,"" she said.

Murs, who has been supporting the world famous boy band on their This Life tour, was unable to make the gig after his flight from London was cancelled. He had been updating fans over the day on his Instagram story on his efforts to get to Glasgow. He posted a video from inside the plane before exiting and attempting to board another flight. Eventually, he posted on social media that it wasn't going to happen. ""So sorry to everyone at the Take That show tonight in Glasgow, unfortunately I won't be there,"" the 39-year-old said on X. ""Don't think I've ever missed a gig before, am so annoyed!"" He was taking a car to ensure he made the Saturday and Sunday shows at the Ovo Hydro. After Glasgow, Take That are heading to Manchester for their next gigs. But their five dates next week will now be held at the AO Arena, after they were forced to move from the troubled Co-op Live arena amid a series of ""technical issues""."

Here's how they enjoy Tokyo's hottest live music, from buskers in Shibuya to concerts at Nippon Budokan. Vibrant subcultures and the second largest music market in the world make Tokyo a bucket list-worthy ""music destination""; delighting locals and visitors alike with its sheer diversity. We spoke with chart-topping J-pop sensation YOASOBI, aka Vocaloid music producer Ayase and singer Ikura , to get a feel for the city’s musical landscape. The SpeciaList Comprised of composer Ayase and vocalist Ikura, YOASOBI is a record-breaking J-pop duo taking over global music charts with singles such as Idol and The Brave. Originally drawing musical inspiration from fiction published on Monogatary.com, the pair are renowned for transforming written works into sonically innovative chart-toppers. Their hit Idol surged as the first song performed in Japanese to top Billboard’s Global Excl. US chart. ""Given that Tokyo is the capital and the biggest city in Japan, a lot of the creative talent and artists gather [here] to explore cutting-edge sounds and music,"" says Ayase, whose wildly popular collaborations with Ikura were originally based on short stories from Monogatary.com ; Sony Music Entertainment Japan 's social network for creative artists. ""A lot of the trends and sounds are set in Tokyo; that’s why the music scene is so high level."" Long before YOASOBI became internationally famous, Tokyo eclectic musical culture and venues allowed them to perfect their unique, literary-inspired sound. ""In Japan and Tokyo, there's a lot of individuality, so whether you go to the clubs or live houses or maybe [to] a specific venue to see an artist you like, there's not just one space where all that culture is packed into,"" says Ayase. Discovering Tokyo is an endless journey of exploration, with something to offer to every music enthusiast, from nostalgia-fueled city pop to experimental sounds. Here are Ayase and Ikura's favourite ways to experience Tokyo's contemporary music scene. Frenetically dynamic, Shibuya has become one of Tokyo's most popular destinations. Spanning 15 sq km and brimming with venues that cater to different music crowds, the district attracts everyone from curious passersby enjoying street performances to connoisseurs exploring the live music scene. Shibuya is the epicentre of trends and a mandatory stop for visitors, says Ayase. He recommends first-time travellers and those who want to discover Tokyo’s music offerings start off by exploring the district on foot. ""Shibuya is where you can experience the hottest trends in terms of music,"" he says. ""It centres around the younger generation so they drive a lot of the culture, whether it’s fashion, the clubbing scene or music. The town is very lively so [...] you’re going to hear music almost 24/7… You can walk in the city and see these huge LED billboards where a lot of artists are promoting their latest work and teasing their music videos."" Ikura encourages visitors to pay attention to buskers in the area. ""At the corner of the Shibuya Scramble Crossing , in front of Tsutaya , you can find street musicians playing,"" she says. A landmark of Shibuya's world-famous intersection, the Tsutaya book store is located right in front of the Shibuya JR [train] Station and is, as Ikura explains, ""just two steps away from the Hachiko [dog] statue"". Address: 2 Dogenzaka, Shibuya-ku, 150-0043 Tokyo Instagram: @city_shibuya_official Perhaps no other place on the planet flaunts the diversity of Tokyo’s live music landscape quite so well as ""live houses"" – venues of varied sizes and aesthetics that host gigs every night. And there’s no shortage of options; all acts and musical genres, from jazz to heavy metal, find a place in the eclectic Tokyo scene. A superb example is Shibuya Gee ge , an unassuming and intimate venue with a motley selection of show listings. The live house, which is slated to celebrate its 14th anniversary in September 2024, is equipped with a grand piano and a high-quality audio system often commended by local artists. Before rising to global stardom, Ikura occassionally performed here and still recommends it without a second thought. ""You can find good singer-songwriters playing at this venue,"" she says. Website: http://www.gee-ge.net/ Address: 3−10 4 階 , Udagawacho, Shibuya City, 150-0042 Tokyo Phone: +81 3-6416-3468 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/gee_ge.official/ The next stop on YOASOBI's list is the Nippon Budokan . Originally conceived as a martial arts hall for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics , Budokan is an octagonal arena-style venue steeped in music history. ""We have a lot of sentiment and memories there because it's a very famous venue where the top artists from Japan perform,"" says Ikura. The storied venue has witnessed legendary moments of music history over the years. In 1966, the arena welcomed The Beatles for a five-date concert, establishing a rock 'n roll tradition perpetuated by groups such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Cheap Trick . Tip Keeping up with music acts and events in Tokyo is not always an easy feat. Ayase’s tip: make the internet your ally. ""The entire town has a lot of music playing all the time so you can go to the clubs or any type of live house to listen to bands, pop, EDM,"" he says. ""If you look at social media, you can find all kinds of events and performances that are ongoing. So go to Shibuya, have some drinks, have some fun, look up events online and attend."" Budokan's reputation as one of Japan's most iconic concert halls grew exponentially over the years as stars sold out concerts and recorded critically acclaimed live albums . Nowadays, the venue remains a coveted and prestigious location for international and local acts. ""Performing there is usually the dream of upcoming artists and it was our dream as well,"" Ikura says. ""YOASOBI became really active in the middle of the Covid-19 [pandemic] so we couldn’t do a lot of performances in front of an audience. In December 2021, we got to perform in the Budokan for the first time with a live audience and it was such a memorable experience for us to be performing in the same venue where [emblematic] artists have performed.""

Located in Western Tokyo, about 20km from Shibuya, this enchanting spot is Ikura’s recommendation for outdoor music performances. ""When I was still a student, I used to hang out a lot in the area of Kichijoji. I spent a better part of my teen years there, more specifically, in a park called Inokashira Park,"" she says. ""I used to perform on the street back when I was really young. That experience of performing in front of the public put me on the path of [becoming] an artist and my music-writing and music-making career originated there. Kichijoji and that park are very intimate place for me in terms of my musical history."" Inokashira Park, however, is not only relevant to Ikura’s personal story; the park has served as the filming location of music-centered movies such as Parks , starring Mei Nagano , and hosts outdoor concerts and music festivals every year. Address: 1-18-31, Gotenyama, Musashino-shi, Tokyo  Recognised as the home of counterculture movements in Tokyo, the Koenji neighbourhood reflects Tokyo’s edgy and unconventional spirit, and is littered with vintage shops, music bars and live houses. In fact, Koenji is known as the birthplace of the punk movement in Japan. ""There’s a lot of culture there between actors, actresses, bands, artists, creatives and even comedians,"" says Ayase of the creative hub, just two metro stops from Shibuya. The artistic offerings in Koenji are varied, ranging from vintage record stores to indie rock and punk basement bars. However, Ayase, who has long been part of the neighbourhood’s artistic community, recommends walking around the Koenji Station for the most authentic experience. ""There are a lot of musicians playing their songs in this station area,"" he says. ""I used to be in a [rock] band and we moved to Tokyo with the dream to perform and make it big one day. The first place I arrived in Tokyo was Koenji. It was a very fun experience for me, looking back. I think [about] it as a big milestone for my musical career."" Address: 4 Chome-48-2 Koenjiminami, Suginami City, Tokyo 166-0003 You can't talk about Tokyo’s contemporary music scene without mentioning its nightlife and gig culture. ""I think there’s a very strong club culture in Shibuya so whether [you’re looking for] a hip hop-type of vibe or an EDM type of vibe, you can find a lot of those clubs in this area in Shibuya called Dogenzaka ,"" says Ayase. With a slew of entertainment spaces dedicated to different genres, Dogenzaka Street is a go-to for whoever wants to lose themselves to the beat. Options are endless and cater to different tastes, but Ayase mentions a specific Shibuya institution that has been open since 1996, pioneering the ""all music-genres"" scene and accommodating different music acts from DJs to rappers. "" Club Asia , specifically is a good example,"" he says. ""But there’s also a lot of live houses that you can attend close to the Shibuya Station. There’s definitely a lot of options.""

About 600 people were deported from the island in 1942 and taken to the internment camp in Bad Wurzach in Germany. Some of the internees, who were children when they were deported, attended the opening of the ‘Life Behind Barbed Wire’ exhibition at Jersey Arts Centre. Organisers wanted to help others understand what people went through between 1942 and 1945 in the internment camp. Francelise Davidson was three when she was taken with her family to Bad Wurzach. She was one of about 200 children who were taken and Ms Davidson said she found “a photo of my sister when I was four years old and she was five years old” and that was “quite emotional”. “My father had 24 hours to clear the house and get us on the first ship out,” she added. Ms Davidson said the exhibition “shows how people came together” and it has been “put on beautifully”. Lola Garvin is the chairman of the St Helier and Bad Wurzach Twinning Committee and also a former internee. She helped bring the exhibition over from Germany where it was originally displayed. Ms Garvin said seeing the photos brought back memories of the “hardships and the difficult times”. She added a photo of her old dormitory was very moving because she had shared it “with 30 mothers and children with a stove in the middle and we lived there 24 hours a day”. The exhibit was curated by Gisela Rothenhausler of the Bad Wurzach Partnerschaft Committee. She said the opening was “very overwhelming for some people seeing these images again” and she “didn't expect so many people to turn up”. Ms Rothenhausler added the exhibition showed pictures internees made of “everyday life or sports being played”. She said she hoped it would reveal a side of the internment camp “people haven’t seen before”. Follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

Hamas said its delegation was travelling in a ""positive spirit"" after studying the latest truce proposal. ""We are determined to secure an agreement in a way that fulfils Palestinians' demands,"" it said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""taking the ceasefire should be a no-brainer"" for the militant group. Hamas's negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks - brokered by Egypt and Qatar - that would temporarily pause Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. In a statement released last night, Hamas said it wanted to ""mature"" the agreement on the table, which suggests there are areas where the two sides still disagree. The main issue appears to involve whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. Hamas is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel is reluctant to agree while the group remains active in Gaza. It's thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted there will be a fresh military ground operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, even if a deal is agreed. Israeli media reported on Saturday that his position remained unchanged despite the latest round of talks. But the US - Israel's biggest diplomatic and military ally - is reluctant to back a new offensive that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip. Addressing the prospects of a truce on Saturday, minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said: ""An official response to the outline has not yet been received. When accepted - the war management cabinet will meet and discuss it. Until then, I suggest to the 'political sources' and all decision-makers to wait for official updates, to act calmly and not to get into hysteria for political reasons."" The Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Williams Burns, has travelled to Cairo to help broker the latest talks, according to two US officials who spoke to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News. Mr Blinken has also been a key figure in the negotiations, and visited Israel again this week to meet Mr Netanyahu. Speaking on Friday in Arizona, Mr Blinken said ""the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire was Hamas"". So far, ceasefire talks have continued for months without a breakthrough. There hasn't been a pause in fighting or a release of hostages since the end of November. There have been moments in that time where a new agreement has seemed imminent, but a deal has fallen apart before it could be signed. Even in this latest round of discussions, caution is needed. A source familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations remained complex, and any breakthrough could still take several days. A source told the Washington Post that the US had urged Qatar to expel Hamas's political leadership, if the group continued to reject a ceasefire. On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Democracy Square in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages. Relatives of the hostages also gathered at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv to urge the government to make a deal. Some accused Mr Netanyahu of trying to undermine a proposed truce, and others called for an end to the war. Ayala Metzger, daughter-in-law of 80-year-old hostage Yoram, said the government must agree to end the war if that is the price for the release of the hostages. The war began after Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups attacked villages and military bases in southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. During the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, 34,654 Palestinians have been killed and 77,908 wounded, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry."

Another person was killed in a second strike on a residential area, he added. Attacks on Kharkiv, the closest big city to the Russian border, have been intensifying in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials have said the city might be the target of a future Russian offensive. ""This attack on peaceful residents of Kharkiv once again proves that Russia is a terrorist state,"" Mr Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app after the first attack. At least 11 people were injured by the attack in the residential Shevchenkivskyi district, according to the local prosecutor's office. It said high-rise buildings, administrative buildings, dormitories, a kindergarten, shops, cafes and cars were damaged. Unverified photos published by Ukrainian police showed rescuers at the scene, with damaged and burning buildings visible. Local police said Moscow fired two missiles, followed by ""repeated shelling"", and then drones which attacked during the rescue operations. Volodymyr Tymoshko, of the local police force, said on social media: ""When all relevant services were working at the site of the missile hit, enemy drones arrived."" Ukraine's second-largest city has suffered extensive damage from months of Russian bombardment since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Polish authorities said fighter jets had been scrambled in response to the latest missile attacks on Ukraine. Authorities in Kyiv said air defences had been activated to repel an attack on the capital. Ukraine's military said its air defences destroyed 28 of 32 drones and three of six missiles launched by Russia. On Thursday, Russian forces attacked Kharkiv with drones, leaving at least four dead, according to Ukrainian officials. And on Friday, authorities said four people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia."

The exhibition interrogates the term ""lady amateur"", which was often used in contrast to the “professional” artist title usually reserved for males. Melissa Gustin, curator of British Art, said the exhibition champions work by female artists determined to fulfil their creativity but who were often mocked by the establishment. She said: ""They've come from being laughed at at every tea table, as Thomas Gainsborough said, to being some of the most recognised women and artists in the world."" She said: ""This exhibition shows how women landscape painters used their art to express their individual gazes, representing multiple viewpoints along the way. “They explored and interrogated the landscape around them, developing important networks and experimenting with new mediums and techniques in the process."" Elizabeth Campbell, whose watercolours recording her tour through the Alps were painted between 1818 and 1827, is among the relatively unknown artists featured in the exhibition. Ms Gustin said the artist, from Yorkshire, was radical for her time. ""She married a Scottish soldier, and after he died in the Napoleonic Wars... she took her young daughter, Thomasina, off to the Continent and spent the next 20 or 30 years essentially having adventures,"" she said. Ms Gustin said she did everything from ""mountain climbing to speaking new languages and meeting new people and painting everything along her way"". ""They include a document of her trip over Mont Blanc,"" she said. ""They were the first women to do this and they did it in corsets and hoop skirts, painting the whole way."" Work from decorated artist Dame Ethel Walker (1861-1951) is also included in the display. She exhibited at the Venice Biennale several times, was elected to the Royal Academy, and was given a damehood for her services to the arts in 1943. She wanted to be known as an artist, not a female artist, Ms Gustin said. ""She felt the discussion around women artists from male artists was counter-productive, and that what really mattered was the quality of someone's painting or sculpture,"" she said. She said she felt ""that they should not be focused on the person's gender but on how well they actually painted and if they had originality and talent"". Work from Sheila Fell (1931-1979) is also on show. The Cumbria artist preferred the local views to anywhere else even though she travelled in Europe, Ms Gustin said. ""She loved the place she came from in Cumbria and painted that rather than anything else. ""She visited Greece, she visited France and she found them uninspiring compared to Aspatria and the land that she'd grown up in,"" she added. The exhibition runs until 18 August.

politics,politics,Neutral,"['MoD', 'The Public and Commercial Services Union', 'MoD', 'MoD', 'Labour', 'Labour']",Jeremy Hunt defends civil service job cuts to increase defence spending,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68893859,2024-04-25,0.12061816995443975,Normal,False,Unsustainable mining,"Jeremy Hunt has defended plans to slash civil service jobs to increase defence spending and Ukraine aid, during a surprise trip to Kyiv. The chancellor said cutting public services will cost ""a great deal less"" compared to allowing Russia to succeed. The government has pledged to increase UK military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2030. Mr Hunt confirmed the increase will cost an extra £20bn, which unions claim will be funded by cutting 70,000 jobs. Downing Street said the plans would be funded through existing commitments to reduce the civil service headcount to pre-Covid levels, and giving the ministry of defence (MoD) a share of an already-announced increase in government research spending. The Public and Commercial Services Union said cutting civil servants' jobs to pay for higher defence spending would lead to longer waiting lists for new passports, driving tests and driving licence. The announcement comes after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the UK would provide an additional £500m for Ukraine this year, on top of £2.5bn already allocated. Mr Sunak added that the UK could continue to provide ""at least the current level of military support to Ukraine for every year it is needed"". Speaking in Kyiv after a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Hunt said he hope the increased funding would be ""a turning point in this war"". ""We think other European countries will follow us and that will send a message to Putin that he is not going to succeed,"" Mr Hunt said. The ""UK has a special role"" in supporting the Ukraine war effort, because ""we have the largest defence budget in Europe,"" he added. ""I'm here because if we want to restore peace in Europe, we must make sure that Putin does not succeed with his evil war of aggression right here in Ukraine,"" he said. On shrinking the civil service to pay for defence spending and Ukraine aid, he said: ""This is a choice but the choice we are making is to invest in European security and defence. ""And if we stop Putin doing what he is trying to do in Ukraine, in the end, it will cost all of us a great deal less. ""I think it is reasonable to reduce the civil service to the size it was pre-Covid, and I'm confident we can do that with more efficient delivery of public services."" Mr Hunt confirmed the spending, which will gradually increase over the next six years, would be £20bn more than if spending stayed at its current level of 2.3% of GDP. The additional funding will also help resource MoD programmes already under way - such as an order for new naval frigates, the development of a new fighter jet, and the modernisation of Britain's nuclear weapons systems. These programmes are proving to be very expensive and the MoD has been struggling to make ends meet on its existing resources. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said on Tuesday his party ""wants to see a fully funded plan"" to reach this level. But the Tories had ""shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted on defence"", he added. He said Labour would review resources for the armed forces within a year of taking office, if it wins the general election later this year."

Three artists from Creative Debuts painted the mural in Ilford, east London, in March. It depicts four reporters and photographers standing before a pile of rubble in Gaza, based on a photograph taken by photographer Suhail Nassar. An Israeli legal support group has argued it could worsen tensions in London's multi-ethnic communities. The mural has the words ""Heroes of Palestine"" written above the journalists' heads and, further down the road, the words ""all eyes on Gaza"" have also been painted over a Palestinian flag. Alia Shaikh, who owns and lives in the home the mural was painted on, said she personally commissioned the piece after feeling ""powerless"" about the ongoing Israel-Gaza war. She said: ""I think it's important for young children to have good role models. ""They're heroes. Without them, we'd have no idea what's happening."" She said Redbridge Council had visited her but she was resolute the mural would stay, adding she had been widely supported by the community, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. She explained: ""We've not broken any laws. We shouldn't be bullied into doing something and stand up for what we believe."" A group called UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLI) says that Redbridge is one of a number of councils including Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Worcester and Lambeth with murals, signs or artwork that ""promotes divisiveness"", and asked Redbridge Council to wash it off. In a statement, the group's director, Caroline Turner, said: ""Councils are legally required to have regard to the need to foster good relations between different religious and ethnic communities. ""The murals do not foster good relations between different communities and have proved divisive in the locations where they have been painted. Many have already been defaced."" Similar murals in Shoreditch and Hackney, depicting journalists and medics, have been sprayed over with Stars of David and messages condemning Hamas, the group that governs Gaza. Ms Turner added: ""Councils have powers to remove these murals and should do so as a priority where the murals promote one side of the current war, in view of their impact on community cohesion."" Creative Debuts has made various other murals in support of Gaza across London and in other cities, as well as for other campaigns. Founder Calum Hall said the Ilford mural commemorated journalists showing ""incredible resilience and bravery"" in the face of ""unspeakable horror"". He said the group was ""not trying to antagonise"" anyone, adding: ""It's a pretty neutral and uncontroversial way of showing solidarity and raising awareness. It's unfathomable to take issue with a painting of a doctor or a journalist."" ""We need to have a look at what's going on and the wider context around it. ""The enemy is not a doctor, it is not a journalist - they are human beings in impossible situations, trying to survive and help people. ""It would be totally different if we were painting Hamas battalions on the side of a wall."" UK Lawyers for Israel argues the Ilford mural's placement contravenes section 224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which prohibits unregulated adverts. Ms Turner added the mural was ""in effect an advertisement, advertising the Palestinian cause"" and that it breached the planning act ""since it had been displayed without the consent of the local authority"". Mr Hall said this was ""nonsense,"" arguing: ""It's an artwork; it's quite obviously not an advert."" He added there would be a ""chilling effect on street art and visual campaigning"" if Redbridge Council upheld the charge that the mural constituted an advert. A spokesperson for Redbridge Council told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that it was reviewing the situation but declined to comment further.

Tapestry owns handbag makers including Coach and Kate Spade, while Capri's brands include Michael Kors. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said if allowed, ""the deal would eliminate direct head-to-head competition between Tapestry’s and Capri’s brands"". In response Tapestry said ""the FTC fundamentally misunderstands both the marketplace and the way in which consumers shop"". Together, the firms employ about 33,000 staff globally but the FTC argued the deal could reduce wages and their benefits. Coach and Kate Spade are known for what their parent firm calls ""accessible luxury"" handbags - quality leather and craftsmanship products at affordable prices. Tapestry offered to buy Capri in August, hoping to create a US fashion giant that could compete against bigger European rivals such as Chanel, Hermes and Louis Vuitton parent LVMH. The FTC requested more information on the deal in November. Announcing its decision to take legal action , the FTC said the deal would give Tapestry a dominant share of the market. Tapestry said in a statement that ""in bringing this case, the FTC has chosen to ignore the reality of today’s dynamic and expanding $200 billion global luxury industry"". Capri, which also owns Versace and Jimmy Choo, said ""this transaction will not limit, reduce, or constrain competition"" as the two firms ""operate in the fiercely competitive and highly fragmented global luxury industry"". It is unusual for the US regulator to try to block a high-end fashion merger. But in December, authorities issued new merger guidelines to encourage fair, open and competitive markets. By using a new tactic under the guidelines, the FTC has argued that the merger of Tapestry and Capri would directly affect hourly workers who may lose out on higher wages due to reduced competition for employees. Earlier this month, the companies received regulatory clearance for the deal from the European Union and Japan. The two companies need to close the deal by 10 August."

The composer is best known for writing the music to Land of Hope and Glory.  The North Craven Building Preservation Trust aims to celebrate the inspiration Elgar drew from Settle and the Yorkshire Dales. It hopes to create a museum and gallery in a Grade II listed building, Dr Buck's House, which was a Natwest Bank until 2017. The building was previously owned by Dr Charles W Buck, a local GP and close friend of the composer. A plaque on the building already commemorates Elgar's association with Settle. Planning documents state that the condition of the architecturally significant building will continue to deteriorate without intervention. They go on to say that “the proposals seek to find the least obtrusive, most financially viable, and sustainable solutions to halting the decay and bringing the building back into use"". Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934) is best known for composing the music for the Land of Hope and Glory, which closes the annual Last Night of the Proms. His other popular works include Enigma Variations, the Serenade For Strings, and his concertos for violin and cello. Elgar also opened Britain's first HMV store on Oxford Street in London in July 1921. North Yorkshire Council will decide on the museum plans at a later date.

Mr Parker defeated Tory incumbent Andy Street, who had held the office for seven years and was seeking a third term, by just 1,508 votes, in a shock loss for the Conservatives. However, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket, won 69,621 votes, diminishing Labour's lead in some of its typical stronghold areas. BBC analysis has shown Labour's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections this week. In 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one in five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested. Speaking on BBC Politics Midlands after his electoral win, Richard Parker addressed voters' concerns about Gaza. ""It's a very important point and it matters to this region,"" he said. ""I've been out speaking and listening to many of our inner city communities, including the Muslim community. ""I understand their concerns, I understand how important this issue is to them and I'm committed to working with our council leaders, our councillors, our MPs in the region and with the Labour Party nationally to start to rebuild the trust we've lost with the Muslim community. ""I'm hoping if we do that and we demonstrate to them we do care and we understand their concerns, we can rebuild that trust and we can win them back to Labour."" Labour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position. Its initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year. Speaking in Birmingham after Mr Parker's win, Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed Labour voters who turned away from the party over its stance on Gaza. ""I say directly to those who may have voted Labour in the past, but felt on this occasion they couldn't, that across the West Midlands we are a proud and diverse community,""  Mr Starmer said. ""I have heard you, I have listened, and I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future."" Labour's campaign chief and Wolverhampton MP Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: ""I understand why people have got strong feelings about this issue, thousands of people have been killed. ""There’s a great impulse to help people that are in a terrible situation, that’s something that we share. ""The better life that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares. If we’re fortunate enough to be elected at the general election, its a very high foreign policy priority for the Labour Party. ""Two things have guided us since 7 October last year, the first was defending Israel’s right to defend itself after that atrocity and that remains part of our position and the second is working to get a better future for the Palestinian people, both of those things will guide our position going forward."" When asked whether the party’s stance on the issue will have an impact in a general election, he replied: ""I do acknowledge that in some parts of the country that was the case and there will be some people who may have voted Labour in the past that haven’t in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we’ll work to get people’s support back. ""Overall I do have to stress, these were tremendous local election results, a tremendous by-election and a set of Mayoral elections that went beyond the expectations that we had."" On BBC Politics Midlands, Mr Parker also discussed the mayoral results and what it meant for Labour in the next general election. ""It was an emotional rollercoaster. I'd actually only written a losing speech,"" the new mayor said. ""I had a great platform for my campaign and that was provided by the great work the Labour Party have done under Keir Starmer's leadership.

Initially only a small proportion of logged-in UK users will see an AI-generated ""overview"" at the top of some search results. While Google is the most popular search engine, Microsoft's rival Bing already integrates its Copilot AI. But some publishers worry AI answers may reduce visits to their sites. They fear longer chatbot-style responses will satisfy users' curiosity without having to visit their websites, while AI answers will also contain fewer links and ads. The ""Search Generative Experience"" - as Google dubs the feature - has been available for nearly a year in the US, but only to users who signed up via Google Labs. It said the UK experiment will involve a ""small slice"" of UK search traffic, selected from logged-in users. It comes as a front-page report in the Financial Times suggested that the firm was considering offering subscriptions for some premium AI search features in the future. Google denied it was ""working on or considering an ad-free search experience"". Hema Budaraju, who helps drive Google's generative AI efforts in search, told the BBC its new search results will still display links and ads. She said it was a ""priority"" to continue to send traffic to creators, and claimed AI-powered search results were ""actually showing more links to a wider range of sources"". The ""proof was in the pudding"", she said, adding that so far users were clicking on an increased range of sources too. The AI-generated ""overview"" will be shown only in response to certain queries, where current trials have suggested they were helpful. Ms Budaraju said a search for ""how to get marks off painted walls"" is one example that people have found useful. But Google is aware of the risk, common to AI systems, that they can sometimes generate content that is harmful, offensive, display racial or gender bias, or factually wrong. Ms Budaraju said the tech giant wanted to maintain ""information quality"", and it would ""put in a lot of care and attention to do this in a responsible way"". As a result, she said Google chose to make answers less fluent and more constrained, focusing instead on accuracy. For example, it is not generating AI answers to all queries, particularly where there aren't sufficient high quality sources of information. Users can send feedback if they encounter problems with the results - and Google is clear this is an experiment. ""We will find issues of bias and safety,"" she said, ""but the commitment is to find [these] and then invest in making it better"". The firm says US users have responded positively so far, but if the trial is successful and AI generated search answers are eventually used by billions of people, that may bring further challenges. For example, researchers have pointed to the large amounts of electricity required to power the computing that powers big AI systems. That is energy use that comes at an environmental price."

It puts US President Joe Biden in a new kind of domestic political bind. He is caught between a left flank that is demanding peace, and Americans concerned that the unrest is disrupting university education and posing a threat to civil order. A message scrawled on a tent at a refugee camp in Rafah, the beleaguered southern Gaza Strip city, captured exactly how far word of recent US campus protests has travelled. “Thank you students for Columbia,” it read. “Thank you. Thank You. Thank you.” Other tents had similar messages of gratitude and solidarity, captured in video and photographs by American journalists on the scene. Over the past several weeks, police have arrested more than 2,000 protesters on dozens of college campuses across the US. Late Tuesday night at the University of California Los Angeles, a masked pro-Israeli group assaulted a pro-Palestinian student protest camp , before officers were called to the campus. Classes were cancelled. On Thursday, California police cleared the pro-Palestinian encampment. A similar scene played out at Columbia University, as New York City police in riot gear forcibly removed protesters who had barricaded themselves into an academic building and cleared that college's pro-Palestinian camp. The unrest comes at a tense moment in the Gaza War. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) appear to be preparing for a massive military operation in Rafah, a refuge for more than a million civilians. The Israelis have said it is the last redoubt of Hamas forces. Meanwhile, the US is pushing the Israelis and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire that would last weeks and include the release of some Hamas-held Israeli hostages, an increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the return of Palestinians to the northern part of the territory, where the Israeli incursion began months ago. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently concluded his seventh trip to the region since the start of hostilities, meeting with Arab leaders and the Israelis in a last-ditch attempt to forestall a Rafah operation that observers say is likely to cause a humanitarian disaster. At a State Department briefing on Thursday, spokesman Matt Miller said that the Israelis had made significant concessions in recent negotiations – agreeing to conditions that Hamas had said were necessary to reach a deal. “Every day that goes by without a ceasefire right now is on Hamas,” he said. “They are the ones that are holding up an answer to this proposal, and they are the ones that are holding up an immediate ceasefire.” On Friday, a Hamas leader said the group was reviewing the latest proposal in a “positive spirit”, and a delegation was sent to Cairo for ceasefire talks on Saturday. Any sign of progress will be welcome news for a Biden administration that is coming under increasing pressure to stop – at least temporarily – the civilian bloodshed and suffering in Gaza. In his press briefing, Mr Miller was dismissive of the impact of American campus protests on US efforts, but he acknowledged that it was difficult to avoid US media coverage of the unrest even overseas, and that the topic came up in conversation during Mr Blinken’s Middle East trip. Official American dismissiveness aside, the political pressure on Biden because of these protests is growing. For months, the president has been resisting calls from factions within the Democratic left to back away from his vocal support for Israel. He’s done this despite clear political risk, as more liberal voters – particularly the young and people of colour, who make up a key part of his electoral coalition – have grown increasingly critical of what they view as a policy that is tolerant, if not supportive, of aggressive Israeli actions in Gaza. Polls show Mr Biden is in a tough fight for re-election in November, where even a slight softening of support in battleground states could be the difference between victory and another four years of Donald Trump in the White House. “Because of the razor-thin margins in some places like Wisconsin and Michigan that are going to be pivotal in the election, I think it creates more potential for the Gaza War to matter,” says Jessica Weeks, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, which has been the site of pro-Palestinian encampments and subsequent police arrests. At least so far, that seems to be a risk Mr Biden is willing to take. Vocal objections about the administration’s support of Israel from the president’s left flank have been a recurring theme in the months since Israel’s invasion began. What’s new – and potentially more complicating – is the pressure now coming from right and centre, as campus unrest has dominated the headlines. Republicans, sensing vulnerability, have gone on the attack, claiming Biden is unable to maintain law and order and is turning a blind eye to antisemitism. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called protesters “raging lunatics and Hamas sympathisers” at a Wisconsin rally on Wednesday night. “I say remove the encampments immediately, vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students who want a safe place from which to learn,” he said. The following morning, after several nights of police crackdown on demonstrators, Mr Biden made a hastily scheduled appearance at the White House to condemn what he said was the lawlessness of some protests  – including vandalism, trespassing and disruption of university activities. “We are a civil society, and order must prevail,” he said. US elections have not traditionally been decided on issues of foreign policy unless American soldiers are dying overseas, but issues of law and order and domestic tranquillity can be more salient – particularly to the kind of middle-class American voters who live in college towns or send their children to prestigious universities. It could explain why Mr Biden, in his Thursday remarks, defended American free speech rights but spent most of his time warning protesters of the consequences of their actions.  When the president finished his prepared remarks and turned to leave the room, a reporter asked if the protests had made him reconsider any of his Mideast policies. The president’s one-word answer: No. It may not be that easy. “Certainly it would not be politically wise for the president to say that he is making decisions that affect US national security based on the opinions of 19-year-old students,” says Ms Weeks. There is no mistaking the political realities of Mr Biden’s situation, however – and the possibility of escalation if ceasefire talks crumble and a bloody Israeli campaign in Rafah begins. With college graduation season approaching, a new round of highly visible protests could be on the horizon. In two weeks, the president is scheduled to speak at Atlanta’s Morehouse College, a historically black university where administrators are already expressing concern about campus security. And in August, Democrats will gather in Chicago for their party convention to formally renominate Mr Biden for the presidency – which could become a national focal point of intense protests not seen since the 1968 Democrat convention in the same city during the height of the Vietnam War. A ceasefire may buy the Biden White House some breathing room. But it may take the kind of permanent peace that has proven so elusive to remove the Gaza War as a potent political threat to the president."

It comes amid ongoing attempts to try to reach an agreement for a ceasefire and hostage releases. But at a meeting of hostages' relatives, Mr Netanyahu said he would invade ""with or without"" a deal. His comments follow renewed warnings by the US against a Rafah invasion unless civilians were properly protected. In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu on Sunday, US President Joe Biden ""reiterated his clear position"" on Rafah, a White House statement said. Mr Biden has previously described an invasion of Rafah as a ""red line"". On Tuesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said an assault on Rafah would be an ""unbearable escalation"", appealing for ""all those with influence over Israel to do everything in their power to prevent it"". More than half of Gaza's 2.5m population is in Rafah, having fled there to escape fighting in other parts of the territory. Conditions in the overcrowded city are dire, and displaced people there have spoken of a lack of food, water and medication. The West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Monday that an invasion of Rafah would be the ""biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history"". Israeli sources told the Reuters news agency on Monday that plans to attack Rafah would be shelved in favour of a ""sustained period of calm"" if a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israeli was reached. Days earlier, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Channel 12 television that ""if there will be a deal, we will suspend the [Rafah] operation"". But on Tuesday Mr Netanyahu insisted that the war would continue until Israel had achieved all of its objectives in Rafah. ""The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question,"" he said. ""We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory,"" according to a statement issued by Mr Netanyahu's office. It said the families urged the prime minister and his national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, to continue the war and ignore mounting international pressure. Many hostage families however have publicly demonstrated for the government to agree to a deal to return their loved ones at any cost. About 130 hostages from among 253 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued. Indirect talks have been at an impasse for weeks, although the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said on Monday that he hoped Hamas would accept what he has called Israel's ""extraordinarily generous offer"" for a truce. Meanwhile the head of the UN's refugee organisation has warned that the looming invasion was causing people in Rafah to live in a state of ""constant traumatic stress disorder"". ""People have not yet been asked to evacuate from Rafah, but there is a sense that if there is no deal this week that could happen,"" Philippe Lazzarini told reporters. ""My colleagues on the ground are describing constant state of trauma among the people."" Mr Netanyahu also denounced as ""a scandal on a historical scale"" recent reports, citing Israeli officials, that the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague could be preparing to issue arrest warrants for Israeli government leaders and military commanders on charges related to the war. ""I want to make one thing clear: no decision, neither in The Hague nor anywhere else, will harm our determination to achieve all the goals of the war,"" the prime minister said. ""Israel expects the leaders of the free world to come out strongly against this scandalous step, a step that will harm the self-defence capacity not only of the State of Israel, but of all democracies in the world."" There has been no announcement from ICC Prosecutor Karim Kahn KC. However, his office has been formally investigating alleged war crimes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip since June 2014, and Mr Khan has confirmed that the investigation will cover the 7 October attack and the ensuing war. Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding treaty, and Mr Netanyahu insisted that the ICC had ""no authority"" over the country. However, the ICC ruled in 2015 that it had jurisdiction because the Palestinians had ratified the treaty. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that the US - which has also not ratified the Rome Statute - did not believe the court has jurisdiction and did not support the investigation."

The Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean - the regions where Russia's military has been most active - have seen an increase in disruption to the Global Positioning System (GPS). This has left aircraft unable to receive GPS signals. In March, a RAF plane carrying Defence Secretary Grant Shapps had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The persistent disruption led Finland's flag carrier Finnair to suspend daily flights to Estonia's second largest city, Tartu, for a month, after two of its aircraft had to return to Helsinki due to GPS interference. Tartu Airport relies solely on GPS, unlike most larger airports which have alternative navigation systems that allow aircraft to land even if the signal is lost. Juho Sinkkonen, Finnair's vice-president for flight operations, told the BBC their aircraft encounter this issue daily. “Pilots are reporting cases actively, and we get more than 100 reports per month,” he said. However, Mr Sinkkonen said GPS interference is mainly a nuisance and carries few risks. This is because while an aircraft is in flight - i.e. before approaching and landing at an airport – it can normally use other navigation systems, so losing connection to GPS does not pose an immediate threat to its safety. According to Cyrille Rosay, a senior cybersecurity expert at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), while the problem existed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it is worsening. The EASA now clocks ""several thousand incidents"" per year, Mr Rosay said. When asked where the blame lies, officials from the Baltic states don’t hesitate. ""The source of interference is Russia,” Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the BBC. “We have proof that it is coming from Russia, and Russia is violating all the international agreements."" Mr Tsahkna said the sources of interference were located near the Russian cities of St Petersburg, Kaliningrad and Pskov. Online investigators agree, saying GPS jammers are likely located halfway between St Petersburg and Estonia and near the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea – where the RAF plane carrying Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was when its signal was jammed. Mr Tsahkna said that by jamming GPS signals, Russia was “violating our territories” and putting people and civilian airplanes in danger. “This is a violation of international agreements… And also I'm really sure that they know exactly what they're doing,"" he added. The BBC has contacted Russia's Ministry of Defence for comment. There have also been reports of maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea being affected by GPS interference. Jamming is the most widespread form of such meddling, but there have also been numerous instances of ""spoofing"", when legitimate signals are replaced with fake ones, indicating a false location. Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think tank, believes Russia is meddling with GPS for both offensive and defensive reasons. He says that while on the one hand Russia is testing ""its capabilities for immobilizing Europe completely in time of crisis"", it is also trying to protect itself from possible missile and drone attacks. ""Ukraine has already found ways around Russia's GPS jamming, using other navigational systems to carry out drone strikes deep into Russia. But of course that doesn't mean that Russia doesn't benefit from making sure that GPS simply does not work,"" Mr Giles told the BBC. The impact of GPS interference on Russia's own navigation is much less severe as it has its own sat-nav system, called GLONASS. Aircraft may have backup systems to work around GPS jamming, but Dana Goward, president of the US-based Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, which protects and improves GPS communication, says that meddling with signals still poses serious risks because ""all of our systems and society has been structured around precise GPS signals"". “When we take the GPS out, clearly to some degree the efficiency and the safety of the aviation system is going to go down,” he added. “People have to revert to old procedures that they're not quite so familiar with. There is going to be some harm, and we just hope it all stops before something bad happens.”"

The aid organisation said it has 276 trucks with eight million meals ready to enter through the Rafah crossing. ""Ultimately, we decided we must keep feeding,"" the charity said on Sunday. Earlier this month, the charity said a convoy leaving a warehouse was attacked by Israel killing seven and sparking an international outcry . The Israel Defense Forces admitted ""grave mistakes"" led to the fatal strike against the workers and dismissed two senior officers over the incident. In a statement on Sunday, WCK CEO Erin Gore said: ""The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. ""We are restarting our operation with the same energy, dignity, and focus on feeding as many people as possible."" The charity said it will also send trucks from Jordan and use the Ashdod Port, one of Israel's three main cargo ports, as well as build a third high production kitchen in Gaza. Speaking on the fatal airstrike, the charity said it was continuing to call for an impartial and international investigation into the deaths of the aid workers , which included three Britons, a Palestinian, Australian, Pole and US-Canadian citizen. ""While we have no concrete assurances, we continue to seek answers and advocate for change with the goal of better protecting WCK and all NGO workers serving selflessly in the worst humanitarian conditions,"" Ms Gore said. WCK is one of the main suppliers of desperately-needed aid into Gaza and says it has supplied more than 43 million meals in Gaza since the war started in October. Talking about the decision to resume operations, Ms Gore added: ""We decided that we must keep feeding, continuing our mission of showing up to provide food to people during the toughest of times."" In the space of four minutes on 1 April, the seven aid workers were killed when three missiles destroyed their cars one by one as they engaged in humanitarian work. The charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The IDF said a series of mistakes and miscommunications resulted in them being mistaken for Hamas operatives and targeted. Israel's military said a ""number of armed gunmen"" were in the vicinity of the convoy, but drone operators wrongly tracked cars carrying aid workers. The army apologised after admitting its soldiers did not follow protocols and were not given crucial information about the pre-approved aid mission. The WCK announcement comes as Israeli's military said the amount of aid going into Gaza will be ramped up in the coming days to help . Spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said in a statement: ""Food, water, medical supplies, shelter equipment and other aid - more of it is going into Gaza than ever before."" Israel is also working with US Central Command to construct a ""temporary maritime pier,"" which will allow ship-to-shore distribution, he added. The UN has warned that famine in the Gaza Strip is ""almost inevitable"" and children are starving to death. The current war began when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. Israel's subsequent campaign of aerial bombardment and ground operations in Gaza has killed 34,454 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there."

Alexander, who is representing the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest final on Saturday, grew up in Coleford in Gloucestershire and attended St John's Church of England Academy in the town. Ahead of his big performance, his teachers and current pupils at the school have reflected on the 33-year-old's career so far. Headteacher Joanne Peaper said staff ""always knew"" Alexander would go on to achieve big things. Alexander will perform his song ""Dizzy"" on Saturday, telling BBC Radio Gloucestershire that fans can expect a stage set that channels ""a post-apocalyptic locker room hurtling through space"". Nine-year-old Cameron, a current pupil at St John's, said this weekend will be his second time watching Eurovision. ""I listen to Dizzy quite a lot, it's a really good song,"" he said. ""I'm just quite shocked Olly has come from St John's. ""He's a good role model for all of the children at St John's right now, and it shows everyone what kids can do."" Other children said they will be tuning into Eurovision for the first time on Saturday to watch their school's famous ex-pupil perform. Katarina, eight, said it was ""shocking and amazing"" Alexander went to her school. ""I haven't even watched Eurovision yet, it's my first time but I'm really excited,"" she said. ""I play Dizzy every morning."" Class teacher Bernadette Lee said the children had been performing a medley of past Eurovision-winning songs in the build up to the event in Sweden. On Friday, they will tuck into a lunch inspired by this year's host country, consisting of Swedish meatballs and chips. ""We're decorating the school. It's just exciting for the children to see where someone at St John's can get to,"" Miss Lee said. ""I know teaching assistants have mentioned he was really good in school performances, and you could see the potential when he was at St John's."" Meanwhile, headteacher Joanne Peaper taught Alexander in the late 1990s and early 2000s. ""Olly was always one of our high achievers here at St John's, I taught him in a small English group,"" Ms Peaper said. ""It was while he was here that he started writing the lyrics to some of his very early music."" Ms Peaper said it was ""amazing"" that Alexander was representing the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. ""He's an excellent role model for all of our children here at St John's, I don't think they can actually believe someone who came here has achieved so much,"" she said.

Ahead of the ninth and final season of Bafta award-winning Inside No. 9, they have been reflecting on the show's history, and it wasn't always plain sailing. ""There have definitely been times where TV executives have thought we can't achieve certain things, but we've always proved them wrong,"" explains 56-year-old Pemberton. The pair haven't been afraid to experiment over the years, having produced an entirely silent episode, one all in iambic pentameter and now, in the final series, an episode filmed from a doorbell camera. Pemberton remembers one particular episode that bosses said would never work. ""We wrote an episode where all the characters were filmed talking into a fixed cameras, and to prove that it would work, we directed it ourselves. ""It actually ended up being one of the most gripping episodes we've ever made."" The episode, Thinking Out Loud, was praised highly by critics, and is often included in a roundup of best episodes. The i newspaper awarded the episode five stars and Sarah Hughes wrote that it ""pulled the rug from underneath its audience's feet"". The actors also said bosses weren't too sure about the format of the show when they first suggested it. ""When we first pitched the idea of an anthology format with individual stories lasting 30 minutes, it felt radical and wasn't very well received,"" explains Shearsmith. ""But now the tide has turned,"" he says, with the likes of Charlie Brooker's TV show Black Mirror proving successful, with seven nominations at this year's TV Baftas . In total, Pemberton and Shearsmith, who previously worked together on black comedy show The League of Gentleman, have written 55 standalone episodes of Inside No. 9 which can be watched in any order. The duo credit the success of the show to the variety of genres it crosses and the self-contained nature of each episode. Shearsmith says people are now more interested in commitment-free TV instead of drawn-out series with convoluted plots and too many characters. Pemberton describes the series as ""a box of chocolates and one of them is poison"". ""Sometimes you think the story is one genre and then halfway through it turns into another,"" he says. ""It does so well because you never know what you're going to get."" Previous series have been met with a positive response from critics, with the eighth one receiving five stars from Carol Midgley at The Times , who described it as ""exquisite"". And the pair definitely have pulled off some pretty impressive stunts over the years. In 2018 their Halloween special episode tricked viewers into thinking the live show had run into technical difficulties so an old episode would air instead. It turned out the technical difficulties were actually all planned and part of the spooky twist. But the problem with these kind of stunts and tricks is that they can only be done once. Regular Inside No. 9 viewers know to always think outside the box and expect the unexpected. So how do the writer and actor duo continuously manage to surprise viewers and deliver some killer (sometimes literally) twists? ""It has become increasingly difficult when people know to watch for red herrings, but we just try and focus on inventing good stories that will hook you quickly and only need 30 minutes to tell,"" says 54-year-old Shearsmith. ""The last 30 seconds of a show shouldn't be everything, it's actually all about the journey,"" he adds. ""The punchline of a joke doesn't make sense without the actual joke."" Pemberton says that it's important for the them to ""plant the seed early"" and says many viewers watch the episodes again, to see all the things they didn't spot the first time round. ""The answer is there all along,"" Pemberton tells the BBC. Speaking about the new series that airs on 8 May, there's not much that Shearsmith and Pemberton will give away. Both say they are ""very cagey"" when it comes to giving out information about the show, as part of its appeal is people don't know what to expect. Pemberton says the films and shows that have stuck with him the most over the years are the ones where he's gone in blind. ""I think if I had read a synopsis or seen a trailer before it would have ruined it for me."" However, the duo are particularly excited about the first episode of the final series, which will be the 50th episode in the anthology. Boo to a Goose sees an ensemble of British actors including Siobhan Finneran and Charlie Cooper all stuck on a late night train that has broken down. ""Every series we do an ensemble piece and we love it, because we put together our favourite actors, trap them together and see what happens,"" Pemberton says. As the series come to an end, the pair say they are feeling a mix of emotions. Shearsmith says he never thought the show would be as successful as it is and is ""delighted"" that it has run for so many years. ""It's not a sad thing that it's ending, in fact it feels like a poetic point to stop at series nine,"" Shearsmith adds. Having produced a range of episodes that are as shocking as they are disturbing, and comic as they are emotional, for Pemberton it feels like ""we have done a lifetime of work in just 10 years"" and both are very proud of leaving something behind."

The conservative firebrand filed the motion last month but held off on formally introducing it, which would require a vote on Mr Johnson's fate within two legislative days. At the time, she described her action as a warning to the Republican leader. Now she has followed through on that threat. Speaker Johnson put out a statement that her motion ""is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country"". Mr Johnson's support for a $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, approved by the House on 20 April, is partially responsible for Ms Greene forcing the vote. ""Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,"" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. ""He has proven it over and over again."" On Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives pledged to support Mr Johnson if his leadership was threatened - a show of gratitude for the speaker's co-operation on Ukraine aid, which was a priority for Democrats and President Joe Biden. Ms Greene called the Democratic pledge ""a warm hug and a big wet sloppy kiss"" for the speaker. Republican leaders, including former president Donald Trump, had reportedly pressured the Georgia congresswoman to back down from attempting to remove Mr Johnson, concerned that a Republican power struggle would harm the party's prospects in November's general election. Last October, Democrats voted with a handful of Republicans to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off three weeks of Republican discord as several top candidates failed to win the near-unanimous party support needed to secure the gavel. Mr Johnson ultimately prevailed -  in part because he was relatively unknown and had few connections to party leadership. But some Republicans, including Ms Greene, soured on him after he worked with Democrats to pass government funding legislation earlier this year. ""I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,"" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. ""Once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognise."" Two other Republicans in the House have said they will back Ms Greene's effort, which would be enough in the narrowly divided chamber to remove the speaker with Democratic help. Instead, the Democrats have said they will vote with pro-Johnson Republicans to ""table"" the motion, effectively killing. Ms Greene said she will introduce her motion to remove Mr Johnson next week."

The party's position on the Israel-Hamas war appears to have dented its support in Muslim areas in England's local elections. Labour's Ellie Reeves admitted it had ""a lot of work to do"" to rebuild support before the general election. She added this included ensuring voters ""understand our position"". In 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one-in-five residents identify as Muslim, Labour's share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested. It was a downside to an otherwise positive performance for Labour, which saw it gain more than 170 councillors to take control of eight councils. The potential impact on a general election is unclear, however, with some evidence the biggest drops in support are largely confined to areas where the party's support was already very strong. And there are signs that any adverse reaction was less prominent in London, where incumbent Labour mayor Sadiq Khan called for a ceasefire before the party leadership did. Labour's vote is up by three points on average in parts of London where more than 15% identify as Muslim, compared with 4.5% where the proportion is less than this. Labour called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict in February, after months of wrangling over its position. Its initial stance after the war began, in which it called for humanitarian pauses in the fighting, prompted Labour resignations in councils and from its frontbench last year. The decline in its vote share in areas with a big Muslim population appears to have been largely to the benefit of independent candidates standing in those areas. Ali Milani, chair of Labour Muslim Network, said Labour's positioning on Gaza ""is going to have a serious electoral consequence"". ""If I was a Labour MP in Bradford or Birmingham or Leicester or parts of London or Manchester I would be seriously concerned,"" he added. The Greens, who called for an ""immediate ceasefire"" just over a week after the war began , have also increased their share of the vote from 2021. Co-leader Carla Denyer said Labour's stance on the conflict had been the ""final straw"" for some Labour supporters who were already disappointed by policy U-turns in other areas. ""I have met many voters on doorsteps who brought it up proactively as an issue,"" she added. She also said ""part of the Muslim community switching their votes"" was also a factor in Newcastle, where the Greens gained their first-ever seats on the city council. On Sunday, recently re-elected Worthing Councillor and Momentum co-chair Hilary Schan resigned from Labour in order to support pro-Palestinian candidates from other parties - and she has joined journalist Owen Jones's We Deserve Better campaign. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Saturday, Ellie Reeves said: ""We know that we've got a great deal of work to do to rebuild trust with Muslim communities. ""I understand people's concerns about what's happening in Gaza. The loss of life there has been intolerable - that's why we have called an immediate ceasefire"". She added that ""a lot of listening needs to be done,"" and the party also needed to make sure voters ""understand our position"". Labour's national election co-ordinator Pat McFadden echoed her, telling the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the situation in the Middle East was a ""high foreign policy priority"" for Labour, if it was elected. ""The better lives that people want for the Palestinian people is something the Labour leadership shares,"" he said. He acknowledged that in some parts of the country, the conflict was proving a problem for Labour and said: ""There will be some people who maybe voted Labour in the past who haven't in the local elections because of this issue and where that's the case we'll work to get people's support back."" In the West Midlands mayoral race, independent candidate Akhmed Yakoob, who campaigned on Gaza, won over 69,000 votes. In Blackburn with Darwen, Labour lost council seats to independent candidates who quit the party over the leadership's Gaza stance. It also faced a surge from pro-Palestinian independents in Bradford, where the Labour council leader said Gaza had been a ""big issue"". The local party leader in Oldham said the conflict was a factor there, where Labour lost overall control of the council , but also blamed a wider unhappiness with ""mainstream parties"". George Galloway's strongly pro-Palestinian Workers Party of Britain won four seats - two in Rochdale, one in Calderdale and one in Manchester, where they ousted the Labour deputy leader of the council Luthfur Rahman. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

State department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win ""battlefield gains"" over Ukraine. The allegations, which US officials said were not an ""isolated"" incident, would contravene the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia signed. The Kremlin rejected the accusations, calling them ""baseless"". Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Russia stood by its obligations under the CWC, which prohibits states from developing or acquiring new weapons. Some 193 states have ratified the convention. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties. Chloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to ""dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions"" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). The chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW. The state department also said Moscow had regularly used ""riot control agents,"" or tear gas, during the war. President Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that President Vladimir Putin would pay a ""severe price"" if he did authorise the use of chemical weapons. ""We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,"" Mr Biden said. But there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict. And Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces had used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gases. The report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gases, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas. Three Russian bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme were sanctioned by the state department for their links to the production of chemical agents. Other firms that contributed to the government entities were also sanctioned. In 2017, the OPCW said Russia had destroyed the last of its Cold War-era stockpile of the weapons, as required under the CWC. But Moscow has since been accused of making incomplete declarations of its stockpile, according to the UK's House of Commons library. Since 2017, Russia has been accused of at least two chemical attacks - the Salisbury attack on a former Soviet intelligence officer and the 2020 poisoning of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The allegations come as part of a broader tranche of US sanctions which targeted 30 individuals, including three people officials say were involved in Navalny's death. The men are all officials at the Siberian prison colony where the opposition activist died earlier this year. Russia denies involvement in the opposition leader's death. Navalny's widow has accused President Putin of killing him. Meanwhile, Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have continued their steady advance ahead of Victory Day celebrations on 9 May - the holiday commemorating Soviet victory in World War Two. Much of the fighting has been taking place around Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the city of Avdiivka. It is thought Moscow wants to seize the town ahead of next week's celebrations. It comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's Security Service's (SBU) cyber-security department, Illya Vityuk, amid allegations that he tried to use his position to punish a Ukrainian journalist who had reported on allegations of corruption against him. The reporter was subsequently summoned to a military recruitment centre, prompting military chief Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi to launch an investigation. Elsewhere, Human Rights Watch - a non-governmental organisation - has called for a war crimes investigation after it unearthed evidence that Russian forces executed over a dozen surrendering Ukrainian troops. The events allegedly occurred between December 2023 and February 2024, the body said in a statement."

Gunning, who portrays a stalker called Martha in the word-of-mouth hit, previously played Sian James in the 2014 film Pride. Sian was the wife of a striking miner who went on to become the MP for Swansea East. “I had a similar reaction I remember when I read [Pride] for the first time, I was in a café and I just absolutely sobbed,"" Gunning told BBC Radio Wales . “It was just a beautiful thing to be a part of and, I feel, very similar actually to Baby Reindeer."" Pride portrayed an alliance between gay rights’ campaigners and pit workers during the 1984 miners' strike and was largely set in the Dulais Valley in south Wales. “I feel like it’s had such an amazing response and affected so many people, and I am just so proud I got to be a part of it all,"" she said. Gunning, 38, recalled being at the screening of Pride and sitting next to Imelda Staunton. “She [Imelda Staunton] said to me, if we never work again, we can say we were in that film. “What a film - it’s just incredible.” Netflix's Baby Reindeer depicts the true story of a stalker, portrayed by Gunning, who harassed the writer and creator of the series, Richard Gadd, over a number of years. In the series Gunning has a strong Scottish accent , though she actually grew up near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. “I have an amazing accent coach who helped me, and she also helped me with my Welsh accent when I did Pride,” she said."

Rafah has been a key entry point for aid and the only exit for people able to flee since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October. A tank brigade moved in to the crossing area after a night of intense strikes. With Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing also closed, the UN warned Gaza's two main aid arteries were now choked off. On Tuesday, the White House said it had been told Kerem Shalom would reopen on Wednesday. On Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating nearby eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a ""limited"" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure. Hamas said Israel's incursion and seizure of the Rafah crossing was aimed at undermining attempts by regional mediators to secure a new ceasefire deal. The Palestinian armed group said on Monday that it had accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar, the basis of which is a weeks-long pause in the fighting and the release of several dozen hostages still held in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Hamas's announcement was ""very far from Israel's necessary requirements"" and that it was a failed attempt to ""disrupt the entry of our forces into Rafah"" . He said he had instructed the mid-level Israeli delegation sent to Cairo on Tuesday to ""stand firm"" on the conditions required for the return of the hostages and on ""vital requirements for ensuring Israel's security"". Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on the Gaza border: ""We will not cease operating in Rafah until Hamas is destroyed, or until the first hostage returns home."" UN Secretary General António Guterres said a deal between Israel and Hamas was ""essential to stop the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and of the hostages and their families"". ""I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show the political courage and spare no effort to secure an agreement now,"" he added. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. More than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 34 of whom are presumed dead. Israel has long insisted that it must eliminate the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah to achieve victory in the war. But with more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, the UN and Western powers have warned that a major ground offensive could have devastating humanitarian consequences. On Monday night, flares lit up the skies over the city and witnesses said there was continuous Israeli bombardment. Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources at the local Kuwait Specialised Hospital as saying that 20 people were killed and dozens injured. Raed al-Derby said his wife and children were killed in an strike that levelled their family home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood. ""We're patient and we will remain steadfast on this land... We are waiting for liberation and this battle will be for liberation, God willing,"" he told Reuters news agency. Seven bodies were reportedly recovered from the rubble of the homes of two families in al-Jneineh. It is one of the eastern neighbourhoods whose estimated 100,000 residents were ordered by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday to evacuate and head towards an ""expanded humanitarian area"", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah. On Tuesday morning, an IDF statement announced that Israeli troops had begun a ""precise"" operation to ""eliminate Hamas terrorists and dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure within specific areas of eastern Rafah"". Fighter jets and ground forces had also struck military structures, underground infrastructure and other sites from which Hamas operated in the Rafah area, killing approximately 20 ""terrorists"" and destroying three operational tunnel shafts, it added. The IDF also announced that troops had ""managed to establish operational control"" of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, following intelligence that it was ""being used for terrorist purposes"". It did not provide any details but said mortars fired from the area on Sunday had killed four Israeli soldiers and injured others at the nearby Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing. The IDF released drone footage showing an armoured vehicle flying a large Israeli flag at the crossing as well as a number of tanks in the square outside the Palestinian migration centre. An IDF official said the Rafah crossing was now closed and that it was working to reopen Kerem Shalom once the security situation allowed it. Later on Tuesday, Hamas launched another four mortars were launched towards Kerem Shalom, according to the IDF. Earlier, a spokesman for the UN humanitarian office said Israel had denied its staff access to both the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. ""The two main arteries for getting aid into Gaza are currently choked off,"" Jens Laerke told reporters in Geneva. He said there was only ""one day of fuel available"" in the UN's storage tanks and warned: ""If no fuel comes in for a prolonged period of time, it would be a very effective way of putting the humanitarian operation in its grave."" There was no immediate response from the IDF. But it has said it is committed to facilitating deliveries of humanitarian aid into and within Gaza and that it has established alternative crossings, including two in the north. Sam Rose of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which is the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza, told the BBC from Rafah that fuel was ""the basis for everything inside Gaza"". ""The fuel powers the water lines, it enables our health centres to keep running, it enables the hospitals to provide life-saving care. If that fuel runs out, then everything grinds to a halt,"" he said. Mr Rose also described the situation for civilians on the ground in Rafah as ""absolutely terrible"". ""The streets are clogged with people who are on the move. These are people from inside the evacuation zone, but also people on the outside... some of who have decided to move early,"" he said. But he added that there was ""nowhere safe for them to go"". ""Half of the safe zone is on a sand dune, which cannot accommodate people for any length of time. The other half is inside Khan Younis, which has been subject to savage bombardment over the past several weeks."""

Employers added 175,000 positions in April, while the jobless rate rose from 3.8% in March to 3.9%, the Labor Department said. It marked the fewest job gains since October and the first time in months that growth was weaker than analysts expected. The US labour market has been closely watched for signs of slowdown, as borrowing costs hover at two-decade highs. Analysts said the report could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year. ""At last there is evidence of some weakness in the US jobs market. Rate cuts will move back up the agenda as a result and there is little doubt that markets will take this as good news,"" said Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Miton Investors. ""While we shouldn’t make too much of single data prints, this could be the start of a positive trend for the Fed,” he added. The Federal Reserve sharply increased interest rates starting in 2022, hoping to cool the economy and ease the pressures that were pushing up prices at the fatest  pace in decades. Analysts had been expecting the US central bank to cut rates this year, as inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, cooled. But at 3.5% in March, it has remained above the bank's 2% target, raising doubts about the timing of such moves. An unexpectedly robust jobs market, which has bolstered consumer spending - and the wider economy - has added to those questions. At the same time, it has raised hopes that the US will be able to avoid a painful economic downturn of the kind that has often historically accompanied a spike in borrowing costs. Shares in the US opened higher after the latest jobs figures from the Labor Department. Satyam Panday, chief US economist at the credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings, said the signs of a hiring slowdown were expected and should help cool inflation, without being so severe as to raise concerns about a recession. ""I would call it a decent jobs report but not too hot, so the Federal Reserve really likes this,"" he said, adding that he expected the Fed would be ready to cut rates by ""perhaps by sometime in the fall or maybe December."" The pace of job growth in April remained relatively resilient, if slower than previous months. Employers added 315,000 positions in March and 236,000 in February. That was about 22,000 fewer than previously estimated, the Labor Department said. In April, most sectors added workers, with health care firms driving the gains, according to the report. Average hourly earnings rose 3.9% over the 12 months to April, a slower pace from the previous month, the Labor Department said."

Ed Chalmers and Katie Hines travelled from Oxford to Lviv, Western Ukraine, in a 4x4 they dubbed 'Hilda' which will be used to evacuate injured soldiers. Ms Hines told BBC Radio Somerset: ""As soon as we arrived in the workshop in Lviv, Hilda was immediately taken by two volunteers. ""We hadn't even switched off the engine before the vehicle was emptied, kitted out and taken off for its new life on the frontline. It was amazing."" Mr Chalmers, 36, and Ms Hines, 35, travelled for three days in a convoy of several other vehicles. The convoy was organised by Driving Ukraine - a group set up at the start of the war to deliver vehicles to the country. Mr Chalmers said: ""We drove through France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and Poland before spending two hours at the border with Ukraine sorting paperwork."" Ms Hines added: ""Hilda did really well. We had no problems mechanically but a couple of the other vehicles had problems. A few hot radiators."" Mr Chalmers said: ""We had lots of support when we were driving along. ""We met people from Norway, America and Belgium - all going in the same direction trying to provide as much aid as possible."" Ms Hines added: ""We bumped into people at services and shared stories and made connections in order to work out how best to help. ""We also had a lot of honking horns and flashing lights, so it's given us a real boost."" Mr Chalmers and Ms Hines will use a mixture of public transport to get back home to Somerset. A fundraising page has also been set up for the journey which has, so far, raised more than £5,000. Mr Chalmers said: ""The money will pay for the petrol, the paperwork to get to Ukraine and modifications to the vehicle, such as new tyres and paint."""

For spring? Groundbreaking. This year's Met Gala theme would not have impressed The Devil Wears Prada's demon magazine editor Miranda Priestly, but it hasn't stopped a string of stars from walking the green carpet in their garden-inspired garments. A-listers were invited to be imaginative with the 2024 dress code, The Garden of Time, which was inspired by a short story of the same name by JG Ballard. Most stars took it literally, taking inspiration from flowers, petals, branches and leaves, while others played around with the short story's themes of time and history. Here are 26 of the most eye-catching outfits: Normally when stars talk about wearing ice, they're referring to diamonds. In Camila Cabello's case, however, she's referring to actual frozen water. ""My hands are really cold,"" the singer said, explaining she was planning to pass the ice on to someone else after she reached the top of the stairs. ""I can't feel my hands."" The large block of ice featured a rose in the centre and accessorised her Ludovic de Saint Sernin gown, which reportedly featured 250,000 crystals and took more than 450 hours to make. The Bear star Ayo Edebiri and Schitt's Creek actor and writer Dan Levy both opted to keep their floral designs on the down low, with outfits that looked traditional from the top but bloomed from the waist down. Edebiri wore a backless column dress by Loewe with a hand-embroidered floral pattern intended to create the illusion of gradual blossoming. Similarly, Levy wore what looked like a classic suit from the top half, but which faded a into a bright floral motif lower down. We've got to hand it to her, Demi Moore had one of the best looks of the night, even if she forgot to bring a bow to go with her arrows. The actress's velvet dress, designed by Harris Reed, was adorned with huge pink peonies made from vintage archival wallpaper. Reed said the dress took more than 5,000 hours to make, adding that it was designed so the flowers would appear to decay as the design flowed further down the dress. Singer Lana Del Rey had not attended the Met Gala since 2018, so decided she needed to give her fashion sense a root-and-branch overhaul. She wore a corseted dress in silk, double georgette and tulle. The dress referenced an Alexander McQueen piece from nearly two decades ago, brought up to date by the fashion house's current creative director Seán McGirr. But the highlight was the special headpiece, which made use of natural hawthorn branches. A glowing Lea Michele walked the carpet wearing a Rodarte turqoise gown with a tulle cape, two months after announcing she was pregnant for the second time. The Glee star and her husband Zandy Reich, who have a three-year-old son, Ever Leo, said they were ""overjoyed"" to be expecting again. If you ever need someone to bring you flowers in the pouring rain, Nicki Minaj has got you covered. The singer's yellow Marni mini-dress was adorned with 3D metal flowers in varying shapes and sizes - one of the most colourful and committed looks of the night. Her look was completed by a bob hairstyle with an arched bubble ponytail. Did Bad Bunny look as if he had yanked his suit jacket out of the sewing machine before the tailor had actually finished making it? Yes. But he still looked great. The rapper and singer wore a Renaissance-inspired custom Maison Margiela suit in navy blue with white threading which resembled pinstripes. He carried a floral bouquet made from the same material as his jacket, reportedly intended to resemble a mixture of roses, Flor de Maga (the national flower of Puerto Rico), and the flax plant, which Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale. The latter is a reference to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, which explores seminal pieces spanning four centuries. A large roll of non-stick tinfoil couldn't hold a candle to Mamma Mia actress Amanda Seyfried, who wore a shiny metallic gown featuring flower appliques. But as eye-catching as the Elizabeth Stewart dress was, all eyes were on Seyfried's matching platinum hair and Chaumet gemstone headpiece by Mélodie Nacrée, which resembled leaves on a vine. The singer and rapper wore a white suit by Luar, which featured asymmetrical panels of sparkly silver sequined fabric, and curved lines of buttons. In terms of adherence to the dress code, we think the outfit could have done with a few more marigolds, but we'll settle for the single white rose which decorated his collar. Speaking on the green carpet, Lil Nas X told the BBC's Brandon Drenon he had reconsidered his attendance earlier in the day, but had ultimately decided: ""You know what, I wanna go, this is always a really nice opportunity to be a part of the cool kids club."" Why dress to look like flowers and trees, when you could pay tribute to the birds who fly among them? When actress Rebecca Ferguson first appeared at Monday's Met Gala, she was draped in a plain black cloak. But the star later opened it up to reveal a beautiful blue Thom Browne gown decorated with black ravens - a memorable look for her inaugural Met. Looking just as ready for the Met Gala as she is to do the washing up, Sydney Sweeney dazzled in a powder blue Miu Miu gown with black flower stems. The Euphoria star ditched her traditional blonde hair in favour of black, handily colour coordinating with her latex gloves. The singer and rapper was wearing a towel on her head and another around her waist as she arrived, but later tossed them aside to reveal a soaking wet white oversized T-shirt. It's possible she was demonstrating what's likely to happen if you venture into your garden during April in the UK. British make-up artist Pat McGrath gave her bronzed eyes with streams of silver mascara seemingly pouring from her eyes. Not that the rest of his outfit isn't lovely, but we simply have to zoom in on Josh O'Connor's shoes. The Crown star wore custom Loewe with an avant-garde tail train, but it was his shoes, accented with floral motifs, which really captured the photographers' attention. For her first ever Met Gala, singer Tyla enlisted Balmain for a dress made of sand - a reference to the sands of time. ""We were looking to do something creative, something completely different for my first Met Gala,"" Tyla told Vogue. ""So when Balmain showed me the idea and sketch, I just knew it was perfect. The idea was crazy, and I loved it."" An innovative idea, perhaps, but one which meant Tyla's movement was so restricted she had to ask for help to climb the stairs. The Kill Bill star teamed up with Tory Burch to pay tribute to the insects, with a purple and blue dress made of taffeta and affixed with 3D butterflies. Burch said her original inspiration was an extinct butterfly, the American Xerces Blue. ""It had the most extraordinary iridescent blue wings that reminded me of Uma's eyes,"" she told Vogue. Last year, Serena Williams and Karlie Kloss revealed their baby bumps at the Met Gala. This year, it was Adwoa Aboah's turn. The British model sported a red H&M skirt with a matching ruffled crop top as she confirmed she was pregnant with her first child. But something else which caught fans' attention was her make-up - or lack of it. Aboah opted for an almost entirely natural look, with her only Met Gala make-up being some red lipstick. Get used to seeing these two together - because they've just shot a movie which is likely to be one of the year's biggest releases. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo will star in the film adaptation of the smash hit stage musical Wicked, set to hit cinemas in November. At the Met Gala, Grande sported a white Loewe gown, while Erivo wore a Thom Browne outfit featuring pink petals and scattered insects. Gigi Hadid is no stranger to the Met Gala - in fact, the event arguably isn't complete without her. This year, the model wore a flowing white Thom Browne gown, with an eye-catching pattern of yellow roses. Crafting the dress took a team of more than 70 people over 13,500 hours to make entirely by hand. The Game of Thrones star looked as if she had come straight from appearing as the evil queen in a fairy tale. Wearing a striking red dress with a black sheer striped cape designed by Maison Margiela, Christie is surely firmly on the radar for Tim Burton's next movie. We're not sure how the her dress linked with the theme but who cares - there is quite simply no situation in life that cannot be improved by the arrival of Cardi B. The star briefly took over the entire landing with her black bespoke gown by Chinese designer Windowsen. We counted nine men helping to carry her dress. For her Met Gala look, Sabrina Carpenter wore an Oscar de la Renta dress, including a bouffant skirt which drew inspiration from an orchid, and jewellery from Bucherer Fine Jewellery. Over the last few months, Carpenter has been dating Saltburn star Barry Keoghan, who also attended the Met Gala wearing a Burberry suit. The pair took the opportunity to make their red carpet debut as a couple, posing for pictures at the top of the famous staircase. The reality star wore a silver John Galliano corset paired with a sheer dress featuring a lace trim with leaves and flowers. Her look was completed with a matching grey cardigan draped over her shoulders. J. Lo was having similar mobility issues to Tyla, as the singer and actress admitted she could barely walk in her dress. ""The Met Gala looks… are not about comfort,"" Lopez noted ahead of the event, delivering perhaps the understatement of the year. The star, one of this year's Met Gala co-chairs, wore a strapless sheer Schiaparelli couture gown that took 800 hours to create and featured more than 2.5 million silver bugles and beads. Fresh from releasing her latest album, Dua Lipa hit the green carpet embraced boudoir dressing at the Met Gala with a custom Marc Jacobs dress. The singer spruced up a lacy all-black dress with bedazzled belly chains, mesh polka-dot gloves and a huge black feather boa over her shoulder. The tennis star sported a metallic gold one shoulder Balenciaga dress and paired it with black gloves, tights and shoes. Made from 25 metres of gold foil-laminated taffeta sourced from Italy, the dress was complemented by headpiece featuring golden floral accessories. The actress, who recently starred in Dune: Part Two and Challengers, was one of the co-chairs of this year's Met Gala. Wearing a John Galliano creation based on a 1999 Dior piece, Zendaya was striking in a royal blue and emerald green dress, with embellishments which looked as if they were inspired by fruit trees. But the hottest star in the world right now wasn't done. Around two hours after she first walked the carpet, she returned to give fans an encore, with new make-up, a new dress and a whole new vibe. Zendaya reappeared wearing a black gown - a 1996 piece from John Galliano's Givenchy era - paired with an entire bouquet of flowers on her head. Florals? For spring? Sorry, Miranda, we're here for it. Read previous Met Gala round-ups: ."

Russia said Ukraine was behind the attack, which it said injured three people. Ukraine has denied involvement. The giant Russian-held nuclear plant, with six reactors, is on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned against such attacks. IAEA head Rafael Grossi said Sunday's drone strike was ""reckless"" and ""a major escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers"" facing the plant. The Zaporizhzhia plant, in southern Ukraine, is the largest in Europe. Russian forces seized it shortly after launching their February 2022 full-scale invasion and have occupied it ever since, alongside most of the Zaporizhzhia region. The facility stopped generating power in 2022, but needs a constant supply of electricity to cool one of its reactors which is in a state of ""hot conservation"", meaning it is not fully offline. The IAEA, which has a team of experts at Zaporizhzhia, confirmed ""physical impact of drone attacks"" at the plant, including at one of the reactors. The plant's Russian-installed administration said radiation levels were normal and that there was no serious damage. The IAEA said the damage had not compromised nuclear safety, but it warned that ""this is a serious incident with potential to undermine [the] integrity of the reactor's containment system"". Mr Grossi specified there had been ""at least three direct hits"" against the plant's ""main reactor containment structures"". ""This cannot happen,"" he said. ""No one can conceivably benefit or get any military or political advantage from attacks against nuclear facilities. This is a no go."" Both Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse each other of shelling the plant and risking a serious nuclear accident. The plant's Russian administration has said Ukraine's armed forces were behind the attack, but Ukraine has denied the allegation. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the attacks were a ""very dangerous provocation"". Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate spokesman Andriy Yusov told the Ukrainska Pravda news website that ""Ukraine was not involved in any armed provocations on the site."" The plant is ""illegally occupied by Russia,"" he added. Mr Yusov accused Russia of endangering the nuclear facility, the civilian population and the environment by carrying out strikes on the plant itself. Last month the IAEA said its team of experts at the plant had heard explosions every day for a week. At the time, Mr Grossi said: ""For more than two years now, nuclear safety and security in Ukraine has been in constant jeopardy. We remain determined to do everything we can to help minimise the risk of a nuclear accident that could harm people and the environment, not only in Ukraine."" The region of Zaporizhzhia came under fire early on Monday morning.  Governor Ivan Federov said three people were killed and three more were wounded after Russian forces struck eight populated areas over 350 times in the space of 24 hours. Last week, a Russian strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed four people and wounded more than 20."

The extensive jewellery collection up for grabs, estimated to be worth up to £2 million, includes a diamond ring gifted to her from Sir Elton John. Dame Shirley, who grew up in Cardiff's Tiger Bay, famously sang about diamonds in the title track the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever starring Sir Sean Connery. She said she accepted the offer to sing the track as the lyrics ""rang true"" to her. More than 80 pieces of jewellery will be exhibited at Sotheby's in Paris from 4 October before being auctioned on 10 October. Dame Shirley, whose other hits include Big Spender and Goldfinger, said: ""I fell in love with jewellery when I first discovered natural pearls as an up-and-coming singer and I bought myself my first string of pearls - the first piece of jewellery I'd ever bought. ""However, I quickly graduated to my lifelong passion for diamonds which preceded the recording of Diamonds Are Forever. ""In fact, I accepted to sing the song because it rang true to me and the way I felt about diamonds then and now."" She added: ""Collecting jewellery for me is like collecting memories and this collection is full of them. ""All the pieces are meaningful and have a story to tell, whether I bought them for myself or they were gifted to me."" ""There is this beautiful 1960s vintage Van Cleef & Arpels ring covered in white diamonds that Elton John gave me after I sang at one of his Aids gala evenings and which I've worn so many times. ""Or the ruby and diamond heart parure I spotted in a fine jeweller's window during a stopover in Bangkok on my way to my very first concert tour of Australia.

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein was among those detained by police. Protestors are demanding institutions boycott companies and individuals with ties to Israel. But some Jewish students have complained about alleged antisemitism from some demonstrators. A spokesperson for Ms Stein said she was one of around 80 people to have been arrested at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. The Green Party presidential candidate was not currently believed to be facing charges, the spokesperson added. California State Polytechnic became the latest to announce it would move to remote teaching. The protests have seen in-person teaching cancelled and graduation ceremonies postponed. Tents first appeared on the college green at Columbia on 17 April. The protests then spread across the country after police in riot gear were sent to clear the tents, arresting more than 100 students. Shortly after, students erected another protest camp at Yale University in Connecticut. At Northeastern University in Boston, over 100 protesters were arrested for trespassing on Saturday by the Massachusetts State Police after refusing to clear their tents from college grounds, according to a police statement. The camp was cleared by police. Northeastern University wrote on X that ""demonstrations had been infiltrated by professional organisers"" with no connection to the university. Antisemitic slurs had been heard, it added, saying: ""We cannot tolerate this kind of hate on campus."" Protest leaders strongly rejected the allegations. At the University of South California, pro-Palestinian demonstrators returned to campus days after police were called to clear a protest at the university's Alumni Park. The protest was reportedly mostly peaceful but the university administration reported ""vandalism"" to campus property after Saturday's protest. The university said the campus had been vandalised ""by individuals who are part of the group that has continued to illegally camp on our campus"", adding that a statue and fountain had been damaged. The campus would be temporarily closed to non-residents, the university said. Twenty-three people were arrested at Indiana University on Saturday. Other campuses, including Columbia and Emory University in Georgia, were reportedly quieter Saturday. The protests were sparked by anger at Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched the offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, mostly civilians, were killed and 253 others were taken to Gaza as hostages, when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza on 7 October last year."

""Travis Scott's Utopia - Circus Maximus Tour is set to continue this summer with a headline performance here at Co-op Live on 13 July 2024,"" the Manchester venue posted on social media. Co-op Live is set to become the largest arena in the UK, holding 23,500 people. But its opening, scheduled for April, has been beset by delays. After a gig by another US rapper, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, was called off following a ""technical issue"" during a soundcheck - in which a nozzle from the ventilation and air-conditioning system reportedly fell from the ceiling - Co-op Live said it was taking ""a short pause to fully ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue"". Olivia Rodrigo and Keane had to cancel performances as a result. Others, including Take That, moved their gigs to the rival AO Arena. And so far, Co-op Live has staged only a test event featuring Rick Astley. But the venue has now said it does not ""expect further impact on our opening season"", adding: ""We look forward to welcoming you to the arena from 14 May 2024."" British band Elbow are now scheduled to be Co-op Live's opening act. The Eagles, Nicki Minaj, Pet Shop Boys, Stevie Nicks and Eric Clapton are also all due to play the arena. Following a sell-out run in the US, Scott has just announced a European tour also including his largest UK headline show, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, on 11 July. The tour is promoting his fourth - and first UK number one - album, Utopia. Last July, Scott had to cancel a show in front of Egypt's pyramids, because of ""complex production issues"". In 2021, Scott, 33, performed at the Astroworld music festival in Houston, Texas, at which 10 people died after fans surged towards the stage."

""We are a civil society, and order must prevail,"" Mr Biden said from the White House, in his first direct remarks about a wave of student unrest. Police have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps. That includes 209 arrests early on Thursday at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Hundreds of officers in riot gear moved on to UCLA's main campus before dawn and cleared its pro-Palestinian camp. They set off flash bangs and flares, loaded demonstrators on to police buses, and tore down the makeshift barriers and tents that had been erected on campus a week ago. In a statement, UCLA called the camp ""both unlawful and a breach of policy. It led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission."" ""Demonstrators directly interfered with instruction by blocking students' pathways to classrooms,"" it added, while their clashes with pro-Israeli counter-demonstrators ""put too many [students] in harm's way"". Addressing the nationwide protests hours later, Mr Biden said: ""We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent. But neither are we a lawless country. ""There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos. People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked."" The Uncommitted National Movement, a group of Arab-American voters opposed to Mr Biden's re-election campaign this year, accused him of ""smearing"" anti-war protesters. ""It's clear Biden isn't listening to young people nationwide, or to the over half a million uncommitted voters asking him to change course. We hope he hears us before it's too late,"" leader Abbas Alawieh said. The campus protests in support of Gaza have now spread to nearly 140 colleges in at least 45 states, according to a BBC tally, and at least six other countries. Demonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict. But many colleges have called in the police, with violence erupting on some campuses, as well as rising reports of antisemitic harassment against Jewish students. The tensions at UCLA's main Westwood campus erupted on Tuesday night when a masked pro-Israeli group breached the tent camp on Dickson Plaza and attacked campers with bats, tear gas and other items. Police appeared to move slowly and were criticised by students, observers and some political leaders for their response. After regaining control of the area on Wednesday, law enforcement created a tight security cordon. Administrators had already declared ""an unlawful assembly"" and, early on Thursday morning, officers moved in. As police breached the perimeter, some demonstrators could be seen locking arms and using their plywood barriers as makeshift shields, while others donned hard hats and seemed to arm themselves with umbrellas. Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, said she had been at an ""incident command post"" alongside law enforcement leaders at the campus throughout the operation. ""Harassment, vandalism and violence have no place at UCLA or anywhere in our city,"" she wrote in a statement. Kenza, a UCLA student involved with the protests (she did not provide her last name), told the BBC the encampment had been ""completely peaceful"". ""It's absolutely ridiculous that we would be deemed as a threat to civil society when the reality is we have been harassed for the past week,"" she said. Campus operations will be limited on Thursday and Friday, with all classes moving to remote instruction, UCLA said. A handful of institutions - including Northwestern, Brown, the University of Minnesota and the University of Vermont - have reached agreements with protesters over divestment matters. But arrests have been made in the past 24 hours at Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas."

John Ystumllyn was abducted as a child in western Africa in the 18th Century and raised in Gwynedd, north Wales. ""Through adversity, he really triumphed,"" said the F1 star, who was appearing at his fifth Met. One of fashion's biggest nights, the gala is a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, held annually in New York. Each year, attendees at the star-studded event - organised by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour - are given a theme to dress to, with this year's being ""The Garden of Time"". ""What I love about the Met, and what Anna (Wintour) does with the Met, is that I’m able to really deep dive into the theme,"" Hamilton told Vogue on the red carpet. ""I did a lot of research and I came across this 18th Century gardener who, through slavery times, came across from Africa to Wales and became the first black gardener in Wales. ""Through adversity, he really triumphed, so that’s where the inspiration really came from."" That gardener, John Ystumllyn, was snatched from his home when he was about eight years old and likely brought to Wales to become a servant for society aristocrats. According to a biography written in 1888, a century after his death, John Ystumllyn told how ""white men arrived and caught him and took him away"". Hamilton highlighted the thorns on his outfit representing the pain caused by the slavery trade. Dr Marian Gwyn, of Race Council Cymru, previously told BBC Wales Ystumllyn's abduction would have been ""a very traumatic experience"". ""Yet despite the trauma of that, he came and he settled in Wales - he made it his home,"" she said. He married a local woman, Margaret Gruffydd, who had been a maid at the Ystumllyn estate, and had seven children, five of whom survived into adulthood. John was not himself enslaved. Dr Gwyn said he was ""very much a free man"" and was able to move from job to job. His natural ability in horticulture meant he was never short of work. In 2021, a new rose, believed to be the first of its kind, was named in Ystumllyn's memory . Hamilton also revealed that a poem has been stitched into the inside of his Burberry jacket by Children's Laureate Wales poet Alex Wharton. The poem, titled The Gardener, is inspired by Ystumllyn's life after arriving in Wales. ""I hope the sun pours light upon our skin. And we melt into each other, into everything. Maybe the trees will speak, as they sometimes do. Whispers from the shade - Run, run away,"" read the excerpt in Hamilton's jacket. On Hamilton's social media, he said he was ""inspired by the legacy of John Ystumllym and the beauty of his work""."

Nicaragua brought the case, arguing that Germany had breached the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel. The German government said the lawsuit was unjustified. Berlin is a staunch ally of Israel and the second largest supplier of arms to the country after the US. A final ruling could take years. Today's decision was over emergency measures to be implemented swiftly. In 2023 some 30% of Israel's military equipment purchases came from Germany, totalling $326.5m (£257m) last year - a tenfold increase on 2022. Nicaragua said Germany's arms sales to Israel made it complicit in Israel's alleged war crimes. Israel has rejected accusations of genocide and says its actions in Gaza are focussed on destroying Hamas. The Central American country had brought the case to the Hague in early March to ask judges to issue emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance. It also said Germany had breached the UN genocide convention by ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency, UNRWA. Germany was one of 15 Western nations which suspended funding for UNRWA over allegations that some of the agency's staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel. Writing on X following the court's verdict, the German ministry of foreign affairs welcomed the decision and said Germany was ""not a party to the conflict in the Middle East"". It added that Germany was the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians and that it was working ""urgently"" to ensure that aid reaches the people of Gaza. Presiding Judge Nawaf Salam said the ICJ - which ruled 15-1 - remains ""deeply concerned about the catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip"". The court will now have to decide whether it has jurisdiction over the case. If so, it will then proceed to judge the case itself - which could take years. Nicaragua - a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause - likely decided to take Germany to court as Germany is the second-largest arms exporter to Israel. The US, which provides Israel with a much higher volume of weapons, does not recognise the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction. Critics of Nicaragua's case have highlighted the country's chequered human rights record. The government of President Daniel Ortega has jailed opponents and banned protests. In March, the UK's mission to the UN accused the government of a ""relentless"" crackdown on human rights."

Mr Blinken said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it. Mediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. It reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners. ""We are determined to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home and to get it now, and the only reason that that wouldn't be achieved is because of Hamas,"" Mr Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv. ""There is a proposal on the table, and as we've said, no delays, no excuses. The time is now."" A senior Hamas official has denied the group is to blame for delays on reaching a new deal. Families of the hostages were demonstrating outside and Mr Blinken greeted them, saying setting their loved ones free was ""at the heart of everything we're trying to do"". About 130 hostages from among 253 kidnapped by Hamas during its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October remain unaccounted for. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. The rest have been released or rescued. The top US diplomat later visited the Israeli port of Ashdod, about 30km (20 miles) north of Gaza, where he insisted that Israel had made meaningful concessions to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal. Mr Blinken said Israel had made progress on getting more aid into Gaza but this needed to be accelerated given the immense scale of need. Ashdod was recently opened to aid shipments destined for Gaza, where the UN has warned of severe food shortages and looming famine. On Wednesday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 30 trucks of humanitarian supplies from Jordan had for the first time entered northern Gaza via the Erez crossing. Mr Blinken also repeated the US position that Israel should not launch a military incursion into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah without a clear plan to protect more than a million Palestinians who have been sheltering from the war there in dire humanitarian conditions. ""On Rafah itself - our position is clear, it has not changed, it won't change. We cannot, will not support a major military operation in Rafah absent an effective plan making sure that civilians are not harmed. We have not seen such a plan,"" he said. Rafah is the only major city in Gaza that IDF ground forces have not taken control of during half a year of war. However the city has been repeatedly hit by deadly Israeli air strikes. On Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who also met Mr Blinken on Wednesday - said Israel would launch an invasion of Rafah regardless of truce talks with Hamas. ""We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory,"" he said. Members of Mr Netanyahu's governing coalition are divided on the issue. Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Israeli TV a Rafah operation would be suspended if there was a deal. But far-right ministers have said if that happens they will bring down the government. The UN, Western allies of Israel and humanitarian agencies have all warned that an assault on Rafah risks a humanitarian disaster. West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it would be the ""biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history"" because, he said, it would trigger large-scale displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza entirely. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov blamed Ukrainian forces for the strike near the village of Beryozovka, which he said was carried out with drones and hit minibuses transporting workers to a meat production facility, as well as a private car. Mr Gladkov said several other locations in Belgorod region had also come under attack in the last 24 hours, with residential buildings damaged. The Belgorod region has often been targeted by Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hours later, Mr Gladkov reported another fatal attack, this time in the village of Nikolskoye. At least one person was killed when an outdoor cooking area was struck, he said. The deadliest strike on the region so far occurred in December, when a drone and rocket attack killed 25 people and wounded another 100 in the city of Belgorod. In March, Mr Gladkov said 9,000 children would be evacuated from the city and the wider region after shelling that authorities have blamed on Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia has continued to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, damaging a facility in the northern Sumy region - which borders Belgorod region - in an overnight bombardment. Ukraine's energy ministry said the attack had left more than 400,000 people without power. Power was partially restored by morning, local authorities said. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia is massing troops in the regions of Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk in preparation for an offensive operation against northeastern Ukraine and the city of Kharkiv. Citing a Ukrainian military observer, the ISW said that the Russian military has gathered roughly 50,000 personnel. Ukrainian officials have long warned that Russia is gearing up to launch an attack to seize Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. On Monday, the Russian Ministry of Defence said it had started preparations for missile drills simulating the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons. Tactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads and delivery systems intended for use on the battlefield, or for a limited strike. TASS news agency reported that the drills, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, were expected to take place ""in the near future"" and would involve missile formations as well as air and naval forces. The decision to hold the drills was taken in response to ""provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation"", the ministry added. Although it did not name the officials, Russia has repeatedly criticised remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron about possible intervention by Nato troops in Ukraine. Russia also reacted angrily to comments last week by the UK Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, who said that Ukraine can use British weapons for strikes within Russia ."

All the incidents involved took place outside of Gaza before the current war. Israel took corrective action in four units, giving ""additional information"" on the fifth, the department says. This means all the units remain eligible for US military assistance. Washington is Israel's major military backer, supplying it with $3.8bn (£3bn) worth of weapons and defence systems per year. The announcement is the first determination of its kind for any Israeli unit by the US government. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said five security forces units committed gross violations of human rights. ""Four of these units have effectively remediated these violations, which is what we expect partners to do,"" he said. ""For a remaining unit, we continue to be in consultations and engagements with the government of Israel; they have submitted additional information as it pertains to that unit,"" he added. The department denies claims it backed down under political pressure by continuing military assistance to the unit despite being unable to say whether or not there had been any accountability in the case. ""We are engaging with them in a process, and we will make an ultimate decision when it comes to that unit when that process is complete,"" said Mr Patel. All the incidents are believed to have taken place in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem in recent years. Under America's ""Leahy Law"", sponsored in 1997 by then-Senator Patrick Leahy, a finding that a foreign military unit committed gross violations of human rights means it can be cut from receiving US military assistance. The US government says it considers torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance and rape as such types of violations when implementing the Leahy law. Even when there is such a finding, there is an exception to cutting military assistance if the state department is satisfied the cases have been dealt with and justice pursued by the government involved. It says Israel did do this - so-called remediation - in four of the five units. However, the department declined to give any details of the incidents, the remediation, the units involved or evidence to support whether the remediation was effective. The US was reportedly on the brink of announcing it would cut military aid to the fifth unit, but says new information from Israel means it will make a decision later. The unit involved is widely reported to be the Netzah Yehuda battalion, a special men-only unit set up in 1999 where ultra-Orthodox Jews serve. Israel investigated the battalion over the death of 80-year-old Palestinian-American Omar Assad who died after being bound and gagged by soldiers during a West Bank village search in 2022. At the time the US called for a ""thorough criminal investigation and full accountability"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later said they regretted Mr Assad's death, and a commander would be ""reprimanded"" and two soldiers barred from senior positions for two years - but would not be prosecuted. Asked about reports an IDF unit would be the first ever to face the US government designation under the Leahy Law, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on 19 April: ""I made determinations. You can expect to see them in the days ahead."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to reject any sanctions on the country's military , saying he would ""fight it with all my strength"", while Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and war cabinet minister Benny Gantz spoke on the phone to Mr Blinken. Pressed by the BBC on Monday over whether the state department had delayed or softened its position on withdrawing military assistance to the fifth unit, Mr Patel said officials would make a decision when their consultations with the Israeli government were complete."

A “goth gremlin goblin witch” is holding a candlelit séance and summoning the spirit of a minotaur. Nemo (the singer, not the fish) has skinned a muppet and is cavorting around in its skin, while singing Mozart’s Queen Of The Night. It can only be the Eurovision Song Contest. Sometimes I think the competition is out of surprises, an echo chamber of its former glories, then along comes a year like 2024 to prove that (a) Eurovision is as magical and moving and weird and emotional as it’s ever been and (b) I’m an idiot. After weeks of intensive rehearsals, the action kicks off in Malmö, Sweden, this Tuesday with the first of two semi-finals. The winner will be decided on Saturday, 11 May.  To help you prepare, here’s a guide to all 37 songs in the contest – which I’ve sorted into barely-coherent musical categories, because everyone needs a system. The success of Käärijä’s mutant rave-rap anthem Cha Cha Cha at last year’s contest has unlocked something potent. Everywhere you look in Malmö, there’s a sense of musical experimentation and outré risqué performance. Top of the heap is Croatia’s Baby Lasagna , whose ridiculously catchy Rim Tim Tagi Dim is currently the bookmakers' favourite to win. Loud and aggressive and memorable and fun, it blends elements of rock and techno to tell the story of a farm boy saying goodbye to his milking stool and setting out for the big city. According to singer Marko Purišić, the lyrics are a reference to the brain drain that’s affecting Croatia’s economy. Another strong contender Switzerland’s Nemo, whose song The Code is a hare-brained hybrid of pop, opera and electro. Inspired by Nemo’s childhood experience as an opera singer, it uses elements of Bizet’s Carmen and Mozart’s The Magic Flute to explain how they came to terms with their non-binary identity. It’s surprisingly intense. Finland’s Windows95Man, on the other hand, is trying too hard to stand out, emerging from a giant egg and dancing around in his underpants. But all the antics aren’t enough to distract from the fatally generic Europop of his song, No Rules . I’m much more enamoured by Joost Klein from the Netherlands who takes a whistle-stop, happy hardcore tour of Europe in the infectiously silly Europapa . Performed in high-rise shoulderpads, while LED screens project images of currywurst and paella, the song is nonetheless rooted in tragedy. Joost lost his parents at a young age, and the song reflects that no matter how far he travels, he can’t outrun his grief. Pull on your dancing trousers, because Eurovision is ready to party. There are a ton of uptempo dance-pop numbers this year, led (gasp) by the UK’s entrant, Olly Alexander . Formerly of the pop band Years and Years, his bubbling synthpop anthem, Dizzy , recalls Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive by way of The Pet Shop Boys. Instantly memorable, if a little undercooked, the song has risen to 10th place in the odds after rehearsal footage was released this week , showcasing some memorable choreography and a revamped ending to the song. But he faces stiff competition, as pop fans are spoilt for choice this year. Cypriot entrant Silia Kapsis , for example, channels Janet and Britney with her infectiously bombastic song, Liar . Her lyrics could do with some work (“The only problem in this room is about you”) but the breath-taking dance routine will be popular with voters. Not to be outdone on the choreography, Malta’s Sarah Bonnici does the splits and a somersault during her performance. But her song, Loop , is paper-thin, and languishes in last place with bookmakers. By contrast, Spanish duo Nebulossa have already had a viral hit with their song, Zorra . The title translates as both “vixen” and “bitch” and the lyrics are a commentary on the double standards women face. It’s a shimmering piece of 80s candy-pop that’s good enough to eat. Meanwhile, five-time Eurovision winners Luxembourg are back in the competition for the first time in 31 years, represented by Tali Golergant . She punches above her weight with Fighter , a vibey, syncopated pop slammer whose chorus sticks in your head like a sausage on a fork. Looming over the competition like a pop Godzilla is Albanian diva Besa . Her song, Titan , has an appropriately gargantuan hook and a thrilling tempo-switch at the end. Her bright blue bodysuit seems to have been inspired by Steps' video for Deeper Shade of Blue. And why not? It's a classic. Rounding out the field are Iceland’s Hera Björk with Scared Of Heights and Polish singer Luna with The Tower. Both songs are both perfectly accessible, radio-friendly pop – but I suspect they’ll struggle to survive the semi-finals. Eurovision wouldn’t be Eurovision without a raven-haired diva over-emoting about her personal struggles, and this year is no exception. Israel’s Eden Golan has the best of the bunch – a stirringly emotional piano ballad called Hurricane , in which a woman mourns the end of a love affair. Originally called October Rain, the song was rewritten at the request of organisers . The initial lyrics were thought to reference the Hamas attacks of 7 October and were rejected for breaking rules on political neutrality. Golan’s participation is causing controversy, however, amid the Israel-Gaza war, and there are pro-Palestinian marches planned in Malmö throughout Eurovision week. The singer has reportedly been confined to her hotel room outside of rehearsals. Could that affect her performance? Maybe. Serbia’s song, Ramonda , is another strong contender, with war references of its own. The title refers to the flower that people wear in remembrance of Serbia’s soldiers in World War One, and singer Teya Dora delivers the sorrowful lyrics with a beautifully understated delivery. Dialling up the histrionics is Slovenian contestant Raiven , whose song Veronika is a bit too piercing for my tastes. I prefer In The Middle , by Moldova’s Natalia Barbu . It boasts a catchy Arabian-style post-chorus - but it doesn’t feel like a finalist, either. Elsewhere, Portugal’s iolanda has submitted the pretty, melodic ballad Grito , which opens with an arresting a capella, but loses direction towards the end. I don’t know why, but several of this year’s contestants are in thrall to the sounds of Ibiza, circa 1992. Squelchy acid synths and brutally aggressive kick drums are all the rage. And why not? Eurovision is only one night, but the acts tour the club circuit for the rest of the year. Having a guaranteed floor-filler in your setlist makes good business sense. Taking it all incredibly literally is Austria’s Kaleen , and her unequivocally titled We Will Rave . With shades of Madonna’s Hung Up and the wordless “ roma-ah-ah ” hooks of Bad Romance, it’s a pulse-quickening banger. Defending Eurovision champions Sweden are sending chart-topping pop twins Marcus & Martinus to Malmö with a squonking, bass-heavy track called Unforgettable. Their staging is incredible – full of pulsing LED screens and body-popping choreography – making them credible contenders. Another fan favourite is Silvester Belt, whose simmering house track Luktelk (Wait) went straight to number one on Lithuania’s Spotify chart. A more subdued and moody track, it’s all about someone who appears happy and functional in public while struggling in private. His early rehearsals don’t seem too promising, but the song already has lots of fans. There’s a refreshing trend this year of countries using ancient musical traditions for inspiration – producing many of my favourite songs in the line-up. Top billing goes to Greek singer Marina Satti , whose avant-garde sound collage Zari mixes traditional Greek melodies with tabla drums, a reggaeton beat, broken vocal samples and a solo on an ancient Persian pipe called the Zurna. “ I’m gonna do it my way ,” she declares, in the year’s most on-the-nose lyric. Armenian band Ladaniva are just as ambitious, blending the ethnic music of Armenia, India and the Balkans with a Western “kick ass and take down names later” attitude. Their song, Jako , is the shortest in the competition but they make it count, putting on one of the most joyous, spirited performances on the Malmö stage. Norwegian folk act Gåte go in the opposite direction, with a dark and gruesome tale of revenge that’s ripped from the pages of the country’s folklore. The lyrics of Ulveham tell the story of a “fair and sightly maiden” whose evil stepmother banishes her to the forest and curses her with “skin like a grey wolf”. By the end of the song, she’s gone feral - tearing out her stepmother’s heart and drinking her brothers’ blood. Remind me never to take a picnic in the Norwegian woods. A less successful hybrid is the combination of didgeridoo and banging house beats on One Milkali by Australian act Electric Fields – although the song deserves merit for including lyrics in the indigenous language of Yankunytjatjara, the first time a dialect of Australia’s First People will feature at Eurovision. Azerbaijan’s Fahree also branches out, including traditional Azeri mugham vocals from singer Ilkin Dovlatov on their entry, Özünlə Apar , but the song has little else to recommend it. Estonia have more fun, submitting two bands for the price of one, with 5MIINUST x Puuluup . The latter is a nu-folk act, famous for their skills on the Talharpa, a rare wooden lyre from northern Europe. The former is a hip-hop group, who deliver dense, humorous lyrics about a drugs bust on the song with the longest-ever title at Eurovision: “We (really) don’t know anything about (these) drugs”. Finally, we have Italian iconoclast Angelina Mango , who serves up a delectable mix of reggaeton, cumbia and Latin soul on her song La Noia . The title actually translates as “boredom” but, with its curlicued guitar lines and restlessly evolving melodies, you'd have to be stony of heart to find it less than invigorating. I can’t recommend it highly enough. Lordi and Måneskin proved that rock has a place at Eurovision, and the tradition continues this year, with three acts clinging onto distortion pedals for dear life. Most memorable is Ireland’s Bambie Thug , the only singer who’s bringing a screaming coach to Sweden. The musician describes their sound as “Ouija-pop” and, for the uninitiated, that means a blend of gothic electro, angst-ridden pop and screamcore, which has unsettled some conservative critics in their homeland. Fittingly, their song, Doomsday Blue , is about having your potential overlooked, and the marginalisation of the queer community. It’s an acquired taste, but is the boldest song on this year’s line-up. San Marino’s Megara bravely match Bambie for intensity, with the stomping electro-rock of their entry 11:11 . Reminiscent of Republica’s Ready To Go, the song is inspired by the knock-backs and rejections the band have suffered on the road to fame. In the post-chorus, they spell out the phrase M-E-L-A-P-E-L-A (“I don’t care”), adding: “ If you don't love me/ Other people will love me. ” Enough said. And if it's pop-punk you’re after, Czech singer Aiko has you covered. Her track, Pedestal , was co-written by Steve Ansell of the Brighton band Blood Red Shoes, which explains it’s debt to British indie. Triumph over adversity is the biggest cliché in the Eurovision lyric book – but in the right hands, it can be surprisingly effective. France’s Slimane , for example, sounds on the verge of tears as he begs his lover to come back to Paris on the «chanson dramatique» Mon Amour . Over the border in Belgium, Mustii confronts his anxieties with genuine conviction on the rabble-rousing Before The Party’s Over. Ukraine, meanwhile, continue their Eurovision hot streak with the powerful and solemn ballad Teresa and Maria . Performed by Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil , the lyrics are a plea for protection, addressed to the Christian saints Mother Theresa and Virgin Mary. Written while Russian missiles fall on Ukraine, it’s hard not to read the lyrics as a reference to the war – and the two performers (a kindergarten teacher-turned-rapper and a  famous YouTube singer) have no trouble conveying the urgency and desperation of their situation. Hoping to reverse Germany’s last-place finish in 2023 is gravel-voiced singer-songwriter Isaak . He sings about overcoming his demons on the propulsive Always On The Run – whose galloping beats and gospel overtones make him sound like a German Rag N’ Bone Man (Lumpenhändler Mann?) Bringing up the rear, we have Danish singer Saba and Latvia’s Dons , employing well-worn metaphors about “crying rivers” and “breathing underwater” on their tracks Sand and Hollow . You won’t need to worry about them beyond the semi-finals. And last of all, there’s Georgia’s magnificently-named Nutsa Buzaladze , whose song Firefighter opens with a peal of thunder and recycles a bunch of Eurovision lyrics about rising from the ashes like a phoenix. She’s hard to discount, though. A contestant on last year’s American Idol – where she performed with Kylie Minogue – Nutsa has stage presence to spare and Shakira-level choreography. It should be just enough to transcend the limitations of her song and rise (like a phoenix!) to the finals. See you in Malmö."

During a visit to Kyiv, he said the UK would provide £3bn ($3.75bn) per year for as long as necessary. ""Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,"" Lord Cameron said. Russia condemned what it called ""another very dangerous statement"". ""This is a direct escalation of tension around the Ukrainian conflict, which would potentially pose a threat to European security,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Lord Cameron did not directly endorse the idea of British weapons being used to strike targets inside Russia. But until now, the UK has generally let it be understood - without spelling it out - that weapons such as the long range Storm Shadow missile should only be used inside sovereign Ukrainian territory. There have been several examples of its successful use in Russian-occupied Crimea, including against elements of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. However, coming on the heels of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s pledge to give Ukraine £3bn ($3.76bn) in military assistance every year for the foreseeable future, it seems Lord Cameron wanted to emphasise that it is up to Ukraine to decide what it does with it. The US has reportedly urged Ukraine to halt its strikes on oil refineries in Russia, fearing it could provoke an escalation in the conflict. Mr Peskov also took aim at French President Emmanuel Macron, who said this week that the West would ""legitimately"" have to consider whether to send ground troops to Ukraine ""if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request"". Mr Macron's remarks to The Economist were a ""very dangerous trend"", said the Kremlin spokesman. However, the French leader made clear in his interview that if Russia won in Ukraine, there would be no security in Europe. Russian forces have seized several villages in eastern Ukraine during recent advances, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of weapons and manpower. Ukrainian intelligence officials also believe Russia is gearing up for a summer offensive in the north-eastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy. The commander of the national guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, warned recently that Russia was preparing ""unpleasant surprises"" and quietly recruiting 30,000 people a month. A Russian strike on Kharkiv on Friday killed an elderly woman in her home, and a tram carrying passengers also came under fire, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov.  Ukraine's military says Russia's immediate target is the strategic hilltop town of Chasiv Yar, 15km (9 miles) west of the devastated city of Bakhmut. Officials believe the eastern town could enable Russian forces to attack major eastern cities such as Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. The military has suggested Moscow is keen to seize Chasiv Yar before Russians mark victory in World War Two on 9 May. However, a Ukrainian military spokesman has denied that Russian troops have broken through to the Siverskyi Donetsk-Donbas canal on the outskirts of the town. Russia claimed on Friday that its forces had captured three villages in Ukraine's east in the past two weeks. Military spokesman Lt Col Nazar Voloshyn said the invading force had gained a foothold in the village of Ocheretyne but Ukrainian soldiers were working to drive them out. Lord Cameron, who met President Volodymr Zelensky in Kyiv, said it was Russia that had launched an attack into Ukraine and Ukraine ""absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia"". Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said his remarks were tantamount to admitting the West was involved in a ""hybrid war"" against Moscow. The UK has provided billions of pounds in military support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, ranging from tanks and precision-guided missiles to air-defence systems. A year ago the UK confirmed it had begun supplying long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles with a range of more than 250km (155 miles). Meanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said he had appealed to Lord Cameron to help restore the country's energy infrastructure which has been badly damaged by repeated Russian missile strikes.

The Stonemason’s Yard - painted by Canaletto in about 1725 - has been loaned from the National Gallery in London. It will be the main attraction of the new Idyll and Industry exhibition at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, from Friday. It was last in Wales during World War Two when it was one of 2,000 priceless artworks moved from London to a slate mine in Blaenau Ffestiniog to protect them from German bombs. More than 80 years later it is back and will be on display at the library until September. The exhibition tells the story of The Stonemason’s Yard and how it came to Wales as a ""refugee"" from bombing to be safely protected in the cavernous Manod slate mines. Winston Churchill – prime minister during the war - ordered the National Gallery's collection to be moved away from London and hidden in ""caves and cellars"". Brick studios and air conditioning were installed inside the mines to store the National Gallery’s collection which included work by artists such as Titian, Michelangelo and Constable. Long after the paintings had been returned to London, Glyn Williams and his family from Blaenau Ffestiniog became the owners of the quarry. In the 1980s, Mr Williams said he had plans to expand the work there but the UK government wanted to keep the warehouses in place and restricted blasting at the quarry in case the warehouses were damaged. Mr Williams won a court victory to effectively evict the government and expanded quarrying at Manod. In 1983 he helped produce a booklet to remember the time the priceless works of art were stored in the quarry. He said transporting some of the paintings proved difficult – a portrait of Charles I on horseback by Van Dyck - was 3.67m (12ft) tall and 2.92m (9ft 7in) wide. Also, a trench had to be dug under a railway bridge in Llan Ffestiniog as the gap was not big enough for the lorry transporting the artwork. Mr Williams said: ""But they still miscalculated by about two inches, so they had to let all the air out of the tyres to get under the bridge and then pump them up again to go up to the quarry."" He said the paintings were well looked after – experts stayed near the quarry to care for them and a garrison of soldiers guarded them - while air conditioning units kept the air ""quite clean and static"" to protect them. After the war ended, the 2,000 works were returned to their galleries, many to the National Gallery some to Buckingham Palace. As part of the National Gallery’s 200th anniversary celebrations, 12 masterpieces from its collection are on display across the UK. The exhibition in Aberystwyth is the only one in Wales and, for the first time at the national library, there will be an audio described tour for some of the items for visitors who are blind or visually-impaired. Rhodri Llwyd Morgan, chief executive of the National Library of Wales, said it was ""an honour to have one of Canaletto's masterpieces here"". Canaletto was born in 1697 and raised in Venice. and was the city's most famous Venetian painter of his day. The Stonemason’s Yard is one of his early paintings and is different from many of his other work as it depicts a scene of daily life rather than his celebrated views of Venice’s Grand Canal, regattas and festival days."

The UK is understood to be considering tasking troops with driving trucks via an American-built floating pier onto a beach in Gaza. Ex-Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said such a move would be ""unwise"" and urged the government to rule it out. Defence Minister Leo Docherty said he would not comment on speculation. The US military is building a large floating causeway off the coast of Gaza to help deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the area. In a briefing to journalists, a senior US military official said American troops would not take the aid ashore and that this role would be carried out by a ""significant partner"". He confirmed the job would be carried out by another nation rather than a private military company. The official said a ""third party"" would be driving trucks down the pier but refused to name who that would be. The Ministry of Defence has declined to comment on suggestions the third party could be UK forces. One UK source told the BBC nothing had been decided but there was a debate going on about ""do we put wet boots on the beach, do we drive trucks onto the pier?"" On Monday, Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey used an urgent question in Parliament to ask the minister if he could confirm ""weekend reports that UK troops could be deployed to deliver aid on the ground in Gaza"". ""How will the defence secretary report to this house and ensure that Parliament has a say on any such deployment?"" Mr Docherty said the government was ""not going to comment on the speculation that there might be a ground role for UK forces"". Tory MP Sir Julian Lewis, chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it would be a ""completely insane idea"" and argued a better option would be for ""moderate Arab neighbouring states"" to distribute the aid. Defence Committee Chair Sir Jeremy Quin said he understood the minister could not comment but warned that ""some of the best laid, best intentioned of plans can run into problems"". He sought assurances that the UK would only contemplate ""UK boots on the pier"" if ""appropriate"" protection was in place. The Liberal Democrat's defence spokesperson Richard Foord said that if UK troops were deployed in Gaza, MPs should first be given a debate and vote on the subject. Former Labour leader - now an independent MP - Jeremy Corbyn asked the government to assure MPs the government will ""not be deploying British troops anywhere on the ground in Gaza or the West Bank or any other part of the region"". US defence officials say the pier into Gaza would be ""several hundred meters long"" and could ultimately enable up to 150 trucks of aid, or two million meals, to be deliver per day. More than 1,000 US troops are expected to be involved in building the infrastructure, expected to be completed by early May. During construction, the American soldiers and sailors will live and sleep aboard the British naval vessel, the RFA Cardigan Bay. The UN has warned famine is ""almost inevitable"" in Gaza without urgent action. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began on 7 October. The  Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched the offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 253 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies."

Barabanov has written extensively about Russia's war in Ukraine and the Wagner mercenary group. The BBC condemned the ministry's move against him. ""The BBC strongly rejects the decision,"" a BBC statement said. The ""foreign agent"" label has very negative connotations in Russia. The government has used it to marginalise not only critics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but also voices challenging other Kremlin policies, including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups. One of Russia's most popular novelists - Boris Akunin - was put on the list in January. He is a long-standing critic of President Vladimir Putin. The term ""foreign agent"" recalls the Soviet-era campaign against ""enemies of the people"". ""Foreign agents"" have to identify themselves as such on social media and in other publications, and face burdensome financial reporting requirements. Both Barabanov and Kazantseva are now living abroad. Kazantseva signed an open letter from Russian scientists and science journalists demanding that Russian troops withdraw from Ukraine. She left Russia in January, saying she was being harassed by pro-war figures and seeing her lectures and book presentations cancelled. The justice ministry accused Barabanov - now based in Latvia - of ""spreading false information"" about Russian government decisions and policies, and of opposing the war in Ukraine. The BBC statement condemned the move, stressing that ""the BBC has a global reputation as a trusted and independent source of news"". It went on: ""BBC News Russian has been a vital source of accurate and impartial news to Russian-speakers for 80 years.

Official figures revealed the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 1.6%, far below expectations and the growth seen in the final months of 2023. Meanwhile, inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has increased. At the start of the year, experts had been forecasting a series of interest rate cuts in the US. However, inflation is yet to fall back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and on Thursday, figures from the US Department of Commerce showed that inflation increased by 3.4% in the first three months of 2024. This is compared to an increase of 1.8% in the final three months of 2023. Raising interest rates makes borrowing - for things such as loans and mortgages - more expensive and theoretically is meant to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand. However, US inflation has not fallen back as quickly as expected. At the same time, economic growth - measured as gross domestic product (GDP) - has slowed from 3.4% growth in the final three months of last year to 1.6%. Economists had been expected it to decelerate but only to 2.4%. Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch, the credit rating agency, said: ""The hot inflation print is the real story in this report. ""If growth continues to slowly decelerate, but inflation strongly takes off again in the wrong direction, the expectation of a Fed interest rate cut in 2024 is starting to look increasingly more out of reach."" The key US interest rate is between 5.25% to 5.5% - the highest level in more than 20 years. Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital in London, said the US Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, was ""now finding itself caught between a rock and a hard place"". ""The growth numbers suggest monetary policy has worked its magic and the Fed's foot on the monetary brake can be eased somewhat,"" he said. ""But the inflation figures suggest otherwise, and potentially even point to the need for a further tightening."" The 1.6% growth figure is the first estimate of GDP. A second reading, ""based on more complete source data"", will be released on 30 May. Nevertheless, the economy is a key issue as the US heads towards an election later this year."

Here's how that might look,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68778338,2024-04-13,0.12599616011083548,Scandal,False,Biodiversity loss,"The former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command has warned that Ukraine could face defeat by Russia in 2024. General Sir Richard Barrons has told the BBC there is ""a serious risk"" of Ukraine losing the war this year. The reason, he says, is ""because Ukraine may come to feel it can't win"". ""And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die any longer, just to defend the indefensible?"" Ukraine is not yet at that point. But its forces are running critically low on ammunition, troops and air defences. Its much-heralded counter-offensive last year failed to dislodge the Russians from ground they had seized and now Moscow is gearing up for a summer offensive. So what will that look like and what are its likely strategic objectives? ""The shape of the Russian offensive that's going to come is pretty clear,"" says Gen Barrons. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people reinforced by the use of newish weapons."" These include the FAB glide bomb, an adapted Soviet-era ""dumb bomb"" fitted with fins, GPS guidance and 1500kg of high explosive, that is wreaking havoc on Ukrainian defences. ""At some point this summer,"" says Gen Barrons, ""we expect to see a major Russian offensive, with the intent of doing more than smash forward with small gains to perhaps try and break through the Ukrainian lines. ""And if that happens we would run the risk of Russian forces breaking through and then exploiting into areas of Ukraine where the Ukrainian armed forces cannot stop them."" But where? Last year the Russians knew exactly where Ukraine was likely to attack - from the direction of Zaporizhzhia south towards the Sea of Azov. They planned accordingly and successfully blunted Ukraine's advance. Now the boot is on the other foot as Russia masses its troops and keeps Kyiv guessing where it is going to attack next. ""One of the challenges the Ukrainians have,"" says Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow in land warfare at the Whitehall thinktank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), ""is that the Russians can choose where they commit their forces. ""It's a very long front line and the Ukrainians need to be able to defend all of it."" Which, of course, they cannot. ""The Ukrainian military will lose ground,"" says Dr Watling. ""The question is: how much and which population centres are going to be affected?"" It is quite possible that Russia's General Staff have yet to go firm on which direction to designate as their main effort. But it is possible to broadly break down their various options into three broad locations. ""Kharkiv,"" says Dr Watling, ""is certainly vulnerable."" As Ukraine's second city, situated perilously close to the Russian border, Kharkiv is a tempting goal for Moscow. It is currently being pummelled daily with Russian missile strikes, with Ukraine unable to field sufficient air defences to ward off the lethal mix of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles aimed in its direction. ""I think the offensive this year will have breaking out of the Donbas as its first objective,"" adds Gen Barrons, ""and their eye will be on Kharkiv which is 29km [18 miles] or so from the Russian border, a major prize."" Could Ukraine still function as a viable entity if Kharkiv were to fall? Yes, say analysts, but it would be a catastrophic blow to both its morale and its economy. The area of eastern Ukraine known collectively as the Donbas has been at war since 2014, when Moscow-backed separatists declared themselves ""people's republics"". In 2022 Russia illegally annexed the two Donbas oblasts, or provinces, of Donetsk and Luhansk. This is where most of the fighting on land has been taking place over the past 18 months. Ukraine has, controversially, expended enormous efforts, in both manpower and resources, in trying to hold on to first the town of Bakhmut, and then Avdiivka. It has lost both, as well as some of its best fighting troops, in the attempt. Kyiv has countered that its resistance has inflicted disproportionately high casualties on the Russians. That is true, with the battlefield in these places being dubbed ""the meat grinder"". But Moscow has plenty more troops to throw into the fight - and Ukraine does not. The Commander of US Forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, has warned that unless the US rushes significantly more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine then its forces will be outgunned on the battlefield by ten to one. Mass matters. The Russian army's tactics, leadership and equipment may be inferior to Ukraine's, but it has such superiority in numbers, especially artillery, that if it does nothing else this year, its default option will be to keep pushing Ukraine's forces back in a westward direction, taking village after village. This, too, is a tempting prize for Moscow. The southern Ukrainian city of more than 700,000 (in peacetime) sits dangerously close to the Russian front lines. It is also something of a thorn in Russia's side given that it is the capital of an oblast of the same name that Russia has illegally annexed, and yet the city is still living freely in Ukrainian hands. But the formidable defences that Russia built south of Zaporizhzhia last year, in the correct expectation of a Ukrainian attack, would now complicate a Russian advance from there. The so-called Surovikin Line, consisting of triple layers of defences, is laced with the largest, most densely packed minefield in the world. Russia could partially dismantle this but its preparations would probably be detected. Russia's strategic objective this year may not even be territorial. It could simply be to crush Ukraine's fighting spirit and convince its Western backers that this war is a lost cause. Dr Jack Watling believes the Russian objective is ""to try to generate a sense of hopelessness"". ""This [Russian] offensive will not decisively end the conflict, irrespective of how it goes for either side,"" he says. Gen Barrons is also sceptical that, despite the dire situation Ukraine now finds itself in, Russia will automatically drive home its advantage with a decisive advance. ""I think the most likely outcome is that Russia will have made gains, but will not have managed to break through. ""It will not have forces that are big enough or good enough to punch all the way through to the river [Dnipro]... but the war will have turned in Russia's favour."" One thing is certain: Russia's President Vladimir Putin has no intention of giving up on his assault on Ukraine. He is like a poker player gambling all his chips on a win.

The Israeli military said troops had killed Hamas fighters in eastern Rafah as part of a ""precise"" counterterrorism operation. Hamas also reported battles. Earlier, the military said lorries had reached Kerem Shalom, which was closed after a Hamas rocket attack on Sunday. But the UN says no supplies have passed through the crossing yet. The US said that while the crossing was open again, aid could not get through ""because of logistical and security concerns"" on the ground. The UN had expressed alarm on Tuesday over what it called Israel's ""choking-off"" of Gaza's two main aid arteries, after Israeli troops took full control of the Palestinian side of the nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt . The closing of the Rafah crossing is of particular concern because of the consequences for fuel deliveries - the UN says all of its fuel enters there. ""Without fuel, trucks cannot move critical humanitarian assistance, water pumps will stop functioning and the remaining hospitals will shut down,"" Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, wrote on social media on Wednesday. World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that hospitals in the south of Gaza had only three days of fuel left. Plumes of smoke from Israeli air strikes were seen over Rafah and heavy gunfire was heard on Wednesday, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops were continuing a limited offensive in eastern areas. Residents of Rafah reported intense bombardment overnight and video footage on Wednesday morning showed people searching through the rubble of a building destroyed in one of the strikes. ""We are in a safe area according to the army's map - an area without operations,"" neighbour Reda al-Najili told Reuters news agency. ""We were sitting when suddenly the explosion happened. Our neighbour's house was gone, and our house was all damaged internally. In the house there are only civilians. Women died. Those who were injured were all children."" Palestinian medics also said seven members of one family, including five children, were killed in an overnight strike on a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north of the territory. An IDF statement issued on Wednesday morning said they had ""eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations"" during several encounters over the previous day. They were also carrying out raids on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, it added. The IDF also said aircraft had struck more than 100 ""terror targets"" throughout Gaza over the same period. Seven months into its war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking Rafah. But with more than a million displaced Palestinians taking refuge there from the fighting elsewhere, the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could have devastating humanitarian consequences. Negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have resumed in Cairo, with the US saying it believes a revised Hamas proposal could lead to a breakthrough. The Israeli military played down the significance of the US government's decision to halt a shipment of powerful bombs over concerns that Israel was about to launch a major offensive on Rafah city. However, US President Joe Biden later warned that the US would stop supplying some weapons if Israel launched a major ground operation in Rafah . The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people in a number of eastern neighbourhoods and told them they will find field hospitals, tents and aid in an ""expanded humanitarian area"", which stretches north from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah. Meanwhile, the director general of the World Health Organization said one of the three hospitals in Rafah, al-Najjar, was ""no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in its vicinity and the military operation in Rafah"". Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also warned that the partially functioning Kuwaiti and Emirati hospitals would soon run out of fuel unless the UN received a delivery. ""Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt,"" he added. The WHO has also said the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, where critical patients from Rafah are referred, may also become unreachable. A displaced man sheltering at the hospital told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme that life was very difficult for him. ""I suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis - a matter which means the displacement causes a great deal of suffering for me,"" he said. ""We hope to return to our land in Gaza and that everyone will set up a tent in the place of his home and settle back there."" On Wednesday morning, the IDF announced the reopening of Kerem Shalom for humanitarian aid. ""Trucks from Egypt carrying humanitarian aid, including food, water, shelter equipment, medicine and medical equipment donated by the international community are already arriving at the crossing,"" it said. ""After a thorough security inspection by the security personnel... the equipment will be transferred to the Gazan side of the crossing."" The military also said the recently reopened Erez crossing with northern Gaza was continuing to operate. However, the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which is the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza - reported that it had not received any Gaza aid via Kerem Shalom or Rafah, which remains closed. ""We're not receiving any aid into the Gaza Strip, the Rafah crossing area has ongoing military operations - there have been continued bombardments in this area throughout the day,"" said Scott Anderson, senior deputy director of Unrwa affairs in Gaza. ""No fuel or aid has entered into Gaza Strip and this is disastrous for the humanitarian response."" An Israeli government spokesman disputed Unrwa's assertion and insisted aid was going through Kerem Shalom. ""It is open and I would ask the UN why, day in and day out, there is so much surplus on the Gaza side of Kerem Shalom that is not being distributed,"" Avi Hyman told a briefing. Kerem Shalom is the key entry point for aid into Gaza, but Israel closed it on Sunday after four Israeli soldiers were killed by rockets launched by Hamas from the area of the Rafah crossing , according to the Israeli military. Another six projectiles were fired at Kerem Shalom from the Rafah area on Tuesday, but no casualties were reported. The second attack happened hours after Israeli tanks rolled into the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing. UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was ""disturbed and distressed"" by the Israeli military activity in Rafah. He also warned that the closure of both Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings was ""especially damaging to an already dire humanitarian situation"" and demanded that they be reopened immediately. Mr Guterres urged Israel and Hamas to ""spare no effort"" to agree a ceasefire, warning that the fate of the entire region was facing a ""decisive moment"". On Monday, Israel declared that a three-phase proposal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages approved by Hamas was unacceptable. The White House spokesman, John Kirby, said a revised text Hamas had since put forward suggested remaining gaps could ""absolutely be closed"". Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. More than 34,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead."

The German tennis player was declared bankrupt in June 2017, owing creditors almost £50m. The High Court was told he still owed about £42m - but lawyers for Becker said the 56-year-old had reached a settlement agreement with the trustees appointed to oversee his finances. They said Becker, who was jailed in 2022 for hiding £2.5m in assets to avoid paying debts, will provide a ""substantial sum"" into the bankruptcy estate. Becker was catapulted to stardom, aged 17, in 1985 when he became the youngest singles male player to win the Wimbledon Championships. He went on to win a further two Wimbledon titles, two Australian Opens and the US Open. After retiring from tennis in 1999, he commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC and turned his hand to coaching, working with Novak Djokovic. He moved to London in 2012, and his bankruptcy stemmed from an unpaid loan of more than £3m on a luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain. Although bankruptcy orders end after a year in England and Wales, a judge suspended the automatic discharge of the order in 2018 because Becker was ""failing to comply with his obligations"". Lawyers for Becker last month asked a judge to lift the suspension saying he had done ""the best possible he is capable of doing"". Giving written reasons for his decision , Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Nicholas Briggs said said it would be ""perverse"" not to lift the suspension now. He said: ""On the spectrum of bankrupts who range from 'difficult as possible and doing everything to frustrate the trustee's inquiries' to 'co-operative, providing information and delivering up assets', Mr Becker clearly falls on the right side of the line."" The judge said an ""unresolved matter"" was the location of some of Becker's trophies that are missing. He noted Becker has no further information relating to the whereabouts of the trophies but did not object them being minted or monetised. The judge said: ""As the joint trustees are concerned to realise and distribute assets this offer provides a commercial outcome."" Louis Doyle KC for Becker told the court the settlement agreement ""affects a compromise of all outstanding matters in the bankruptcy although that is predicated on Mr Becker making payment which will have the effect of providing a substantial sum into the bankruptcy estate"". He said the resolution with the trustees includes the ""outstanding trophies"" and that Becker ""can't do more than he has done to bring us to this point"". Becker was jailed for two-and-a-half years in April 2022 at Southwark Crown Court  after being found guilty of four offences. He was acquitted of 25 other charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career."

It caps a difficult period for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, which - faced with falling sales - has announced  thousands of job cuts. Boss Elon Musk remains bullish about its prospects, telling investors the launch of new models would be brought forward. Its share price has risen but analysts say it continues to face significant challenges, including from lower-cost rivals. The company has suffered from falling demand and competition from cheaper Chinese imports which has led its stock price to collapse by 43% over 2024. Figures for the first quarter of 2024 revealed revenues of $21.3bn, down on analysts' predictions of just over $22bn. But the decision by Tesla to bring forward the launch of new models from the second half of 2025 boosted its shares by nearly 12.5% in after-hours trading. It did not reveal pricing details for the new vehicles. However Mr Musk made clear he also grander ambitions, touting Tesla's AI credentials and plans for self-driving vehicles - even going as far as to say considering it to be just a car company was the ""wrong framework."" ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor,"" he said. Such sentiments have been questioned by analysts though, with Deutsche Bank saying driverless cars face ""technological, regulatory and operational challenges."" Some investors have called for the company to instead focus on releasing a lower price, mass-market EV. However, Tesla has already been on a charm offensive, trying to win over new customers by dropping its prices in a series of markets in the face of falling sales. It also said its situation was not unique. ""Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs,"" it said. Despite plans to bring forward new models originally planned for next year the firm is cutting its workforce. Tesla said it would lose 3,332 jobs in California and 2,688 positions in Texas, starting mid-June. The cuts in Texas represent 12% of Tesla's total workforce of almost 23,000 in the area where its gigafactory and headquarters are located. However, Mr Musk sought to downplay the move. ""Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California!"" he said in a post on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. Another 285 jobs will be lost in New York. Tesla's total workforce stood at more than 140,000 late last year, up from around 100,000 at the end of 2021, according to the company's filings with US regulators.  The car firm is also facing other issues, with a struggle over Mr Musk's compensation still raging on. On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge. The judge found Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the firm by awarding Mr Musk the pay-out. Due to the fall in Tesla's stock value, the compensation package is now estimated to be around $10bn less - but still greater than the GDP of many countries. In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday ."

The piece will be on display from Friday 10 May to Tuesday 10 September in Cambridge in celebration of the National Gallery's 200th birthday. He said: ""It's not just for people that already know and love Botticelli. We are showing a picture that can really make it about them but also about now."" This is the first time in 150 years since its acquisition in 1874, that the painting has left the National Gallery and will be seen by new audiences outside of London. Mr Syson said: ""I used to work at the National Gallery… for me this is something of a reunion which for me makes it a particularly nice part of the story. ""It gives the opportunity for museums across the country to give a new context, ask new questions bring new audiences and visitors to see works that are some of the most celebrated in the world."" He said the mystery and beauty of the painting was as ""compelling as any great poem"". ""It's as close to a poem in paint as you can get… like lots of poetry it doesn’t tell one clear story, it suggests all sorts of possibilities,"" he said. The painting is one of 12 paintings from the National Gallery's collection to go on display at museums and galleries across the United Kingdom.

The campaign is a response to the Slovak cabinet's refusal to join an initiative by the Czech government to buy up hundreds of thousands of shells for the Ukrainian armed forces. ""We have to drive Putin out of Ukraine. We have to defeat him,"" said Otto Simko, a Holocaust survivor and veteran of the 1944 Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis. Aged 99, he helped kickstart the campaign to challenge the government's policy. ""I lived through the Second World War. I fought in it. I can tell you there was no point negotiating with Hitler and there is no point negotiating with Putin,"" Simko told the BBC from Bratislava. It was a random conversation the Slovak veteran had with a journalist and a philosopher that led to the idea of crowdfunding Slovak help for Kyiv. In essence it allows Slovaks to bypass the populist-nationalist government of Robert Fico, who came to power in October pledging not to send ""one more round of ammunition"" to Ukraine. For months Ukrainian forces have struggled to defend their front lines from the Russian advance because of a shortage of shells, rockets and air defences. But Mr Fico has flatly refused to join about 20 countries that have signed up to the Czech operation to procure large quantities of artillery ammunition on the global arms market. The Slovak prime minister says the West's policy of arming Ukraine is only prolonging the conflict, and Kyiv should instead lay down its arms and sue for peace with Moscow. The crowdfunding campaign has provided an outlet for those Slovaks who do not agree with him. By Friday afternoon, more than 32,000 people had donated more than €2m since it launched on Tuesday afternoon. The money will go directly to the Czech government's initiative. ""We're really pleasantly surprised at the huge force it's awoken,"" said Zuzana Izsakova from the ""Peace to Ukraine"" initiative, which is running the effort in conjunction with the Czech-based Endowment Fund for Ukraine. ""It's a sign of the resistance of Slovak society against the government and the foreign policy of Robert Fico,"" she told the BBC. The campaign, running under the slogan ""If The Government Won't - We Will"", would continue even now it had met its target, she said. So far Mr Fico has not commented publicly on the campaign. However, Defence Minister Robert Kalinak told the Markiza TV station that Slovakia was a democracy and people were free to do what they wanted. His government was working instead on providing Kyiv with assistance such as demining equipment, he said. The Czech ammunition initiative sees Prague acting as a middleman, combining extensive defence contacts dating back to the Cold War with money from EU and Nato partners to procure ammunition for Ukraine's shell-starved artillery batteries. The scheme has been lauded by allies including President Joe Biden, at a time when Ukraine military aid has been mired for months in Congressional bickering and the EU's own ammunition pledges have fallen far short. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on a visit to Washington this week his country had so far signed contracts for 180,000 rounds and was securing the purchase of 300,000 more, following substantial pledges of money from Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and others. The first shells would arrive in June, said Mr Fiala. However, the project is shrouded in strategic ambiguity, and other Czech officials have suggested tens of thousands have already arrived on the battlefield. It is also unclear which countries are providing the shells, with unconfirmed claims that some of them enjoy friendly relations with Moscow. The Czech government says up to 1.5 million rounds could be available on the global market if the funds can be secured. Otto Simko said he had not hesitated to dip into his pension to help fund what he said was Ukraine's battle against totalitarianism. ""Remember [Neville] Chamberlain. His idea that offering Hitler the Sudetenland would bring peace - it turned out to be a complete illusion,"" he told the BBC. ""Our government is doing exactly the same. Give him the Donbas, just as long as there is peace. Give him Crimea, just as long as there is peace. It's a complete illusion,"" he went on. ""If we don't defeat Putin he will be a threat. Not for the two or three years that I have left on this Earth, but to my grandchildren and great-grandchildren, to Slovakia, and the whole world."""

The symphony, widely regarded as one of the great masterpieces of Western classical music and culminating in the Ode to Joy, was first performed in 1824 in Vienna, where the German composer lived and worked for most of his life. Now the city is celebrating with a series of performances of the symphony, notably by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by famed Italian Riccardo Muti. “It's the whole world to us to be able to sing this wonderful message of love,” Heidrun Irene Mittermair, an alto in the Vienna Singverein Choir, told the BBC. “You're lifted up at the end, when you're singing.” Heidrun, like the rest of the singers in the Singverein Choir, is not a professional musician - she’s a schoolteacher. But her choir sings at Vienna’s famous Musikverein Concert hall, with the Vienna Philharmonic, one of the world’s finest orchestras. Over the past few days, the choir has been singing the stirring Ode to Joy, the choral finale of Beethoven’s Ninth. Based on a poem by Friedrich von Schiller, it embraces a vision of universal brotherhood. The musicologist Otto Biba said the symphony was revolutionary, partly because it culminated with singing. “It was a symphony, but with something new in the fourth movement. There was a choir on the stage and the soloists were starting to sing,"" he said. ""There were so many new details. It was very difficult for the musicians, and very experimental.” “Beethoven opened the door to the future. It's a work left by Beethoven for the next generation,” Mr Biba said. Elke Manner-Prochart, a mezzo soprano who also sings in the choir, said it was challenging to perform. “We have three movements to be like an audience, but not as relaxed as the audience,"" she says. ""At the beginning of the fourth movement the heart begins to beat and we have to concentrate. And then it's a challenge, because we have, in a very short time... to give them all the emotions. It's not so easy.” The symphony was first performed at the court theatre, the Kärntnertortheater, in Vienna in 1824. Beethoven himself was one of the conductors, despite his increasing loss of hearing. In the orchestra were musicians who would later go on to become founding members of the Vienna Philharmonic. Daniel Froschauer, first violinist and Chairman of the Board of the Vienna Philharmonic, says the piece is part of the orchestra’s history. “It’s part of our DNA, a unique piece,” he told the BBC. “It's an outcry for peace. It's an outcry for unification, it's an outcry for brotherhood, and obviously, it's also the European Anthem,” he said. “It takes something out of you to play it. Beethoven challenges you, there's no question. At the beginning, for example, you don't know whether you're in D minor or major, it's not declared. It just immediately takes you in a different cosmos.” Heidrun Irene Mittermair says that, for her, the greatness of the symphony lies in the way it moves “from the darkness to the light”. “When you hear the violins or the basses towards the end, when the choir is starting, when the soloists are singing, everything is like exploding in joy, exploding in light and happiness, so that not one bit of this darkness is here any longer,” she said. “I think Beethoven had a lot of darkness in his life. And I think with this Ninth Symphony, he overcame it.”"

Mr Suleyman currently heads start-up Inflection AI, but is best known for co-founding AI firm DeepMind. It was one of the UK's best known AI firms and was bought by Google in 2014. Mr Suleyman's move cements Microsoft's reputation as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), a field in which Google is appearing to struggle. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Suleyman said he was ""excited"" to take up his new position, adding that he would be taking several colleagues to Microsoft with him, including ""friend and long time collaborator"" Karén Simonyan as chief scientist. He said he would be ""leading all consumer AI products and research"", including the Copilot chatbot, Bing and Edge. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella described Mr Suleyman as a ""visionary, product maker, and builder of pioneering teams that go after bold missions"". ""I am excited for them to contribute their knowledge, talent, and expertise to our consumer AI research and product making,"" he added. After leaving Google in 2022, Mr Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI, which has emerged as one of the most high-flying names in the generative AI race after raising $1.3bn from Microsoft and Nvidia last June. But taking up his latest position at Microsoft cements his respect in the field. Microsoft has invested billions into its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and recently in the French tech start-up Mistral AI. Microsoft said it would continue to build AI infrastructure and work in support of OpenAI's ""foundation model roadmap"". It is a different picture at Google currently though. There have been a number of issues around the tech giant's new AI-powered tool, Gemini, which refused to depict white people and changed the race of certain white historical figures. Google has apologised for ""inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions"", saying its attempts at creating a ""wide range"" of results missed the mark. If you want to know who's edging ahead on the AI race, look at the movement of its key players. Mustafa Suleyman's appointment nudges our imaginary swingometer firmly in the direction of the Seattle-based tech giant. The message could not be more clear: Microsoft""s long-term strategy of investing hugely in AI is paying off. Mr Suleyman left Google to launch his own company two years ago but until now he's remained a a high profile supporter of Team Google - or so it seemed. It must be infuriating for Google to watch. On paper Google has it all: money, expertise, infrastructure, data access and a huge user base. And yet somehow it has not found its groove, not helped by a series of PR missteps. Reports of a collaboration with its arch rival Apple, while unconfirmed by both parties, would give its AI brand Gemini a much-needed shot in the arm. But for now it finds itself increasingly sidelined in a race that, you would think, it began in pole position."

Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024 , after its membership was held up by both Turkey and Hungary. Turkey said Sweden had been giving refuge to members of groups such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which it considers a terrorist organisation. However, it decided to back Sweden's membership in January . Hungary's government was angry that Sweden had accused it of behaving undemocratically , but agreed to let it join in February. The addition of Sweden and Finland represents the biggest Nato expansion since the 1990s. The two countries contribute nearly 300,000 active and reserve troops to the alliance's ranks. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia also hope to join Nato. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said it is ""inevitable"" that Ukraine will become a member, but not until its war with Russia ends. President Zelensky has asked for Ukraine to be admitted as soon as possible afterwards. Since July 2023, the Nato-Ukraine Council has coordinated efforts to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its own territory. Nato asks member states to spend at least 2% of their national income on defence. The US spends nearly 3.5%, and several countries which border Russia - such as Poland and the Baltic Republics - also spend more than 2% on their armed forces. UK spending is currently just above 2%. In April 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said UK military spending would rise to 2.5% of national income by 2030 . Labour has previously said it is committed to a 2.5% target, when economic conditions allow. A number of countries, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain spent less than the 2% target in 2023 . Former US President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election, controversially said he would encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough on defence . Nato said there was an ""unprecedented rise"" in defence spending by several members in 2023 , and that 18 countries were expected to meet the 2% level in 2024. As a group, Nato has not sent weapons to Ukraine, but several individual member countries have. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey have provided anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones. The US and UK have also supplied long-range missiles. The US is allowing two Nato countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, to transfer US-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine , once pilots have been trained to fly them. Ukrainian media said the first planes could arrive in spring 2024 . However, Nato countries have not sent troops to Ukraine, and ruled out using their air forces to impose a no-fly zone over the country, because of fears such action could provoke a direct conflict with Russia. In 2023, Nato commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks in the Arctic and north Atlantic, central Europe, or the Mediterranean region. It also announced plans to increase the number of its troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000 . In addition, it has bolstered its defences on its eastern flank, bordering Russia, with eight battlegroups . Until the end of May, Nato is staging Steadfast Defender , one of its largest ever military exercises, involving 90,000 personnel from all Nato countries - including Sweden.

The fresh all-time high was driven by a weaker pound and easing tensions in the Middle East. The index closed on Monday at 8,023.87 points to mark the new record, surpassing its previous high of 8,012.53 in February last year. It was up 1.62% at its close, with retailers M&S, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Ocado among the big risers of the day. Shares have benefitted from a weaker pound because the index on the London Stock Exchange has many firms with big footprints overseas. A weak pound makes goods they export cheaper for foreign buyers and helps inflate the value of business done elsewhere. Rachel Winter, wealth manager at Killik & Co, said: ""The FTSE contains a large number of big international companies that earn their revenue in dollars and report their profits in sterling. ""The strength of the dollar is due to sticky inflation in the US, which means that US interest rates will remain higher for longer."" The pound was down 0.2% at $1.234 as a result, representing sterling's lowest point against the US currency for around five months. Axel Rudolph, senior market analyst at IG, said the ""de-escalation in the Middle East"" also played its part to propel the FTSE 100 to its new record. The index has been steadily ticking upwards in recent weeks on hopes the Bank of England will cut interest rates as inflation falls steadily back down to the central bank's 2% target rate. By making borrowing less expensive, lower interest rates discourage saving and can increase borrowing for home purchases and business investments, helping to breathe life back into the economy. It would be the first cut since March 2020. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""The Bank of England is now expected to start cutting rates before the US Federal Reserve sharpens its knife and that's led to divergent fortunes for the respective currencies."" He added that the ""favourite items on the menu to fill portfolios"" included Marks & Spencer, which was the recipient of a positive broker note, alongside Next and Sainsbury's. ""All three saw their ratings lifted from 'hold' to 'buy' as part of a review of the broader retail sector,"" he said."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking into the new breed of powerful AI tools - foundation models. They include text and image generators, such as ChatGPT. The CMA found an ""interconnected web"" of AI partnerships involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and chip-maker Nvidia. ""When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,"" Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA said. ""The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences."" Ms Cardell delivered the warning in a speech on Thursday in Washington. The CMA said that a small number of incumbent technology firms - already powerful in the most important digital markets - were also now taking the lead with foundation models. Trained on vast amounts of data, they underpin tools which are transforming workplaces and other aspects of modern life. The big tech firms have strong positions in terms of computing power, and access skilled employees, the CMA said, and can influence access to the market through apps and platforms. This could profoundly impact fair competition ""ultimately harming businesses and consumers, for example through reduced choice, lower quality, and higher prices, as well as stunting the flow of potentially unprecedented innovation and wider economic benefits from AI"", the CMA argued. The CMA said it wanted to learn from previous experience in digital markets where ""winner takes all dynamics"" led to the rise of a small number of powerful platforms. It said it was ""determined to apply the lessons of history"" at what it termed a ""pivotal moment in the emergence of a new, potentially transformative technology."" In a new paper , it found more than 90 connected investments and partnerships involving the same small number of tech giants. The watchdog is already undertaking a review of Microsoft's multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI. But it said it recognised ""the huge wealth of resources, expertise and innovation capability these large firms can bring to bear"".

Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi linked the media company to Hamas and said equipment was being confiscated in the northern Israeli city on Thursday morning. Al Jazeera has previously called claims it was a threat to Israeli security a ""dangerous and ridiculous lie"". The incident comes after Israeli police targeted one of the broadcaster's offices in occupied East Jerusalem on Sunday. Relations between the broadcaster and the Israeli government have long been tense but worsened dramatically following the outbreak of war in Gaza. With foreign journalists banned from entering the strip, Al Jazeera staff based in the area have been some of the only reporters able to cover the war on the ground. In April, the Israeli parliament approved a law giving the government the power to ban broadcasts of TV channels, including Al Jazeera. On Sunday, Israel's government moved to shut down the operations of the channel in the country, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying his cabinet had agreed to the closure while the war in Gaza is ongoing. On Thursday, Mr Karhi posted a picture on X, previously known as Twitter, appearing to show Israeli police outside a building, understood to house rented studios. He said he had ""ordered a raid"" on ""the studio in Nazareth where Al Jazeera reporters were broadcasting"". ""Currently, inspectors from the Ministry of Communications and Northern District Police Tactical Division are confiscating their equipment"", Mr Karhi added. ""Israel won't let Hamas broadcast from here."" The BBC has approached Al Jazeera for comment. The network has previously denied any link to Hamas and said on Sunday that it ""vehemently rejects the allegations presented by Israeli authorities suggesting professional media standards have been violated"". Police also raided the broadcaster's office at the Ambassador hotel in occupied East Jerusalem on Sunday. In a statement released the same day, Al Jazeera said it strongly condemned and denounced ""this criminal act that violates human rights and the basic right to access of information"". The broadcaster also accused Israel of ""ongoing suppression"" of free press, which ""stands in contravention of international and humanitarian law"" - as well as directly targeting and killing journalists. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. More than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has faced widespread condemnation for the number of journalists killed since the war began, but the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) says it only targets militants. Earlier on Thursday, heavy shelling was being reported in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, despite US President Joe Biden previously warning Israel against a major offensive there."

However Patriot systems for launching the missiles will not be sent, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Patriots were ""urgently"" needed to face a growing Russian air threat and ""can and should save lives right now"". On Saturday, Ukraine said Russia had carried out another massive air attack. Authorities in Kharkiv said a hospital was damaged. Energy facilities in three regions were attacked, Energy Minister German Galushchenko said. Russia attacked with cruise missiles, S-300 surface-to-air missiles and Iskander ballistic missiles, Ukraine said, adding that 21 were downed using aircraft, air defence systems and jamming. Ukraine claimed to have hit two Russian oil refineries across the border. Footage from one in the Russian region of Krasnodar appeared to have caused a large explosion, though local authorities denied significant damage. Russian authorities said on Saturday they had shot down some 68 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Speaking on Friday, Mr Austin told a news conference that the US was committing to its largest security assistance package to date and would ""move immediately"" to get the supplies to Ukraine. The US was using $6bn (£4.8bn) for this purpose, he said. A source confirmed to the BBC that the $6bn was part of a $60bn aid package signed into law by US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, which also includes $1bn in more immediate aid. The assistance would include air defence munitions, counter-drone systems and artillery ammunition but not Patriot missile systems. ""It's not just Patriots that they [the Ukrainians] need, they need other types of systems and interceptors as well,"" Mr Austin said. ""I would caution us all in terms of making Patriot the silver bullet."" Mr Austin added that he was confident that more of the missile systems would be made available for Kyiv soon. Conversations were ongoing with European partners, he said, to deliver additional capabilities. The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Brown, said the assistance should eliminate the Ukrainians' need to ration shells on the frontline. Some of the latest funding would also go to building up Ukraine's own defence industry, so that it can start manufacturing more of the ammunition it desperately needs. Mr Austin said Russia had already increased domestic production of artillery ammunition and other weapons - as well as being propped up by supplies from Iran and North Korea. ""Understand what's at stake for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the United States,"" he said. ""If Putin prevails in Ukraine - Europe would face a security threat it hasn't seen in a lifetime. Russia will not stop in Ukraine."" Asked whether the US aid would protect Ukrainian forces, Mr Austin said that the commitment was ""material, real, and substantial"" although ""not instantaneous"". ""It's going to take some time to get it in there and distribute. The Ukrainians were able to hold - with this capability, they can do a lot better."" The defence secretary's words came as Ukraine warned on Friday that Russia was ramping up attacks on its railways. A Ukrainian security source told the AFP news agency that Moscow wanted to damage Ukrainian railway infrastructure to ""paralyse deliveries and movement of military cargo"". Ukraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. Germany has already promised an extra Patriot system - and its defence and foreign ministers appealed to their European counterparts earlier this month to respond urgently. Greece has stocks of Patriots and S-300s but said none could be spared. ""We explained why we cannot do it,"" Greek  Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis told Skai TV. His said his country's air defences were ""critical systems for the protection of Greek air space"". According to reports, Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system. Recent months have seen Kyiv step up its calls for Western assistance as its stocks of ammunition are depleted and Russia makes steady gains. Ukrainian officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory."

The move marks a fall from grace for a company that became one of the darlings of the pandemic, when car buyers were forced to make their purchases online. The firm was launched in 2018 by Alex Chesterman, who also founded the property website Zoopla and LoveFilm, a predecessor of Netflix. Its popularity during lockdown meant that when it listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021 it was valued at $7bn (£5bn). That has now dropped to just $30m. Cazoo's filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission means it must find a buyer or appoint administrators within 10 days. It came shortly after the company admitted it was struggling to raise money from investors, and said it would miss the deadline to file its annual accounts. In March, Cazoo said it had sold off its remaining stock and switched to an online marketplace model, allowing car dealers to list their own stock on its platform. It also wound down its European business. Despite its valuation in 2021, it has never made a profit. In 2022 its losses rose to £704m from £544m the year before, and in December it restructured $630m of debt . It said it had sold 120,000 cars in the UK. The company said it had explored ""strategic alternatives"" to insolvency, including selling off parts of its business, but a buyer has so far not come forward. The number of people working for Cazoo has dropped sharply in recent years, from 4,500 in 2021 to about 1,000 today. In January 2023, Mr Chesterman stepped down as chief executive, becoming Cazoo’s chairman, then left the business altogether in December. His replacement as chief executive, Paul Whitehead, stepped down in March."

Europe's largest bank says it is in the process of finding a successor for 62-year-old Mr Quinn, who will stay in the role until a new chief executive is named. HSBC is considering candidates from both inside and outside the firm. It comes as the UK-based lender reported a 1.8% drop in profit for the first three months of 2024, compared to the same time last year. The company said that its pre-tax profit for the period came in at $12.7bn (£10bn), which was a little better than expected by market analysts. ""After an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life,” Mr Quinn said. Mr Quinn, who has worked at HSBC for 37 years, was first appointed as its chief executive on an interim basis in 2019, after his predecessor John Flint was ousted from the role. In March 2020, he took the reins of HSBC on a permanent basis. ""[Mr Quinn] has driven both our transformation strategy and created a simpler, more focused business that delivers higher returns,"" HSBC's chairman Mark Tucker said. Along with its quarterly results, the bank announced an interim payout to investors of $0.10 per share and said it would buy back up to $3bn of its shares. HSBC recently completed the sale of its operations in Canada and announced plans to do the same with its business in Argentina. The sales are part of efforts by the London-based bank to focus more on faster-growing markets in Asia. Shanti Kelemen, chief investment office at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme that it ""has probably been a very intense five years"" and that Mr Quinn ""has had a very long career"". She said that Mr Quinn had changed the shape of the bank during his time at the top, by such actions as selling HSBC's Argentina business, leaving Canada, and stepping up Asia operations. ""What he's done will probably reverberate and determine the path of their success for certainly several years to come,"" she added."

He said too many people had been ""denying, downplaying, rationalising the horrors of the Holocaust"". Mr Biden, 81, also condemned those who he said had forgotten the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. It was some of his most pointed criticism of Hamas since the attack. ""It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis,"" Mr Biden said. ""It was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten."" The president also criticised what he characterised as lawless behaviour and hateful rhetoric directed at Jewish people by some pro-Palestinian protesters on US university campuses in recent weeks. He said that ""scapegoating and demonising a minority"" threatens all minorities. The speech followed police interventions to dismantle several protest camps at colleges around the country. The demonstrators have faced complaints of intimidation and hate speech, which organisers have denied. At the same time they say they have been subject to Islamophobic and racist remarks by counter-demonstrators. Ahead of the speech, the White House announced new measures aimed at countering antisemitism, expanding on a national strategy first published in June. They include the creation of online resources ""to ensure that colleges and universities do a better job of protecting both Jewish students and all of their students"", as well as new guidance for schools. Since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas militants and the subsequent Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Jewish students in the US have reported an increase in antisemitic incidents. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish advocacy group, incidents spiked nationally in the final three months of 2023, and rose 321% on university campuses. One Jewish student at Columbia University - where a protest encampment sparked a wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations - previously told the BBC that she had been called a ""murderer"" and told to ""go back to Poland"". While the protesters have said they were demonstrating peacefully for a ceasefire in Gaza, several encampments in university buildings have been shut down by police over concerns about escalating violence. Others have been allowed to continue on the proviso they remain peaceful. In the six months since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, the Biden administration has attempted to balance support for Israel with addressing growing domestic dissent over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. But while some have accused Mr Biden of not doing enough to end the fighting, he has faced criticism from Republicans for publicly seeking to limit Israel's actions and not speaking about the protests sooner."

At the inauguration of a new Olympic swimming centre, reporters asked if he thought Russia was targeting the Games. ""Without a doubt,"" he said, ""including in the field of information. ""Every day (Russia) is putting out stories saying that we are unable to do this or that, so (the Games) would be at risk."" The French government says Russia has recently stepped up propaganda attacks on France, using fake accounts on social media to spread rumours and disinformation. It follows Mr Macron's switch to a more hard-line policy on the Ukraine war , to which he no longer refuses to rule out eventually sending French troops on the side of Kyiv. France believes Russian intelligence was behind the daubing of Israeli Stars of David on Paris walls after the October 7 Hamas attacks, in what was interpreted as a bid to stir up divisions in France. A network of Russian-created websites named Portal Kombat is accused of spreading made-up stories, such as claims that French mercenaries are already serving in Ukraine, or that Mr Macron cancelled a trip to Kyiv because of fears of an assassination attempt. After the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack near Moscow, the French and Russian defence ministers had a rare telephone exchange on Wednesday. According to Mr Macron, this was because France had intelligence information that could help the Russians know more about the alleged attackers, from the Afghan section of the Islamic State group. In his account of their conversation, French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said he told his counterpart Sergei Shoigu that France was concerned about Russian claims that Kyiv was behind the Crocus City Hall attack - claims for which France said there was no evidence. But in his account of the phone call, Mr Shoigu said: ""The Kyiv regime does nothing without the approval of its western minders. We hope that in the case (of the Crocus City Hall attack) the French secret services are not involved."" Asked about Mr Shoigu's remarks on Thursday, Mr Macron said they were ""bizarre and menacing … ridiculous."" The president confirmed for the first time that there are alternative plans for the Olympics opening ceremony in July, if the terrorist threat worsens. Currently the 26 July ceremony is supposed to take place on boats in the river Seine, with more than 300,000 people watching from the quays. However experts have warned that the occasion is highly vulnerable to terrorist attack. ""We will be ready,"" Mr Macron said. ""We are preparing several scenarios. If the threat were to evolve, if we considered that circumstances made it necessary, we have back-up scenarios."" Mr Macron also lent his support to the popular French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, whose name has been mentioned as a possible performer at the opening ceremony.  Critics on the hard-right of French politics say she would not be a good ambassador because the language of her songs is often crude and difficult to understand. ""She speaks to a good number of our fellow citizens and I believe she has every right to be at the opening or closing ceremonies of the Games,"" the president said."

Some users have received notifications saying their photo posts will be shared to a new ""TikTok Notes"" app unless they opt out. It is the latest example of social media firms imitating each others' products - including Instagram launching Reels, a TikTok-like video tool, in 2020. “The copycat phenomenon runs rampant across social media platforms"", Mike Proulx, a research director at analysis firm Forrester, told the BBC. When done well copycat features ""pay off"", he added, giving the example of when Instagram copied Snapchat with its ""Stories"" feature. However, he pointed out a similar move by Twitter ended in failure, so there was no guarantee of success. Instagram's focus on making Reels more central to app has previously frustrated some users. Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were among those who shared a petition calling out changes to the platform that seemed to promote Reels over other features of the app in 2022. Instagram U-turned on the changes after the backlash. TikTok says it has not finalised the design of the Notes app, nor has it confirmed a release date. But notifications received by some users suggest the app will let users upload or share photo posts - which are currently a feature of the TikTok app and let people post a series of images with sounds and filters. Screenshots of the notification showed a toggle on the notifications allowing TikTok users to opt out of having their photo posts shared to the app. Social media consultant Matt Navarra said a text or photo app might be a space where the majority of TikTok users who “lurk”, rather than post, would engage more. But he said he did not think another photo-sharing app was something social media users were “desperate” for. “We have plenty of them, so I don’t think there’s that demand out there necessarily,” he said. It comes at a difficult time for the company, with the US passing legislation that could see TikTok banned unless its Chinese owner sells it within six months of passing its law. ""Launching Notes as a separate app would be a departure in strategy for TikTok, which has previously incorporated new features directly into the core app, but it makes sense given the current regulatory and consumer scrutiny,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""There are few places left where it doesn’t have a stronghold, and photo-sharing is one,"" she added. Mike Proulx suggested the best way forward for TikTok might be to copy what Meta did with its Twitter rival, Threads, where it leaned heavily on the existing Instagram user base. ""But like Threads, the key will be creating a compelling enough experience to get them to stick around TikTok Notes beyond the initial curiosity factor,"" he added. “When social media features all start to become ubiquitous, what differentiates one social media platform from another narrows. It comes down to community, user experience, and, yes, algorithms.”"

Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are happening more frequently. These recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the spotlight. Downdetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea of the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently. More than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for WhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site. It says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV. Neither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their outages. But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen. ""The internet is not exactly getting more stable,"" he told the BBC. To understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet itself. Like software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. Introducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going wrong.

The other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down. Even severe weather, such as heatwaves , storms and natural disasters can affect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as servers, upon which online services rely. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and if just one of those goes wrong you can see problems,"" says Sam Kirkman of cyber-security firm NetSPI. Another issue is lots of firms have moved from managing their servers and infrastructure in-house to putting them on the cloud over the last decade. That has enabled those firms to do more ""faster than they ever could before"", Mr Kirkman told the BBC - but it also means a single outage in one place at the cloud service provider can ""cascade across a lot of the platforms, technologies and companies we use today"". Glitches for some of the biggest names in the industry - namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - have previously led to downtime for thousands of customers. Even those impacting smaller, yet heavily relied-upon providers like Fastly and Cloudflare have also had a knock-on effect for services. The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021 . Sudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages, especially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed periods like bank holidays or weekends. Theories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be speculation, Mr Smith says. But he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on them. ""Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a time where you don't want to be rolling out changes,"" he says. IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes. More widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online during outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users trying to get hold of it. Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called ""thundering herds"" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site. Underpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world: while the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its basic architecture is, often, quite antiquated. In other words, the modern internet relies ""on a fabric of really old technology"", says Mr Kirkman. He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021 . Misconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to the rest of the internet. And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses . Mr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be maintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take down entire platforms. It highlights what he says some might consider ""technical debt"" as an issue potentially affecting the whole of the internet. These problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services means they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent them. ""What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,"" says Mr Smith. ""I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to stay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to market,"" he adds."

Mr Pellegrini, 48, defeated the pro-Western Ivan Korčok, a former diplomat, with 53% of the vote. A former prime minister, he is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and shares the PM's dovish attitude towards Russia. Mr Fico and his allies now control Slovakia's parliament, government, and soon the president's office. Slovakia had been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies before Mr Fico came to power in October on a pledge to halt supplies of Slovak Army military stocks to Kyiv. With Mr Pellegrini replacing Mrs Caputova, Ukraine has now definitively lost a voice of support in an EU and Nato capital. Mr Fico has called for an end to Western military support for Ukraine, an immediate ceasefire, and peace talks with Moscow. He said recently President Vladimir Putin had been ""unfairly demonised"" and argued admitting Ukraine to Nato would mark the beginning of a third world war. Mr Pellegrini's campaign echoed some of that Moscow-friendly rhetoric, accusing Mr Korčok of being a warmonger who would send Slovak soldiers to fight in Ukraine - a constitutional power the president does not have. On Sunday Mr Pellegrini vowed ""to ensure that Slovakia remains on the side of peace and not on the side of war"". ""You don't have to worry that the Presidential Palace, as it has been for the last 10 years, will become a centre of oppositional, opportunistic power that will harm the government, that will harm the state abroad and will rejoice in the failures of the Slovak government,"" he said. Once Mrs Caputova steps down in June, there will no longer be any high-level official in Slovakia - a country which barely a year ago donated its entire fleet of MiG-29 aircraft to Ukraine - who unequivocally backs Kyiv's effort to defend its territory with force. Mr Korčok expressed his anger at Mr Pellegrini's campaign tactics, saying it was fear that decided the outcome of the election, and ""that fear was spread by those who are hidden in state positions"". He said of the result: ""It turns out that it is possible to become President of the Slovak Republic not only by spreading hatred, whipping up passions and pushing people to the barricades, but also by painting the opposite number, that is to say, me, as a candidate of war. I will not forget this."" The liberal pro-Western opposition also accuses Mr Pellegrini - as head of the coalition Hlas party and chairman of parliament - of remaining silent as Mr Fico took a wrecking ball to Slovakia's criminal justice system, notably abolishing the Special Prosecutor's Office, which was set up 20 years ago to probe serious corruption and economic crime. It had investigated a number of senior officials in Mr Fico's Smer party, and had been overseeing the prosecution of those believed to be responsible for the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova in 2018. The killings were a seismic event in Slovak politics. The fallout ended Mr Fico's second premiership in 2018 and led to the liberal, pro-Western Zuzana Caputova being elected president on a wave of popular anger at official corruption and organised crime. Robert Fico's government recently set its sights on Slovakia's public broadcaster, submitting plans to abolish the institution and replace it with one under virtual state control. Those plans were put on the back burner after a surprisingly poor showing from Peter Pellegrini in the first round of the presidential election two weeks ago. The opposition fears a reinvigorated Robert Fico will resubmit them - and they say President-elect Pellegrini is unlikely to stand in his way."

Reports suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be among them. The ICC, based in The Hague, has been investigating Israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of Hamas as well. It has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law. It has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony. Mr Netanyahu has called the prospect of senior Israel figures joining the wanted list ""an outrage of historic proportions"", accusing the ICC of attempting to paralyse Israel's ability to defend itself. But the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that, behind the scenes, such a scenario is being actively discussed. While the ICC has not confirmed the Israeli claims, when Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited Israel and the occupied West Bank last December his message was a clear one. The British barrister toured the sites of Hamas' attacks in Israeli villages close to the Gaza fence, which Hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 October. He also met political leaders, and travelled to Ramallah to speak to the families of Palestinian victims about their experiences in Gaza and the West Bank. He condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides, and promised to investigate. ""All actors must comply with international humanitarian law,"" he clarified in a statement at the time. ""If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act."" Mr Khan said the 7 October attacks - in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies - represented ""some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address"". In Israel's case, his concerns were twofold. He stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in Gaza according to ""clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict"". Israel has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment, although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties. The Hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began, and that many of that number are children. Mr Khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, with access to food, water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians ""without further delay, and at pace and at scale"". He also urged Hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive, after accusations by Israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid, stopping it from reaching the wider population. Israel isn't a member of the ICC and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it. But the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza after the Palestinians ratified its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, as the State of Palestine. No Western-style democracy has had an ICC arrest warrant issued for its leader before. If it happens to Mr Netanyahu, he'll be the first. Israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it. Michael Oren was Israel's ambassador to the United States between 2009 and 2013. He points to the recent case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza - an accusation Israel vehemently rejects. In January, the court issued an interim ruling that ordered Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive. ""Israel emerged from those proceedings relatively unscathed, but the fact that the proceedings were held at all meant that Israel had lost the battle,"" he told the BBC. ""They should not have been held at all, and certainly it's a blow to our international standing and our security. Because a country whose leaders are accused of presiding over war crimes, that country is more vulnerable than a country that isn't."" Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, another British barrister, led the prosecution of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). He points out that the actions of both sides in this conflict are within the ICC's focus. ""Any investigation will not just be the Israeli Defense Forces and political and military leadership but also Hamas,"" he told the BBC. ""It's to be hoped that alleged Hamas fighters and leaders are not all shot on sight, that they are detained and made available for trial by an international tribunal."" He also addressed suggestions that the ICC could come under political pressure to reconsider its decision-making. ""Governments around the world, particularly large and powerful governments, are there to protect their country's interests. ""So if they see a trial coming along, or an investigation... that would cause them as a country great reputational damage, and if they reckon they can interfere with the trial or the investigative or trial processes to save them from that reputational damage, then they'll do that, because they are acting in the interests of their country."" The timeframe for issuing warrants can vary, with weeks and even months sometimes elapsing between the point at which the ICC prosecutor requests it, and judges grant it. Sometimes the details can be kept confidential if it's deemed that making them public would lessen the prospect of an arrest. Such a move against Mr Netanyahu, his political colleagues or Israeli military commanders would have practical implications too. It would affect their ability to travel widely, as Rome Statute nations are obligated to hand over visiting individuals with outstanding warrants against them. However, some of those nations have ignored ICC warrants in recent years. Former Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren believes the eventual impact would be far wider, changing the narrative of Israeli society ""Generally, it responds to love. It doesn't respond to aggression. If you want to get concessions out of Israelis do not hit them over the head, embrace them,"" he said. ""All of these measures tend to move the political needle in this country rightward and not the other way. It would have a boomerang effect, and rather than opening pathways to possible diplomatic process it will likely constrict it."""

""To write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric,"" wrote the German theorist Theodor Adorno, suggesting, in his 1949 essay Cultural Criticism and Society, that artistic expression had been rendered inadequate as a tool to understand reality after the Holocaust. In her 1974 film The Night Porter, Italian director Liliana Cavani challenged this theory, taking it to its logical extreme. She used a concentration camp as the setting to explore a crazed sexual bond between an adolescent prisoner and an SS commandant, and how, years later, this psychological poison has pervaded their souls. Amid the furore after its release – which included intensely negative reviews from both sides of the Atlantic, and an attempted ban by the Italian ratings board – with typical nonchalance, Cavani told The New York Times : ""This is nothing compared to the numberless couples who tear each other apart psychologically."" Half a century on, however, does The Night Porter still seem like a provocation that plumbs the depths of bad taste? With the film's recent restoration and re-releases, as well as renewed conversations around cinematic depictions of the Holocaust, many have revisited the film and remain unimpressed by its content. Others are perhaps seeing the film more as Liliana Cavani originally intended: as an artistic reflection of how sexual obsession – in all its often-misplaced fervour – can be fascistic in its tunnel-visioned ferocity. Cavani herself put it more simply: "" love comes always with a price to pay "". The Night Porter is set in Vienna in 1957, where a former Nazi commandant, Max (Dirk Bogarde), works in an upmarket hotel. There, he clashes with former SS colleagues who are determined to purge themselves of any shame about their roles in the Final Solution and eliminate any surviving witnesses. Max, however, would rather forget his past and move on, living his life quietly, he says, ""as a church mouse"". His careful world is upended when Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), now married to an American composer, walks into his hotel lobby – the very woman he sexually abused while she was a prisoner in his camp, and with whom he entered into a sadomasochistic relationship. Reunited once more, their twisted folie à deux resumes and a fervent debasement begins – now, on both sides. As the daughter and granddaughter of committed anti-fascists, Cavani had spent the first portion of her career in the early 1960s creating documentaries about wartime fascism like History of the Third Reich (1962-1963) and Women of the Resistance (1965). During the making of the latter, one interviewee who was incarcerated in the Dachau concentration camp as a teenager confided that she kept returning there after the war. This idea of a prisoner returning to the scene of their torment fascinated Cavani, and the seed for The Night Porter was born. Like Luchino Visconti's The Damned (1969) and Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist (1970), The Night Porter has a heightened visual style that depicts fascism as an unnatural and uncanny ideology where sexual immorality thrives. As Teresa De Santis wrote in her 1976 essay, Cavani's Night Porter: A Woman's Film, ""highbrow critics [...] were quick to place Cavani's style in a smug fit between Visconti and Bertolucci, implying nothing but a competent imitation of her (male) masters"". But Cavani took Visconti and Bertolucci's visual depictions of Nazism and aberrant sexuality further, with skin-crawling images: the stark sight of stripped bodies in prison camps; of sallow, almost blue faces that are gaunt with hunger; of abrupt sexual violence, in which it is implied that the victim is enjoying themselves. These scenes are not attempts at realism, but knowingly contrived – Cavani intersperses them with scenes at an opera, both with the same harsh lighting, thick make-up and the impression of performance. As the titular night porter in hiding, Max is having to perform dual roles: as a debonair concierge, and as a participant in his SS friends' ""mock trial,"" which is designed to purge him of Nazi remorse. The only way he can escape from his mounting inner turmoil, though, is to fully cave into a psychological nadir: by regressing into petulant games with Lucia. As they restart their affair, eventually locking themselves into a dank apartment where they slowly starve, it is clear that Lucia's return represents his unsurvivable levels of guilt. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of reviews for The Night Porter – particularly in the US – were scathing. Roger Ebert dismissed it as being ""as nasty as it is lubricious, a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering"". Echoing this vitriol, The New York Times' Nora Sayres asked : ""Is this slab of opulent claptrap worth any serious consideration?"". Meanwhile in The New Yorker, Pauline Kael took the film as proof ""that women can make junk just as well as men"". This critical dismay was then manipulated by the film's marketing department, which took snippets of these negative reviews and used them to promote the film. ""What a kinky turn on!"" read one poster quote attributed to another New York Times writer, Vincent Canby, who – having used this line sarcastically – had in the same review called the film ""a piece of junk"". More like this: • The Russian box-office hit that beat the censors • The perils of being the world's most beautiful film star • 11 of the best films to watch in May The film's most enduring and memorable scene has also done it no favours: the sight of Charlotte Rampling with shorn hair, in a peaked cap, over-the-elbow leather gloves and suspenders barely covering her breasts, performing an eroticised cabaret number for a group of SS officers at the camp. This look became a defining image of the "" Nazi Chic "" phenomenon,  appropriated in culture and fashion among punk acts and beyond as an easy way to cause a stir. Reacting to the creeping sexualisation of fascism in the media in 1975, Susan Sontag wrote : ""Why the SS? Because the SS was the ideal incarnation of fascism's overt assertion of the righteousness of violence [...] they dramatised it by linking themselves to certain aesthetic standards. The SS was designed as an elite military community that would be not only supremely violent but also supremely beautiful."" Following accusations of sexualising Nazism and the manipulative marketing campaign, many dubbed The Night Porter as ""Nazisploitation"". Nazisploitation was a subgenre of exploitation films – the genre covers a wide gamut of films that are deliberately lurid, shocking and often low budget, with other subgenres including Blaxploitation or Ozsploitation. In Nazisploitation films, oftentimes they depicted Nazis committing sex crimes; famous examples include Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1975), Salon Kitty (1976) and Gestapo's Last Orgy (1977). The Night Porter is often grouped together with them, despite bearing little resemblance to these knowingly schlocky and quasi-pornographic works. For many, the depiction of eroticism and Nazism side-by-side was enough to remove any artistic merit. Seemingly agreeing, Linda Mizejewski argued in her 1992 book Fascism, Female Spectacle and the Makings of Sally Bowles that ""antifascist productions end up duplicating the fascist politics they strive to condemn, reproducing the homophobia, misogyny, fascination for spectacle"". However, there are a number of women who have recently come out in favour of The Night Porter's studied look at sexual frenzy. While it was previously difficult to get hold of a copy to watch, a new generation of critics and cinephiles have been able to see it more easily, thanks to a 2K remaster and re-release by the Criterion Collection in 2014 and a 4K Ultra-HD 2020 release by Cult Films . In 2014, Gaetana Marrone praised The Night Porter as being ""concerned with the thematisation of compulsive, repetitive desire and pleasure that exceed the logic of history"". For Marrone, the film is not designed to titillate the viewer; rather, ""games of erotic enslavement and domination reflect the paradoxical historical situation in which [Max and Lucia] reenact their love"". And while The Night Porter focuses on an inescapably controversial topic, ""the film's main provocation is to consider the peculiarities of trauma and how they manifest, particularly within some sadomasochistic sexual dynamics,"" film and culture writer Lillian Crawford tells the BBC. ""It is a nauseating melting pot of schadenfreude, Stockholm syndrome, Lolita-like obsession, and Nazi fetishism that threatens to tear Max and Lucia apart."" According to Crawford, it is the fact that Cavani dares to probe at these ideas without a care for good taste that lies at the heart of its controversy. ""The Night Porter proves that Nazi exploitation and sexual taboo is essential to understanding the manifestation of fascistic ideology, and for the film to have sustained that complexity into the present is in itself a form of success,"" she says. Anna Maria Pasetti, an Italian film festival programmer and member of the International Federation of Film Critics, tells the BBC that while ""there is no pleasure in watching it,"" it is nonetheless a story that ""needed a lot of courage to be written, directed and eventually acted, especially in a country – Italy – where the shadow of fascism was still so poignant. Not least considering that the director is a woman."" Beyond mere bravery, though, Pasetti agrees with Crawford, that ""controversies nourish how one can discuss a film, which encourages me to think of it as a success"". Their fellow critics seem to agree; in a 2019 poll run by BBC Culture to find the 100 greatest films directed by women , The Night Porter landed in a respectable 32nd position. Jane Campion, herself known for knotty and complex examinations of the intersection of danger and desire, and whose film The Piano topped the poll, described The Night Porter in 2008 as a film of ""extraordinary psychological perversity and truth [...] that persuades me that our lives are not logical but poetic and allegorical."" Fifty years on, and with distance from the Nazisploitation craze that quickly dissipated after the 1970s, there is a larger canon of Holocaust cinema with which to compare The Night Porter. While more recent reviews of the film remain mixed, they generally seem less shocked by the content than unimpressed with other aspects, such as improbable plot developments or pacing issues. In a tepid 2020 review, The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw called it ""contrived and unconvincing"", though he acknowledged that it ""does at least jolt us towards an acknowledgment of pure evil"". Similarly, Kim Newman, in Empire, described this ""once controversial"" film as suffering from ""a storyline as rambling and illogical as the behaviour of its peculiar characters"", ultimately being ""too protracted and pompous"". Looking at the canon as a whole, too, one might be hard stretched to find a Holocaust film that doesn't suffer from controversy. Writing in The Guardian, Jonathan Freedland argues that the Holocaust appeals to filmmakers as it ""seems to offer a shortcut to moral gravity, emotional depth and the highest possible stakes"", but that Holocaust films are ultimately dishonest, because ""whatever can be shown on screen will always be less hellish than the reality"". There is often debate about how best to portray the Holocaust in cinema, or whether it is even necessary at all; approaches vary, from in-your-face endeavours like The Grey Zone (2001) to tear-jerking affairs like The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and more oblique, art-house successes like The Zone of Interest (2023). Depending on who you ask, these films are always either too graphic, too sentimental, too cutesy, too bleak, or perhaps not bleak enough. According to Bradshaw, ""however bizarre, I think [The Night Porter] is far superior to sugary, sentimental and illiterate pictures such as Life Is Beautiful or Jojo Rabbit"". For Crawford, ""It is unconscionable to make cinematic entertainment out of Holocaustic imagery, especially for films like Schindler's List or Jojo Rabbit. But The Night Porter is not attempting to 'recreate' the Holocaust; it is, like The Zone of Interest, attempting to penetrate a more psychological, sexual component of Nazism and genocidal thought which requires a more abstract framing of the Holocaust. Indeed, a 'respectful' Holocaust film is one like Claude Lanzmann's Shoah, which does not attempt to show or reconstruct what happened at all. The Night Porter is by no means a 'respectful' or indeed a 'respectable' film, but its strength comes from probing an aspect of Nazi thinking which few filmmakers would dare to investigate. It is not comfortable or easy, and that is surely an essential quality of a Holocaust film."" Amidst this contemporary cultural conversation, The Night Porter may to some feel like less of a controversial work than others. For those that see its conflation of lust and fascist evil as repugnant, there are others who view it as an astute observation of the psychological violence that occurs in an environment, like a concentration camp, where there is total absence of reason. For Pasetti, ""nothing more than the pursuit of the 'real truth' should be the basis upon which to judge a good or respectful feature film about the Holocaust"". If this film's strange vision contains Cavani's truth, then, perhaps, viewers' continued unease can only be expected. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

About 100,000 people are being directed to head for an ""expanded humanitarian area"" in Khan Younis and al-Mawasi. After seven months of war, Israel says it must take Rafah to defeat Hamas. But the UN and US warn that an assault on the city, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, could have catastrophic consequences. A senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, told the Reuters news agency that the Israeli order was ""a dangerous escalation that will have consequences"". Israeli air strikes in Rafah reportedly killed at least 19 Palestinians overnight, after rockets launched from the area by Hamas fighters killed four Israeli soldiers at the nearby Kerem Shalom border crossing - the key entry point for humanitarian aid into Gaza. The crossing was closed following the attack. There have also been reports of Israeli attacks on Rafah, hours after the evacuation order was issued. Meanwhile, the latest efforts for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have stalled, with both Israel and Hamas saying they would not give ground on key demands. Hamas wants a permanent end to the war, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he cannot accept. Mediators said they were continuing their efforts. In an initial briefing to journalists on Monday morning, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani stressed that the operation planned in Rafah was of ""limited scope"". He said that no timeframe had been announced and that the evacuation affecting an estimated 100,000 people would be carried out in ""a gradual way"". The IDF is using text messages, flyers and social media to tell people to move. One of the Arabic flyers dropped by aircraft features a map that identifies nine area blocks in south-eastern Rafah, where the IDF says it will ""be operating against the terrorist organisations"". They include al-Shuka, al-Salam, al-Janina and al-Yarmouk, as well as farmland near Kerem Shalom. The flyer instructs residents of those areas to evacuate immediately and head towards an area stretching north along the Mediterranean coast from al-Mawasi - a thin strip of agricultural land that has long been an IDF-designated ""humanitarian zone"" - to Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah. The IDF said the expanded humanitarian area included ""field hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medication and additional supplies"". ""An ongoing situation assessment will guide the gradual movement of civilians in the specified areas, to the humanitarian area,"" it added. Such messages are unlikely to allay the fears of those living in the city that a wider offensive is on the cards. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which runs the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza, said the ""consequences would be devastating for 1.4 million people"" in Rafah. The organisation added in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that it would not evacuate and would maintain a presence in the city ""as long as possible and will continue providing life-saving aid to people"". Ghada el-Kurd, a Palestinian mother-of-two who has been displaced six times over the last four months, told the BBC that she was sheltering only 15 minutes away from one of the areas included in the evacuation order, but was staying put for now. ""I'm so confused, just to be honest. I have no place to go. This was the last place I know,"" she said. ""If I want to come back to Khan Younis, there is no place - it is all destroyed. [As for] areas of al-Mawasi, they are crowded and I cannot any more live inside a tent."" ""Regarding Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat [refugee camp], still there is a lot of air strikes there... and it is a very dangerous area."" James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, who was in Gaza last month, said families now had no choice but to head towards areas that were already overcrowded and lacked basic facilities. ""They will move because they will move or be bombed. But they will move to places where there is no water - not a little bit of water, but no water - and no sanitation,"" he told the BBC. For months, Mr Netanyahu has been insisting that victory against Hamas cannot be won without a full-scale offensive in Rafah. Israel says Rafah harbours four remaining Hamas battalions, amounting to thousands of fighters. The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called Monday's evacuation order ""unacceptable"". ""The EU, with the international community, can and must act to prevent such scenario,"" he wrote on X. US President Joe Biden spoke with Mr Netanyahu abut Rafah by phone on Monday. No details of the call have yet been released. Officials from Israel and its closest ally, the US, have been holding meetings to discuss alternative, more focused plans. It is not clear if the new evacuation orders are part of those. In Israel, some families of hostages expressed their fear about what a Rafah operation might mean for their loved ones. ""We are very much afraid that the IDF entering Rafah will risk the lives not only of innocent people, not only of soldiers, but also of some hostages,"" said Gil Dickmann, whose two cousins were taken hostage on 7 October, one of whom was released and the other remains in captivity. The current war began when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages. The Israeli response has seen intense bombardment of all parts of Gaza from the air and a ground invasion that has seen troops take control of most of the territory before withdrawing most troops. More than 34,735 Palestinians have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages remain unaccounted for in Gaza, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead."

Charles Lutyens was both an artist and art therapist in the 1970s and 1980s, so had access to psychiatric hospitals at a time when they were feared and stigmatised by many. His work led to him to create paintings studying the characters within them, who were often ignored or treated with disdain by the wider world. The free exhibition will open at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in Beckenham, south-east London, on 8 June. Born in 1933, Lutyens trained at various institutions and went on to create works like Angels of the Heavenly Host in St Paul's Church in Bow Common, one of the UK’s largest single-artist mosaics. However, it is the pieces he made during his time as an art therapist that are the focus of A World Apart: The Work of Charles Lutyens. Practised formally since the middle of the 20th Century, art therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its main mode of expression and communication. As a therapist in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Lutyens would create close observations of the characters he met, as well depicting as daily life within the institutions where he worked. Colin Gale, the museum's director, said that Lutyens had ""poured empathy for his subjects into his art through careful rendering and visual metaphor and has drawn on, and depicted, his own feelings. ""As well as documenting aspects of daily life in institutions, Lutyens’ work also comprises a poignant record of human emotion and experience.” The exhibition, based in the 1930s former administration building of Bethlem Royal Hospital, the world’s oldest psychiatric hospital, will run until 31 August.

The Kerem Shalom crossing was closed overnight by Israel following the strike. Subsequent Israeli strikes in the southern Gazan city of Rafah have reportedly killed at least 12 people. Israel's military said early on Monday it was urging Gazans sheltering in parts of Rafah to evacuate. It comes as talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of hostages have stalled. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said 10 projectiles had been fired from an area near the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza, about 3.6km (2.2 miles) from Kerem Shalom. Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility and said its target was a nearby Israeli army base. They were fired from a site some 350m from a civilian shelter, the IDF said It called the launches ""another clear example of the terrorist organisation's systematic exploitation of humanitarian facilities and spaces, and their continued use of the Gazan civilian population as human shields"". Hamas denies it uses civilians as human shields. The Israeli military confirmed a counter-strike in Rafah, saying it struck the launcher from which the projectiles were fired and a nearby military structure. There were two Israeli strikes on Sunday, killing at least 12 people according to Gaza health officials. The latest violence follows two days of talks with mediators in Cairo, Egypt. There has been little progress, with both Israel and Hamas saying they will not give ground on key demands, but discussions are expected to resume on Monday. Hamas said its delegation would travel to Qatar to consult with the group's leadership. CIA chief William Burns, who has also been involved in mediation efforts, has left the Egyptian capital for talks in Doha, according to reports. The truce proposal is believed to involve a 40-day pause in fighting, allowing the release of hostages in Gaza and a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Hamas said it viewed the current proposal in a ""positive light"", but the main sticking point appears to be whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. The group is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected that on Sunday. ""The state of Israel cannot accept this [Hamas's demands], we are not prepared to accept a situation in which the Hamas brigades come out of their bunkers, take control of Gaza again, rebuild their military infrastructure, and return to threatening the citizens of Israel in the settlements surrounding the southern mountains, in all parts of the country. ""This will be a terrible defeat for the state of Israel,"" he added. The war began after waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. The group is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western countries. During the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, more than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed and over 77,900 wounded, according to figures from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Netanyahu has faced pressure from within his far-right coalition to press ahead with the long-promised offensive in Gaza's southern-most city, Rafah, where an estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter after fleeing fighting in northern and central parts of the strip. The US is reluctant to back a military operation that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. Early on Monday, the IDF said it was encouraging residents in Rafah's eastern neighbourhoods to make their way toward an ""expanded humanitarian zone."" ""The expanded humanitarian zone includes field hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medicine and other supplies. ""In accordance with the approval of the government, an ongoing situation assessment will guide the gradual movement of civilians in the specified areas in eastern Rafah, to the humanitarian area,""  a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, read. Seven months into its offensive against Hamas, Israel has said that victory is impossible without taking Rafah. But with more than more than 1.4 million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, Western powers and neighbouring Egypt have raised fears that there could be high numbers of civilian casualties. Update 7 May 2024: The number of soldiers killed in the Hamas rocket attack has been updated in this article from three to four."

The implications are far bigger,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68933778,2024-05-04,0.1681111823789495,Scandal,False,Chemical leak,"On 2 January, a young Ukrainian weapons inspector, Khrystyna Kimachuk, got word that an unusual-looking missile had crashed into a building in the city of Kharkiv. She began calling her contacts in the Ukrainian military, desperate to get her hands on it. Within a week, she had the mangled debris splayed out in front of her at a secure location in the capital Kyiv. She began taking it apart and photographing every piece, including the screws and computer chips smaller than her fingernails. She could tell almost immediately this was not a Russian missile, but her challenge was to prove it. Buried amidst the mess of metal and spouting wires, Ms Kimachuk spotted a tiny character from the Korean alphabet. Then she came across a more telling detail. The number 112 had been stamped onto parts of the shell. This corresponds to the year 2023 in the North Korean calendar. She realised she was looking at the first piece of hard evidence that North Korean weapons were being used to attack her country. ""We'd heard they had delivered some weapons to Russia, but I could see it, touch it, investigate it, in a way no-one had been able to do before. This was very exciting"", she told me over the phone from Kyiv. Since then, the Ukrainian military says dozens of North Korean missiles have been fired by Russia into its territory. They have killed at least 24 people and injured more than 70. For all the recent talk of Kim Jong Un preparing to start a nuclear war, the more immediate threat is now North Korea's ability to fuel existing wars and feed global instability. Ms Kimachuk works for Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an organisation that retrieves weapons used in war, to work out how they were made. But it wasn't until after she had finished photographing the wreckage of the missile and her team analysed its hundreds of components, that the most jaw-dropping revelation came. It was bursting with the latest foreign technology. Most of the electronic parts had been manufactured in the US and Europe over the past few years. There was even a US computer chip made as recently as March 2023. This meant that North Korea had illicitly procured vital weapons components, snuck them into the country, assembled the missile, and shipped it to Russia in secret, where it had then been transported to the frontline and fired - all in a matter of months. ""This was the biggest surprise, that despite being under severe sanctions for almost two decades, North Korea is still managing to get its hands on all it needs to make its weapons, and with extraordinary speed,"" said Damien Spleeters, the deputy director at CAR. Over in London, Joseph Byrne, a North Korea expert at the defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), was equally stunned. ""I never thought I would see North Korean ballistic missiles being used to kill people on European soil,"" he said. He and his team at RUSI have been tracking the shipment of North Korean weapons to Russia ever since Mr Kim met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Russia in September of last year to strike a suspected arms deal. Using satellite imagery, they have been able to observe four Russian cargo ships shuttling back and forth between North Korea and a Russian military port, loaded with hundreds of containers at a time. In total RUSI estimates 7,000 containers have been sent, filled with more than a million ammunition shells and grad rockets - the sort that can be fired out of trucks in large volleys. Their assessments are backed up by intelligence from the US, UK and South Korea, though Russia and North Korea have denied the trade. ""These shells and rockets are some of the most sought-after things in the world today and are allowing Russia to keep pounding Ukrainian cities at a time when the US and Europe have been faltering over what weapons to contribute,"" Mr Byrne said. But it is the arrival of ballistic missiles on the battlefield that has concerned Mr Byrne and his colleagues the most, because of what they reveal about North Korea's weapons programme. Since the 1980s North Korea has sold its weapons abroad, largely to countries in the North Africa and the Middle East, including Libya, Syria and Iran. They have tended to be old, Soviet-style missiles with a poor reputation. There is evidence that Hamas fighters likely used some of Pyongyang's old rocket-propelled grenades in their attack last 7 October. But the missile fired on 2 January, that Ms Kimachuk took apart, was seemingly Pyongyang's most sophisticated short-range missile - the Hwasong 11 - capable of travelling up to 700km (435 miles). Although the Ukrainians have downplayed their accuracy, Dr Jeffrey Lewis, an expert in North Korean weapons and non-proliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, says they appear to be not much worse than the Russian missiles. The advantage of these missiles is that they are extremely cheap, explained Dr Lewis. This means you can buy more and fire more, in the hope of overwhelming air defences, which is exactly what the Russians appear to be doing. This then raises the question of how many of these missiles the North Koreans can produce. The South Korean government recently observed North Korea has sent 6,700 containers of munitions to Russia, it says that Pyongyang's weapons factories were operating at full-tilt, and Dr Lewis, who has been studying these factories through satellites, reckons they can churn out a few hundred a year. Still reeling from their discovery, Mr Spleeters and his team are now trying to work out how this is possible, given that companies are banned from selling parts to North Korea. Many of the computer chips that are integral to modern weapons, that guide them through the air to their intended targets, are the same chips that are used to power our phones, washing machines and cars, Mr Spleeters explained. These are being sold all over the world in staggering numbers. Manufacturers sell to distributors in their billions, who sell them on in their millions, meaning they often have no idea where their products end up. Even so, Mr Byrne was frustrated to learn how many components in the missile had come from the West. It proved that North Korea's procurement networks were more robust and effective than even he, who investigates these networks, had realised. From his experience, North Koreans based overseas set up fake companies in Hong Kong or other central Asian countries to buy the items using predominantly stolen cash. They then send the products onto North Korea, usually over its border with China. If a fake company is discovered and sanctioned, another will quickly pop up in its place. Sanctions have long been considered an imperfect tool to combat these networks, but to have any hope of working they need to be regularly updated and enforced. Both Russia and China have refused to impose new sanctions on North Korea since 2017. By buying Pyongyang's weapons, Moscow is now violating the very sanctions it once voted for as a member of the UN Security Council. Then earlier this year it effectively disbanded a UN panel that monitored sanctions breaches, likely to avoid scrutiny. ""We are witnessing the real-time crumbling of UN sanctions against North Korea, which buys Pyongyang a lot of breathing space"", Mr Byrne said. All this has implications that reach far beyond the war in Ukraine. ""The real winners here are the North Koreans"", said Mr Byrne. ""They have helped the Russians in a significant way, and this has bought them a tonne of leverage"". In March, RUSI documented large amounts of oil being shipped from Russia to North Korea, while railcars filled with what are thought to be rice and flour have been spotted crossing the countries' land border. This deal, thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, will boost not only Pyongyang's economy, but its military. Russia could also supply the North with the raw materials to continue making its missiles, or even military equipment such a fighter jets, and - at the most extreme end - the technical assistance to improve its nuclear weapons. Additionally, the North is getting the chance to test its latest missiles in a real-war scenario for the first time. With this valuable data, it will be able to make them better. More troubling still is that the war is providing North Korea with a shop window to the rest of the world. Now that Pyongyang is mass producing these weapons, it will want to sell them to more countries, and if the missiles are good enough for Russia, they will be good enough for others, said Dr Lewis - especially as the Russians are setting the example that it is okay to violate sanctions. He predicts going forward that North Korea will become a big supplier of missiles to countries in the China-Russia-Iran bloc. In the wake of Iran's assault on Israel this month, the US said it was ""incredibly concerned"" that North Korea could be working with Iran on its nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes. ""I see a lot of gloomy faces when we talk about this problem,"" said Mr Spleeters. ""But the good news is that now we know how reliant they are on foreign technology, we can do something about it"". Mr Spleeters is optimistic that by working with manufacturers they can cut off North Korea's supply chains. His team has already succeeded in identifying and shutting down an illicit network before it was able to complete a critical sale. But Dr Lewis is not convinced. ""We can make it harder, more inconvenient, maybe raise the cost, but none of this is going to prevent North Korea from making these weapons,"" he said, adding that the West had ultimately failed in its attempt to contain the rogue state. Now not only are its missiles a source of prestige and political power, but they are also generating it vast amounts of money, Dr Lewis explained. So why would Kim Jong Un ever give them up now?"

The tools include ""nudity protection"", which blurs naked images in direct messages. It will be turned on by default for under-18s. Pop-ups directing potential victims to support will also be trialled. Governments around the world have warned of the increasing threat to young people from sextortion. It often involves victims being sent a nude picture, before being invited to send their own in return - only to then be threatened that the image will be shared publicly unless they give in to the blackmailer's demands, On Wednesday, two Nigerian men pleaded guilty to sexually extorting teenage boys and young men in the US, including one who took his own life. The offence has also recently been linked to the suicide of a teenager in Australia. There are also harrowing cases of paedophiles using sextortion to coerce and abuse children. Much of the sextortion Instagram sees on its platform is the work of sophisticated criminal gangs seeking money. It is a ""horrific"" crime, the platform says. Its nudity protection system, first revealed in January , uses artificial intelligence (AI) running entirely on the user's device to detect nude images in direct messages and give users a choice whether to view them. It is designed ""not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude images to trick people into sending their own images in return,"" Instagram said. But Instagram stresses the system, which is opt-in for adults, does not report nude images to the company automatically, though users will be reminded they can block and report accounts if they wish. When the system detects naked images being sent, the user will be directed to safety tips, including reminders that recipients may screenshot or forward images without the sender's knowledge. The platform now says it will also deploy measures that detect signs that a user may potentially be a sextortionist and make it harder for them to interact with others including: For people who may have interacted with an account removed for sextortion, Instagram is testing pop-up messages that will direct them to expert advice and support. Instagram also says it will share more data to fight sextortion and child abuse with other tech firms through an initiative called Lantern . The announcement comes on the same day WhatsApp, another Meta platform, reduces its minimum age in the UK and Europe from 16 to 13. According to the platform, the minimum age is already 13 in the majority of countries around the world But Smartphone Free Childhood, a campaign group which believes smartphones expose children to harmful content, called the decision to reduce the minimum age ""tone deaf"". WhatsApp argues users, including teenagers, have extensive of controls over who they interact with."

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said it had discovered more than two thousand remotely filmed child abuse images of three to six-year-olds online in 2023. If follows recent warnings from the communications watchdog Ofcom that almost a quarter of children aged five to seven have a smartphone of their own . Responding to the report Security Minister Tom Tugendhat urged tech firms to do more to prevent abuse. He also called on parents ""to speak to your children about their use of social media, because the platforms you presume safe may pose a risk”. The IWF is a charity which helps detect and remove child sexual abuse imagery online. New analysis published in its latest annual report revealed it had discovered 2401 images of children aged three to six in so-called “self-generated” images on the open internet in 2023. “Self-generated” images are where a child is persuaded, coerced or tricked by a predator into carrying out acts via a webcam or handheld device. Nearly one in seven images were category A - the rating it assigns to those featuring the most serious abuse. Six in 10 images showed “sexual posing with nudity” it suggested. Analysts who reviewed some of the images found many, “were are taken at home in children’s bedrooms or in family bathrooms when the child is alone or with another child such as a sibling or friend”. Sometimes children were “completely unaware” they were being recorded. IWF analysts were confident that someone else was directing what happened as three to six-year-old children “are sexually naive and would not normally be aware of the possibility of this type of sexual behaviour,” it said. The report also notes that online child abuse material is more “extreme” with the charity reporting a  22% increase in category A imagery. Ofcom's research suggested a third of parents whose five to seven-year-olds browse social media are allowed to do so alone. Ian Critchley, who leads on child protection for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said protecting young children was not just the responsibility of parents and carers. ""The biggest change"" needed to come from the tech companies and online platforms, he said. As part of its work implementing the new Online Safety Act the communications watchdog has said it will consult on how automated tools, including AI, can be used to ""proactively detect"" illegal content - including child sexual abuse material. But the IWF is calling for swift action and argues technology firms should not wait. ""The harms are happening to children now, and our response must be immediate,"" its chief executive Susie Hargreaves said. AI is already used by some big tech firms to help identify content that violates its terms, including child abuse material. This is principally used to help identify material that is then reviewed by human moderators. But experts warn AI alone is not a panacea. Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey told the BBC: ""AI may prove useful in helping with the scale of the data being analysed but at its current state of development it shouldn’t be considered a complete solution."""
tech,tech,Neutral,"['World', 'the University of Maine', 'Brunel University', 'BBC', 'The University of Maine', 'Advanced Structures and Composites Center', '1.0']",World's biggest 3D printer whirs into action,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx7d34nl5vwo,2024-04-26,0.1475594267511674,Normal,False,Habitat destruction,"A giant 3D printer, which is big enough to make a house, has been unveiled at the University of Maine. The university says it has beaten its own record for the world's largest polymer 3D printer - with the new printer four times bigger than the previous machine. The Factory of the Future 1.0 (FoF 1.0) can print objects 96ft (29m) long - approximately the length of a blue whale. But experts say, despite the breakthrough, most of us will continue to live in homes made of bricks and mortar. Large 3D printers, such as that unveiled in Maine, are more like to be used to make parts of houses rather than full homes, says Dr Eujin Pei, who is an expert in additive manufacturing at Brunel University. He says they can be used for historical restoration, ""not to print a house, but sometimes to print decorative parts, or sometimes to restore some parts."" They may become useful after natural disasters to manufacture parts of destroyed buildings, he told the BBC. The University of Maine says it hopes the printer can be used to make affordable housing, as well as bridges, boats and wind turbines. It can print up to 500lbs (227kg) of material per hour. While 3D printers often print using plastic, the university hopes to include more sustainable materials and prioritise recycled polymers. Maine is also home to large forests - and the hope is to use residual wood from sawmills as material to feed into the printer. ""The downside is that those kind of materials are not so durable,"" says Dr Pei. Wood is ""not so robust, but it's more environmentally friendly,"" he says. The 3D printing process saves on time and waste by only using the materials needed, but there are still some environmental impacts. ""Sometimes the materials being used are not fully being able to be recycled because of contamination"" in the production process, Dr Pei adds. However, as products are designed on a computer first, their energy efficiency can be calculated beforehand - and they can be printed in a way which takes less time. ""There are definitely cost savings with respect to energy efficiency [and] resource efficiency,"" says Dr Pei. Partly funded by the US military, the giant printer in Maine uses ""sensors, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence"" to help manufacture large products, said Habib Dagher, who is head of the university's Advanced Structures and Composites Center. FoF 1.0's record-breaking predecessor built a bungalow as a prototype, but the hope is to help solve Maine's housing shortage with the new FoF 1.0. It also used wood as a material which was fed into the manufacturing process. The university says the two printers can work together in manufacturing the same object too. It has long been hoped that 3D printing will transform manufacturing, both large and small scale. It has been used in a wide range of fields, from space rockets to human cells to puppets. But it also has a dark side - with criminals using the technology to manufacture weapons. Last year, in what was thought to be the first case of its kind in the UK, two men were jailed for making sub-machine guns using a 3D printer. Later in 2023, a man in Birmingham was sentenced to five years in prison for making 3D-printed assault rifles."

The question had been examined in a five week trial at the High Court. The judge, Mr Justice Mellor, made his ruling as soon as the proceedings had concluded. He had been expected to retire to consider the case but said he was able to reach a decision so quickly because the ""evidence was overwhelming"". Bitcoin is the world's best known cryptocurrency - and has recently captured the headlines after surging to a new record high valuation. But the identity of the person or people who invented it has always been unknown, other than they go by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Dr Wright, who is from Australia, has claimed to be Satoshi since 2016 - but his claims and evidence to back them up have long been questioned by cryptocurrency experts. He has been in and out of court for years in legal battles with individuals who challenged his story. This case, heard at the Intellectual Property Court, a division of London's High Court, was brought by a group of Bitcoin companies. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) - whose members include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's payments firm, Block - accused Dr Wright of creating a chilling effect on the development of the cryptocurrency because of his aggressive legal cases. During the hearing, COPA's legal team said Dr Wright had carried out a ""a massive campaign of dishonesty and forgery"". It even accused him of forging fresh documents while the proceedings were ongoing. COPA's lawyer, Jonathan Hough, said elements of Dr Wight's conduct ""stray into farce"" - but he told the court it also had ""deadly serious"" consequences. ""On the basis of his dishonest claim to be Satoshi, he has pursued claims he puts at hundreds of billions of dollars, including against numerous private individuals,"" he told the trial. Throughout the trial Dr Wright's legal team argued that if he was not the inventor then the real Satoshi Nakamoto would have come forward to discredit him. Mr Justice Mellor agreed that Dr Wright was not who he said he was. ""Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto"", he told the court. ""Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system."" He said he would give a full written judgement in due course."

Louise Scammell, South Brent, said she sketched the wildlife she saw on waterproof paper while holding her breath under the sea. Once on dry land, she creates prints from the sketches. Her work is on display as part of the Delamore Arts exhibition throughout May at Delamore House in Cornwood, near Ivybridge. Ms Scammell said she had always loved the sea and its wildlife, and sketching underwater developed from a love of snorkelling and taking photographs. She said she found that photographs were too complex and busy, so she found sketching while in the water helped her focus in and simplify the wildlife she was witnessing. She said: ""It’s very difficult with my camera equipment and a drawing pad, floating around to be coordinated and work quickly. It's a complicated process."" Along with a homemade drawing pad, she uses graphite to draw. ""It's taken a few years to adapt and learn how to do it. ""My interest in the sea has a constant throughout my life and it’s been a progression from snorkelling and observing, then taking photographs, and subsequently actually sketching under water."" Her latest work features the birds that live off the Pembrokeshire coast. It took a while for the puffins and razorbills to get used to her, she said, even with her wearing a headpiece shaped like a puffin sometimes in an attempt to not scare any off. She said: ""By day five, they got used to me always being there. ""The razorbills were like little bandits diving in around me. I’m not convinced the puffins were fooled by my hat though."" Once she is out of the water, she works quickly on developing her sketches further and creating lithograph prints from them. The exhibition she is taking part in is in Delamore Art’s newly-refurbished Carriage Gallery. It features 11different print techniques, from lino printing to screen printing. Gavin Dollard, from Delamore Arts, said: ""The new gallery has been really popular and drawing people in... We hope to see about 6,000-7,000 visitors this year in just the one month."" Gavin and Nicky Dollard have been opening Delamore House for the month of May for 23 years now. About 300 painters, ceramicists and textile artists all have work on display.

The Grade II-listed A-block of County Hall in Taunton has had paint thrown at it three times in the past two months. Protesters want Somerset Council to evict a defence firm with connections to Israel from one of its commercial buildings in Bristol. The company supplies the British military but said nothing is sent to Israel from its Bristol site. The cost of cleaning up the first two paint protests, which the council said required specialist attention as it was a Grade II-listed building, was £13,300 excluding VAT and any internal staffing costs. Paint from the most recent protest has not been cleaned off yet, but the council said it estimated it would spend £20,000 in total on cleaning and restoring the building. Somerset Council has faced repeated pressure from protesters over its links with Elbit Systems UK, which is a tenant of a building the council owns in Bristol. The Aztec West 600 building makes up part of the council's commercial portfolio, which it is in the process of selling off. Elbit Systems UK is a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd that is based in Israel. Last week a motion was passed by councillors to explore legal routes to remove Elbit Systems UK as a tenant. The council was later forced to apologise to the arms firm for incorrectly suggesting in a motion that it provided weapons to Israel's military. The council said: ""Elbit Systems UK Limited have contacted us to say this is factually incorrect and they do not supply weapons or military equipment to the Israeli Defence Forces or the Israeli Ministry of Defence. ""The council would like to apologise and withdraw the statement that Elbit Systems UK Limited supplies military equipment to the Israeli Defence Forces or the Israeli Ministry of Defence."" Following the vote last week, Elbit Systems UK issued a statement saying it provided equipment to the British army and that ""nothing from the Aztec site goes to the IDF"", branding any direct links with Israel as ""grossly misleading"". A spokesman said: ""We continue to invest and expand our range of services in the United Kingdom, providing critical support and advanced technology to the British Armed Forces from Aztec West 600 and other sites across the country."""
politics,politics,Neutral,"['the House of Representatives', 'House', 'House', 'Congress', 'House', 'Republican Party', 'House', 'Capitol', 'Congress']",Democrats make shock move to back Republican speaker Mike Johnson,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68933018,2024-05-01,0.13474675298103433,Normal,False,Overfishing,"Top congressional Democrats announced on Tuesday that their party would throw Mike Johnson a lifeline if Republicans tried to remove him as speaker of the House of Representatives. A handful had hinted they would support Mr Johnson for going against conservatives in his own party to pass $61bn in military aid for Ukraine. ""The time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,"" the House Democratic leadership team said in a statement, implying that Republicans who opposed support for Ukraine were aiding Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. Mr Johnson, a devout evangelical Louisiana conservative who has strong right-wing views on social issues such as abortion, is now effectively leading a coalition government in the House. That may be a bitter pill to swallow for Democrats who vehemently disagree with him on policy and who believe their party could benefit from extended Republican turmoil. However, co-operation with the speaker goes beyond just aid for Ukraine. Earlier this year, Mr Johnson relied on Democratic votes to approve new operational funding for the US government, preventing a partial shutdown in services and keeping many of the Democratic spending priorities intact. Three weeks ago, he rebuffed members of his own party to re-authorise a controversial national security surveillance programme. Some conservatives had been pushing for his removal even before Ukraine reached the floor. In March, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion that would trigger a vote on his removal. She warned on Tuesday that she would soon bring that motion to a vote. ""I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes,"" she said on social media. ""Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display,"" she added, using a term popularised by those who claim there is no real difference between Democrats and establishment Republicans. However, rank-and-file House Republicans seem uneasy with the prospect of a new battle, just six months after the previous speaker, Kevin McCarthy, was booted from the job. It took three weeks of intra-party wrangling and acrimony before Mr Johnson, a relative unknown, won the job with unanimous Republican support. Donald Trump has been a key, and somewhat unlikely, ally for Mr Johnson throughout this recent challenge to his leadership. The former president, and presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has offered words of praise for the embattled speaker, saying in a radio interview last week that he is a ""good person"" who is ""trying very hard"". He noted that Mr Johnson has had to work with a razor-thin Republican Party majority in the chamber. Democratic support for Mr Johnson, along with Mr Trump's continued backing, is likely to secure his hold on power at least through to November's election for all 435 House seats. If Republicans retain control of the chamber - which is far from guaranteed - Mr Johnson will not be able to count on Democratic support, however, opening the possibility of another moment of reckoning among conservatives. For now, however, Mr Johnson said he was focusing on doing his job. ""We have to do what we believe to be the right thing,"" he told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday. ""What the country needs right now is a functioning Congress."""

The Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an ""uninterrupted and sufficient flow"" of aid into Gaza. Trade between the two countries was worth almost $7bn (£5.6bn) last year. Israel's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator"". Israel Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was ""disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements"". He added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries. The ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's ""uncompromising attitude"" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: ""Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption."" In 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. But relations have worsened in recent decades. In 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. Relations were restored in 2016, but both countries expelled each other's top diplomats two years later in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border. Mr Erdogan has become increasingly strident in his criticism of Israel since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October last year. He has repeatedly criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, comparing him to Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Joseph Stalin and dubbing him ""the butcher of Gaza"". Mr Netanyahu has said Turkey's leader is the last person who can preach morality to Israel. In March he said President Erdogan ""supports the mass murderers and rapists of Hamas, denies the Armenian genocide [and] massacres Kurds in his own country"". The Turkish leader has for months come under domestic political pressure to announce measures against Israel, from both opponents and allies. His ruling AK party suffered its worst defeat in two decades in local elections at the end of March, and many religious voters supported the Islamist New Welfare party, which had called for hardline measures against Israel. Not long after the vote, Turkey imposed restrictions on 54 products being exported to Israel, from iron and steel to jet fuel, pesticides and construction equipment. The trade ministry in Ankara said on Thursday that the action was now being extended to all exports and imports. Israel was Turkey's 13th biggest export market in 2023, receiving 2.1% of Turkish exports last year. Turkey was Israel's fifth biggest source of imports last year. Israel has come under increasing criticism for conditions in the Gaza Strip. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May. On Thursday, the White House said a pier built by the US military to facilitate the flow of aid into the territory would be open within days. The US has published photos showing logistics vessels and personnel assembling the floating pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship. However, the UN says a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and that land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed. Earlier this week, Israel reopened the Erez Crossing into the northern Gaza strip for aid convoys, under pressure from its Western allies and following repeated appeals from international aid organisations. However, Jordan said some of its aid lorries were attacked by Israeli settlers before reaching the crossing. A recent UN-backed report offered hard statistical evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza was turning into a man-made famine. The UN's most senior human rights official, Volker Türk, told the BBC that there was a ""plausible"" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Israel denies limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel and Hamas that ""the time is now"" for a deal to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there. He said a deal was on the table and Hamas should agree to it. Mediators are awaiting a response from Hamas to the latest proposal. It reportedly involves a 40-day ceasefire and the release of more than 30 Israeli hostages in exchange for many more Palestinian prisoners."

The country's second-largest city has been targeted almost incessantly since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. But this time was worse than usual, because, when rescue workers arrived at the scene, there was a second strike. Three of them were killed. The following Friday, it happened again when Russian missiles hit Zaporizhzhia, a major city in Ukraine's southeast. Rescuers and journalists rushed to the scene, and then two more missiles hit. In total, four people were killed and more than 20 were wounded, including two local journalists. Both the Kharkiv and the Zaporizhzhia attacks employed a technique called ""double-tap"" - when an initial air strike is followed by a second attack, killing rescuers trying to help the injured. Russia has carried out this kind of repeat attack before. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a strike on a building in the southern city of Odesa in March that killed 20 was a double-tap, and called it a ""despicable act of cowardice"". But Ukrainian officials say they have seen an increase in the use of such attacks. Oleh Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv region, told Ukrainian media that Russia has started incorporating repeat strikes on its targets ""day and night"". ""The occupiers are using the tactic of double-taps to hit civilian rescuers and other workers who are there first to arrive at the scene,"" he said. On Thursday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it had seen a ""particularly troubling pattern"" of double taps in recent weeks. It called them ""cruel"" and ""unconscionable"" and urged for them to stop. Rescuers from Ukraine's State Emergencies Service DSNS often arrive to deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks before everyone else, and they also say the threat of repeat strikes is becoming ever more frequent. ""Unfortunately, the tactic of double-tapping has been used increasingly often recently. This is difficult to comprehend. The Russians have no right to do this,"" DSNS spokesman Oleksandr Khorunzhy told the BBC. ""They know perfectly well what they're doing, and not just to rescuers, police officers, utility workers or medics. This affects ordinary civilians,"" Mr Khorunzhy said. He called double-taps ""utterly immoral"". ""I can't wrap my head around this, it's just inhuman,"" he said. ""They see perfectly well that unarmed rescuers are the first to arrive at the sites of their attacks."" The DSNS says 91 of its rescuers have been killed and more than 340 injured since the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kira Oves was one of the journalists injured in the Zaporizhzhia double-tap attack. She told the BBC that she had just arrived at the scene of a strike when she heard a whistling sound. ""A colleague shouted: Incoming! On the ground!"" She crouched and heard a massive explosion. She only realised that she was wounded after she felt blood streaming down her face. She and her colleague ran to what they thought was a safe place - only to hear another ""enormous blast"". ""I knelt down, and a policewoman rushed over to me to help close the wound. Another police officer bandaged my head to stop the bleeding. From the shouting we found out that another journalist had been wounded much more badly,"" Kira said. She had not expected two more strikes to follow the one she had gone to report on. Ukrainians targeted by double-tap attacks accuse Russia of trying to crush their fighting spirit and resilience. They also worry that no medic or emergency worker would be prepared to risk coming to their rescue for fear of coming under fire, too. But there are other pragmatic reasons for Russia's strategy too. ""If you abandon any pretence at subscribing to international humanitarian law and even commonly accepted humanitarian norms, then there is a sound military rationale for double-tap attacks because you target high-profile targets,"" says Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, a British think-tank. There is a limited supply of first responders such as medics, emergency personnel and fire crews and they are difficult to replace. ""If you take them out by the second attack on the same spot, at exactly the time when they've congregated to help the victims of the first attack, you're actually achieving quite a lot."" Karolina Hird, an analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War, says double-tap attacks targeting rescue workers could, and likely do, constitute a war crime. ""If, indeed, Russian forces are found to be targeting specifically and intentionally these sections of the population - that would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law and the general rules and norms of armed conflict,"" Ms Hird told the BBC. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross told the BBC that all parties involved in a conflict had an obligation to ""respect and protect"" both the wounded and those who cared for them. If one party chooses to re-attack the same target, international humanitarian law requires them to take ""particular care"" when first responders are trying to evacuate the wounded, the ICRC said. Russia adopted the same strategy previously in Syria, where its troops fought against anti-government rebels between 2015 and 2017. In that case it targeted rescuers from the White Helmets, a civil defence group. ""We have documented hundreds of such cases since Russia intervened in 2015,"" the White Helmets chief Raed al-Saleh says. ""Frankly, the Russian army has no morals when it comes to military operations. It focuses on breaking the will of civilians."" Russia has not explicitly disavowed double-taps, but it has repeatedly denied it aims for civilian targets. ""Our military does not hit social facilities and residential neighbourhoods and does not hit civilians,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in January. But those in towns and cities across Ukraine see the opposite is the case. ""They're using double-taps to kill as many of us as possible,"" says Kira Oves, the journalist wounded in one such attack in Zaporizhzhia. ""But they'll fail, because Ukrainians are survivors. We shall win."""

On Monday the military told the tens of thousands of people affected to begin heading towards an “expanded humanitarian area"" to the north, where it said they would find field hospitals, tents and basic supplies. But Palestinians warned that the area was made up of neighbourhoods that were already overcrowded and lacking in essential services, were still coming under intense bombardment, or had been left in ruins by recent fighting. Almost seven months into its war against Hamas, senior Israeli government and military figures have insisted that victory is impossible without a full-scale ground assault on Rafah. But Israel’s closest ally, the US, has said it has yet to see a credible plan to protect the more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there - half of them children. In March, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was intending to evacuate most, if not all, of the civilians in Rafah ahead of major offensive and send them to “humanitarian islands” in central Gaza where aid and tents would be provided. It appeared that plan was being at least partly put into action, when the IDF announced the evacuation of eastern Rafah and the “expansion of the humanitarian area” in nearby al-Mawasi as part of its preparations for ground operations there. “This expanded humanitarian area includes field hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medication and additional supplies,” an IDF statement said. An IDF spokesperson said the evacuation would be “gradual” and affect an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people. However, a Palestinian Red Crescent official put the figure at 250,000 and a UN official said many others would be on the move because they feared this was only “the first phase in a longer operation”. Flyers dropped by Israeli aircraft over Rafah on Monday featured a map that identifies nine area blocks in south-eastern Rafah, including al-Shokat, al-Salam, al-Jneineh, Tabbet Zarei and al-Yarmouk, as well as open land around the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossings. The UN said the evacuation zone covered more than 30 sq km (12 sq miles) and was home to nine sites sheltering displaced people, as well as three clinics and six warehouses. The flyer instructed all residents to evacuate immediately and head towards an approximately 60 sq km area stretching north along the Mediterranean coast from al-Mawasi - a narrow strip of agricultural land that has long been an IDF-designated “humanitarian zone” - to the city of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah. The IDF did not provide any details about the locations of the tents for the people being evacuated, but in recent weeks satellite images have shown several encampments constructed north of Rafah and west of Khan Younis . Mohammed Daoud said the 35 members of his family living had “no choice but to leave” after finding out that their house in the Oraiba area was inside the evacuation zone. “We do not know where to go and how we will manage,” he told the BBC. Rasha Sheikh Khalil, a displaced woman living in a tent in Rafah with her husband and four children, said: “I had started preparing my bags and getting ready to return to my neighbourhood in Gaza City, but the bad news [on Monday] surprised us.” “No-one cares about our fate. For seven months we have not tasted comfort and tranquillity.” Ghada el-Kurd, a mother-of-two who has been displaced six times over the last four months, told the BBC that she was living only 15 minutes away from one of the evacuated areas but was staying put for now. “I’m so confused... I have no place to go. This was the last place I know,” she said. “If I want to come back to Khan Younis there is no place - it is all destroyed. [As for] areas of al-Mawasi, they are crowded and I cannot any more live inside a tent - it’s so hot and my health does not allow me to be in such a situation. Regarding Deir al-Balah... there are a lot of air strikes there... and it is a very dangerous area.” The UN said it was “not taking part in involuntary evacuations or in the setting up of any displacement zones”. But James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children’s agency, Unicef, who was in Gaza last month, said Ghada el-Kurd’s assessment of the IDF’s humanitarian area was “absolutely spot on”. ""There's nowhere to go. Khan Younis, let's be clear, is rubble,” he told the BBC. “I've walked around those streets of Khan Younis. It's not a little bit destroyed, it's utterly devastated.” “Deir al-Balah... has now got raw sewage running through the streets because sanitation has just been devastated, and al-Mawasi is a beach, a sandy area, and we're starting to hit summer.” “We've already had reports of children dying of dehydration. So when we're told that people should move to humanitarian zones, that's a terrifying irony when humanitarians aren't working in these zones."" But, he added: “Of course, families will move. They will move because they will move or be bombed.” Mr Elder said the aid operation in Gaza was already very fragile because it was “continually undermined by bombings, by insecurity, by denial of access”, but that an Israeli offensive in Rafah could push it to breaking point. UN officials are particularly concerned that the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings - the key entry points for aid into Gaza - could be closed during the current Israeli operation in eastern Gaza. Kerem Shalom was shut on Sunday after four Israeli soldiers there were killed by 10 rockets launched by Hamas fighters from an area near the Rafah crossing, according to the IDF. But Israel’s prime minister told the US president on Monday that he would ensure Kerem Shalom reopened for humanitarian assistance. Kerem Shalom was still closed on Tuesday morning, when the IDF announced that its troops had ""obtained operational control"" of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - has said it will maintain a presence in Rafah as long as possible and would continue providing lifesaving aid. But it has also warned that the continued interruption of the entry of aid and fuel supplies at the Rafah crossing would ""halt the critical humanitarian response"" across Gaza. ""The catastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern Gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted,"" the agency said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. The IDF has said it is committed to facilitating humanitarian aid into and within Gaza and that it has established alternative crossings, including two in the north."

These attacks include the detention of journalists, the spreading of misinformation and suppression of independent voices. With more than half of the world’s population going to the polls in 2024, governments are failing to protect journalism, the organisation says. The report comes as the BBC warned that over 300 of its journalists were now working in exile from their home countries, amid increasing attacks on their reporting. ""Some political groups fuel hatred and distrust of journalists by insulting them, discrediting them, and threatening them,"" the organisation - known by its French acronym RSF - said. RSF’s index ranks 180 countries on the ability for journalists to work without interference or threats. Norway retained its spot at the top and “information desert” Eritrea came bottom, taking over from last year’s lowest-ranked nation, North Korea. The bottom 10 also includes China, Iran, Afghanistan , and Syria. Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland and Germany rounded out the top 10. The UK rose three places to 23, with RSF criticising the dominant role held by News UK, Reach Plc and Daily Mail and General Trust in the market. Authoritarian regimes across the Middle East have been tightening their grip on news and information with “increasing vigour”, according to the report. Four of the world’s biggest jailers of journalists, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iran, are in the region and continue to detain newsgatherers, according to the RSF report. At least 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 1 May 2024, according to the RSF. The United States (55) has fallen 10 places ahead of elections due to increasing attacks on journalists from political players. The report also criticised the ""highly concentrated"" model of US media ownership, adding that ""many of the companies buying American media outlets appear to prioritize profits over public interest journalism"". In Russia (ranked 162), RSF says the state continues a “crusade” against journalism with more than 1,500 journalists fleeing abroad since the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The reports comes as the number of BBC World Service journalists forced to work in exile has doubled since 2020 , reflecting press crackdowns in Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. Many face jail, death threats and harassment. The RSF also warned about the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes , calling its use in spreading misinformation “disturbing”."

A girl aged 10 was among four killed in Odesa late on Wednesday, in an attack coinciding with the city's liberation from the Nazis during World War Two. Two women and a girl of 14 were also killed in an attack on a pharmacy not far from Ukraine's northern border with Russia, officials said. Russia's recent attacks have targeted Ukraine's energy sector in particular. Power infrastructure came under attack in five regions early on Thursday from more than 40 missiles and 40 drones, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Some 200,000 people were left without power in the Kharkiv region alone, said officials, and Mr Zelensky appealed for increased international support. ""We need air defence and other defence assistance, not turning a blind eye and lengthy discussions,"" he said. A multi-billion dollar aid package for Kyiv continues to be blocked by Republicans in the US Congress. The head of the Ukrainian air force said 57 of 82 Russian airborne weapons were destroyed, although air defences failed to intercept either Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles fired by Russian MiG warplanes or guided S-300 missiles. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians with double-tap tactics, where a missile strike is followed by a second which aims to kill emergency service personnel arriving at the scene. Governor Kiper said ballistic missiles had been used in the strikes on Odesa between 18:00 and 18:30 (15:00-15:30 GMT) on Wednesday. Attacks on Kharkiv, the closest big city to the Russian border, have been intensifying in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials have said the city might be the target of a future Russian offensive. The country's second-largest city has suffered extensive damage from months of Russian bombardment since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine has been suffering setbacks on the ground in the past few months. Ukrainian troops have been running out of ammunition as vital US support has been held up by supporters of former President Donald Trump in Congress. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has been refusing to call a vote on a bill that would provide $60bn (£48bn) in military aid for Ukraine. The US's top general in Europe told Congress on Wednesday that Ukraine would run out of artillery shells and air defence interceptors ""in fairly short order"" without American support. Gen Christopher Cavoli said Russia was currently firing five artillery shells for every one fired by Ukrainian forces - a disparity which could soon increase to 10 to one.

The issue will be remedied in a future software update, Apple says, but it is not known how rapidly this will happen. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) , Ms Riley demanded that Apple explain what had happened. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism"", she argued. The issue, according to Apple, relates to a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps. The notes accompanying the latest iOS update say that it includes ""new emojis."" The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967, and have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. This is not the first time a big tech company has found itself embroiled in the bitter dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Last year rival tech giant Meta had to apologise after a bug resulted in it adding ""terrorist"" to the biographies of some Instagram users describing themselves as Palestinian. Meta said it fixed a problem ""that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations"" in some of its products."

The shipment consisted of 1,800 2,000lb (907kg) bombs and 1,700 500lb bombs, the official told the BBC. Israel has not ""fully addressed"" US concerns over the humanitarian needs of civilians in Rafah, they added. An Israeli military official appeared to play down the US move. The delayed arms shipment comes as US President Joe Biden faces mounting domestic pressure - from Democratic lawmakers and some parts of the US public - to rein in Israeli operations in Gaza amid rising civilian deaths and a worsening humanitarian situation. Despite firm and vocal US opposition, Israel appears poised to mount a large-scale invasion of Rafah, a congested part of southern Gaza that is Hamas' last major stronghold in the territory. US officials have warned that an operation in the city - where the population has swelled with refugees from other parts of Gaza - could lead to extensive civilian casualties. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the US had provided ""unprecedented"" security assistance since the beginning of the war, adding that disputes between the allies were resolved ""behind closed doors in a matter-of-fact way"". But a leading member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party in Israel told BBC's Newshour on Wednesday that he believes US domestic political considerations are behind the decision to halt the delivery of bombs. ""I totally disagree that the American election has nothing to do with it,"" said Boaz Bismuth, a member of the both the Israeli parliament and the foreign affairs and defence committee. The weapons being held back by the US are related to a future delivery, so it is unlikely to have any immediate impact. But given the rate at which Israel is bombing it will likely affect future strikes fairly soon. Overnight, there were more Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, hours after Israeli forces took control of the Palestinians side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. The Israeli bombardment was particularly intense around Rafah. Local medics said seven members of one family were killed. Rafah has been a key entry point for aid, and the only exit for people able to flee, since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October. The crossing remained closed on Wednesday morning, but the Israeli military said it was reopening the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing , which had been closed for four days because of Hamas rocket fire. On Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a ""limited"" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure. Meanwhile, efforts continue to reach a ceasefire, alongside the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In Cairo, delegations from Israel and Hamas have resumed negotiations through mediators. After refusing to confirm or deny reports of delayed weapons shipments, a US official on Tuesday finally confirmed that at least one shipment of bombs was delayed this week. ""The US position has been that Israel should not launch a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere else to go,"" the senior US administration official said. The official added that talks with Israel are ""ongoing and have not fully addressed our concerns"" and the US had been reviewing its weapons transfers to Israel since April. ""We are especially focused on the end-use of the 2,000lb bombs and the impact they could have in dense urban settings as we have seen in other parts of Gaza,"" the official said. They stressed that the shipments were unrelated to last month's landmark $17bn military aid package, but had been drawn from ""previously appropriated funds"". The larger 2,000lb bombs are most likely to be Mk-84s or possibly BLU-109s - or both. The former is a cheap, general purpose munition and the latter a penetration bomb designed for use against hardened or underground targets. Both can be fitted with JDAM kits that deliver precision capability using satellite navigation. Laser guidance kits can also be fitted. These bombs can be made to be very accurate, down to just a few metres. But in a dense, urban environment like Gaza the risk of so-called ""collateral damage"" is high. And that is where the concern lies. The smaller 500lb bombs can also be fitted with guidance units dropped from jets. We do not know exactly how Israel uses these weapons, but media posts from the Israeli Air Force frequently show F-16 and F-15 jets loaded with JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition] kits for strikes. It is worth remembering that such weapons would not just be used in Gaza but also targets in southern Lebanon belonging to the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which has been involved in almost daily cross-border exchanges of fire with Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war. It is a clear message from a Washington growing increasingly concerned about Israel's war in Gaza. Israel launched the campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. More than 34,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead."

His comments come after a crisis Nato-Ukraine summit on Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv needed ""seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems"" to defend the country's cities. Seven people, including two children, were killed in Russian missile strikes on Friday, Ukrainian officials said. In other key developments on Friday: Speaking after the Nato-Ukraine Council summit held by video link, Mr Stoltenberg said: ""Nato defence ministers have agreed to step up and provide further military support, including more air defence."" He said the 32-member bloc ""has mapped out existing capabilities across the alliance and there are systems that can be made available to Ukraine"". ""So I expect new announcements on air defence capabilities for Ukraine soon,"" he added. The Nato chief said there were Patriot and other advanced air defence systems available in stocks of Nato countries that could be given to Ukraine - but he gave no details about what exactly Kyiv might get. Last week, Germany pledged to supply Kyiv with a third US-made Patriot battery out of its military stocks. Ukraine currently has several Patriot systems, but not enough to defend its cities from massive Russian attacks. Meanwhile, President Zelensky said after the summit: ""We need seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems, and it's a minimum number. They can save many lives and really change the situation. You [Nato] have such systems."" The Ukrainian leader laid out four other key priorities Kyiv has long been pressing for: Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is in its third year now, and there are no signs that Europe's biggest land war since World War Two might end any time soon. Moscow's troops have recently been making steady - albeit slow - advances in eastern Ukraine, as Kyiv faces critical arms shortages. Mr Zelensky recently admitted that Ukraine is outgunned and could lose the war without urgent Western military aid. Ukraine is critically dependent on advanced armoury supplies from its Western allies, particularly the US, to be able to continue fighting Russia - a far bigger military force with an abundance of artillery ammunition. Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian officials said seven people, including a boy and a girl, were killed and more than 30 injured in Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region. The northern city of Chernihiv was struck in Russia's deadliest attack for some time earlier this week, leaving 18 dead and dozens wounded. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Air Force said it had brought down a Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bomber 300km (186 miles) from Ukrainian territory. It said the plane eventually went down in Russia's Stavropol region after it had launched a missile strike on Ukraine. Ukraine's defence intelligence described the strike as a special operation similar to January's attack on a Russian A-50 spy plane . Intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told BBC Ukraine that ""we waited for a long time, prepared, and finally succeeded"". A source in Ukraine's intelligence later told the BBC the Russian bomber was shot down on Friday using a Soviet-era S-200 air defence system, which is believed to have been upgraded. Unverified footage showed a plane on fire spiralling out of control and falling to the ground. Russia's defence ministry blamed a technical malfunction after the bomber had carried out a ""combat task"". Two pilots had been found alive, a third crew member was killed and rescue services were looking for a fourth, Stavropol's regional governor said."

Intimation. Now, it's no holds barred accusations. The Russian authorities are aggressively pushing the line that Ukraine and the West were behind last month's Crocus City concert hall massacre outside Moscow which left 145 people dead. The Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. But soon after the suspected gunmen were detained President Vladimir Putin hinted at a Ukrainian connection. At the weekend Russian state TV broadcast interrogation videos of the four suspects, all citizens of Tajikistan. One of the men said on camera that the post-attack plan had been ""to head towards Kyiv"". Their words must be taken with extreme caution. During a court appearance after their arrest the men showed signs of torture. The Russian TV correspondent presenting the report went on to make a series of strange claims: ""Following the terrorist attack Western sources and many Russian 'foreign agents' began to shift the focus from the Ukrainian connection to, exclusively, Islamic State."" In Russia many Kremlin critics have been designated ""foreign agents"" for allegedly receiving funding from abroad or just being deemed ""under foreign influence"". The ""shift of focus"" to the IS was hardly surprising. Not only had the group announced that it was behind the attack, it had released video of the shooting. By contrast, Ukraine had denied any involvement. What's more, both America and, reportedly, Iran had warned Moscow of possible attacks on Russian soil. In its 13-minute report, Russian state TV made no mention of the IS claim of responsibility. Then, from the journalist, this baseless accusation - that Western media ""had more sympathy for those who carried out the terrorist attack which killed more than 140 defenceless people, than for the victims…"" It was a clear attempt to demonise the West in the eyes of the Russian public. It's not just Russian TV saying this. So is the Russian foreign ministry. In a statement on its Telegram channel, the ministry claimed that in the West ""there is a strict order not to report in the media the true scale of the tragedy - not to mention the number of victims of the terrorist attack, the dead children… ""Demonstrations of humanity and sympathy for the Russian people are not allowed."" This is pure parallel reality. The BBC has received no such order. International media organisations widely reported the devastating consequences of the mass shooting and fire at Crocus City. As for sympathy, many Western diplomats visited the Russian foreign ministry to sign a book of condolence and, later, laid flowers for the victims outside Crocus City. That hasn't stopped Russian officials from lining up to blame Ukraine and the West. Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB security service, told Russian TV: ""We believe that the action was prepared by both the Islamist radicals themselves and was facilitated by Western special services. The special services of Ukraine are directly related to this."" Last week President Putin claimed that ""Russia cannot be the target of terrorist attacks by Islamic fundamentalists. We are a country that demonstrates a unique example of interfaith harmony and inter-religious and inter-ethnic unity"". Yet only last month the FSB reported it had thwarted an IS plot to attack a Moscow synagogue. So why is the Russian leadership seemingly determined to frame Ukraine and the West for the huge loss of life at Crocus City? Here are some possible reasons: Since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Russians have been led to believe that their principal adversaries are Ukraine and the ""collective West"". It's a message the authorities here are unwilling to alter. After all, if the Russian public were to conclude that radical Islam is a greater threat to their security than the Ukrainian government or Western leaders, they may wonder why Moscow hasn't focused on that particular threat and has chosen, instead, to fight Ukraine. Last month President Putin publicly dismissed a US embassy warning that an attack by extremists here was ""imminent"". He called the terror alert ""outright blackmail…[with] the intention of intimidating and destabilising our society"". The Crocus City concert hall attack followed days later. US officials subsequently made it clear that the intelligence they had shared with the Russian authorities had been ""specific, timely, and credible"". Blaming Kyiv and the West may be an attempt to distract attention from the question of what information was passed on and how the Russian authorities acted upon it. Asserting that Kyiv and the West were connected to the attack gives Moscow a pretext for any future escalation in the war in Ukraine - if it decides it needs it. But some commentators are warning the Russian authorities that, for a political system, identifying the wrong enemy can prove a fatal mistake. ""That's the way this type of system usually dies,"" believes political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov, honorary senior research associate at University College London. ""They concentrate on someone they see as the main enemy and miss the real one somewhere else. For now [the authorities] will concentrate on Ukraine, on the West, on liberals. And they will open the back door. It's through the back door that the real danger will come."""

Eleanor Shenderey, 16, posts photos of herself wearing her costumes, and has 59,000 followers on TikTok. The schoolgirl sometimes wears the clothes while visiting historic houses, and is frequently asked to have her photo taken with other visitors. ""I often take the dresses with me because I just think - why not? If you've got this gorgeous backdrop, why would you not want to immerse yourself in it and get dressed up?""  Eleanor was taught to sew by her grandmother, who was an art and textiles teacher. She began sewing historical costumes in 2020: ""I just haven't really stopped. I think I've just been inspired by all the beautiful things that I've seen."" Among her inspirations is the TV show Bridgerton: ""It's such a new type of period drama because it's not what you're used to seeing. I think it's really interesting,"" she says. The first historical piece she made was a Tudor gown, crafted out of her parents' old curtains: ""I said, 'I'll take those!'... and it's just gone from there,"" she recalls. Some outfits can take a month to complete. ""It just depends on the complexity of the costume. So, for example, if I was going to make a Regency dress, I can usually get that done within a few days - or up to a week. ""But later Victorian dresses, such as bustle dresses, have so many layers to them, and they're so much more complicated to make, that it can take me up to a month."" Storing the dresses can be a challenge, however, having made some 300 outfits to date. ""We don't have a spare room anymore - I've got all my costumes in there!"" she exclaims. She has not kept all 300 dresses though. Some have been sold, and others have been dismantled and remade into other costumes: ""If I'm not going to wear it, there's no use in it sitting around in the box."" Currently she is busy making her prom dress, but says it will not be a period piece. ""It's going to be more modern. It's not a very interesting dress: It has a corset bodice and a short skirt - so it's not the usual big costume."" Eleanor is fascinated by history and fashion, and finds fashion to be an accessible way of telling stories. ""I think part of the reason I make the dresses is to tell this visual and social history, ""Especially for women in the past, so much of how they communicated is through what they wore and how they presented themselves,"" says Eleanor, who is considering a career as a historian, or in curation. ""It's something I'm really interested in doing. Even if it's not solely focused on fashion, I think fashion will always play a part in it, especially because I'm so passionate about telling forgotten women's stories,"" she says.

The case, brought by Mr Huang's family, was scheduled to begin in the California Superior Court this week. If the trial had gone ahead, it would have brought increased scrutiny of the firm's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technology. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed and reports have said the deal still needs to be approved by a judge. Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Before the settlement, Tesla argued that Mr Huang had misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident. The firm has previously won trials in California by arguing that drivers involved had not followed its instructions to maintain attention while using the system. The electric vehicle (EV) maker faces a series of lawsuits over crashes related to the alleged use of its driver-assistant technology. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also been investigating some accidents involving Autopilot. For many years, Tesla has promised to produce an autonomous car but has yet to launch one. On Friday, Mr Musk said the company plans to unveil a self-driving robotaxi in August. The settlement with Mr Huang's family comes at a time when the company is battling weakening sales. Deliveries slid sharply in the first three months of this year as Tesla grappled with a fire at its European factory, global shipping disruption and growing competition. Tesla has cut prices repeatedly in response to increased competition from rivals such as BYD but demand in key markets like China has fallen. Tesla's shares have lost almost a third of their value since the start of this year."

The ""empowering"" event raised money for charity Breast Friends as it showcased the shop's latest fashion collection. Last Thursday's sold-out show saw survivors celebrate their ""new normal"", while being cheered on by friends and family who were urged to sing along. Organisers said the event raised £2,000 for the charity which offers peer support to people with breast cancer. Speaking ahead of the event, organisers Sara Murphy and Zoe Bounds told BBC Radio York how the idea for the York show came about. The pair - who have both previously received a breast cancer diagnosis - met on a course in 2019. Sara recalls the group being told they could enter a draw to be picked to model in a breast cancer survivor fashion show in London. ""I looked at Zoe and said, 'but look at all of these fabulous women in this room - we don't need to go to London'."" Sara, who previously worked in the lingerie department at Browns, already had friends in the retail industry and was able to get in touch with a former colleague at the department store and organise the show, which has taken place since 2019 during York Fashion Week. Nearly all the models come from Breast Friends, a peer support group which brings together people who have received a diagnosis of breast cancer at some point in their lives. ""We just support each other,"" explains Zoe. ""We have all been there and heard the words 'you've got cancer'."" ""So, we've got people that have had a lot of treatment, we've got people who have just had surgery - it doesn't matter what treatment you've had, it's that you've heard those words."" Some of this year's models were newcomers to the fashion runway, while others are modelling for the second time. ""It's just amazing,"" said Sara. ""Last year one girl nearly vomited before she went on and thought she couldn't do it, but this year, when I put the plea out, she was one of the first people who said they wanted to do it. ""So she will have a completely different experience to what she had last year. It's just great."" The show is intended to show normal women celebrating their bodies after cancer. Zoe believes those who try to go back to being exactly the same person they were before a cancer diagnosis are ""probably going to be disappointed"". ""I get to see these women who have been through so much - their bodies have changed, the control has been taken away from them and they're trying to find a new normal,"" she said. ""Once you've heard those words, you can't go back to normal."" All the money raised will fund Breast Friends - jokingly dubbed ""the best support group you never wanted to join"" by Zoe and Sara - to ensure that anyone with a breast cancer diagnosis can enjoy meeting up with women in a similar position, no matter their financial status.

Concerns were initially raised by the early-risers on NBC's Today Show, which broke the news . In the absence of an official fix, those losing sleep over the problem can try a few simple solutions. One is to guard against human error - so double check the phone's alarm settings and ensure the volume is turned up. Others though have pointed the finger at Apple designers, saying a quirk of the iPhones' "" attention aware features "" could be to blame. When active, these enable an iPhone to check whether a person is paying attention to their device and - if they are - to take action automatically, such as lowering the volume sound of alerts, including alarms. They are available on iPhone X or later, and iPad Pro 11-inch or iPad Pro 12.9-inch, Apple says. Some TikTokkers suggested that if a slumbering user's face were turned towards the screen of a bedside iPhone then, depending on the phone's settings, the features could be activated and alarms silenced. Apple says it hopes to remedy the issue rapidly. But, until then, its time zone-spanning customer base may need to dust off a bit of retro tech, and swap TikTok for the more old-fashioned - but dependable - tick-tock of an alarm clock."

Eden Golan was performing her song Hurricane ahead of Thursday's semi-final in Malmo, Sweden. In a statement, she said she was ""proud to represent my country"". There have been several campaigns to block Israel from taking part in this year's contest following the outbreak of war in the Middle East, and thousands of people joined pro-Palestinian protests in the city on Thursday. But the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which hosts the event, has ruled Israel is allowed to compete. After Wednesday's dress rehearsal, several videos surfaced on social media from audience members who had recorded Golan being booed by some members of the crowd. Israel is currently engaged in a military campaign in Gaza, which they launched as a response to Hamas' cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. More than 34,840 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel is free to compete in Eurovision as it is a member of the EBU. Speaking on Sunday, the deputy director general of the EBU, Jean Philip De Tender, said if you ""exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take"", because it considers itself as an apolitical organisation. He added: ""We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war."" Golan was requested to change her original track, entitled October Rain, after it caused controversy. The song was thought to allude to Hamas kidnapping and killing Israelis and was then changed to Hurricane , which was approved by the EBU. Golan's team say the 20-year-old has been confined to her hotel room after a series of threats against the Israeli delegation. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation, which organises the country's Eurovision entry, says it has complained to the EBU about the booing and asked it to prevent a repeat of the incident. Eurovision organisers liaised with Swedish police to bring in reinforcements from Denmark and Norway, as they were expecting protests in the city ahead of Israel’s semi-final performance. A heavy police presence has now arrived in the city, as demonstrators gathered with Palestinian and LGBTQ+ flags on Thursday afternoon. Whilst performances from musicians were taking place,  smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off in the city’s central square. Protestors have also been carrying signs displaying images of Gazan civilians who have been injured in the conflict. Eurovision's 2023 winner Loreen told the BBC she understood why people were protesting. ""All of us are affected by what’s going on [but] we don’t know what to do, because it’s such a complex situation,"" the Swedish singer said. ""Some react with aggression, some cry, some shut down. We are different in that way, so I understand where it [the protesting] comes from.” But Loreen argued that booing Golan was ""not fair"" and ""unconstructive"". Elsewhere, organisers apologised on Tuesday after a semi-final performer displayed a pro-Palestinian symbol. Former Swedish contestant Eric Saade, whose father is a Palestinian from Lebanon, wore a keffiyeh - a type of scarf commonly worn by Palestinians - on his arm. A spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: ""The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. ""All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event."" Saade later said on his Instagram story the scarf was ""just my way of showing a part of my origin... I got that keffiyeh from my dad when I was a little boy, to never forget where the family comes from"". Fans were also warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags into the audience at the Malmö Arena. Israel's participation has been one of the main talking points at this year's Eurovision. Ireland's contestant Bambie Thug told reporters they were ""ordered"" to remove political gestures from an outfit ahead of the semi-final performance. Their costume had originally included an ancient Celtic writing known as Ogham - which they said had spelt ""ceasefire"" and ""freedom for Palestine"". The UK's entrant, Olly Alexander, has previously called for an ""immediate and lasting ceasefire"" in Gaza, but refused calls to boycott the event. In December he signed a statement accusing Israel of genocide in the war – an accusation which Israel has vehemently rejected."

She's learnt to trust her instincts. It's why when Russian forces entered her home village of Ocheretyne in eastern Ukraine, she and her family decided it was time to go. However, under heavy shelling, Lidiia soon became separated from her relatives, so started walking west in her slippers. ""I took a stick and a plank of wood [for support] and made my way,"" she told the BBC. ""My legs were carrying me somehow; I wasn't carrying them!"" She would end up walking 10km (6 miles) until she was picked up by Ukrainian police. ""There's nothing left! It's all upside down!"" she could be seen telling her much-needed ride in a released video. The village she left behind is gradually being turned into a hellscape by approaching Russian troops. The closer they get, the more intense the artillery fire becomes. Entire apartment blocks and houses are slowly turning to rubble and dust. ""As I started walking, I had to lie down a couple of times,"" says Lidiia. ""I once lost balance and fell into the grass. I had a sleep, and then carried on walking."" Lidiia explains one of the officers asked how old she was. ""I said I was 48 or 49, he didn't believe me!"" she says with a chuckle. She was eventually taken to a shelter for some rest, before being reunited with her granddaughter, Svitlana. ""I'm so happy my grandmother is here!"" says Svitlana, who's sat next to Lidiia on our video call. ""We'd been looking for her for a long time!"" Extraordinary as Lidiia's journey was, she couldn't escape a telling off from her younger relative. ""I won't repeat this,"" she concedes. ""Oh no, don't do that again!"" was Svitlana's stern reply.

Both rely on data centres - warehouses full of computer systems. Chief executive John Pettigrew said the power those data centres use would increase six-fold in the next decade. He said the grid was becoming ""constrained"" and ""bold action"" was needed to create a network able to cope with ""dramatically"" growing demand. ""Future growth in foundational technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing will mean larger scale, energy-intensive computing infrastructure,"" Mr Pettigrew said. The National Grid boss said in a speech on Tuesday, shared on LinkedIn , that now was ""a pivotal moment"" for grid transformation - with rising demand for energy-hungry technologies and more people opting for heat pumps or electric cars. ""Today, just like in the 1950s, we find ourselves with a network that's constrained,"" he said. ""Demand on the grid is growing dramatically, and forecast to double by 2050 as heat, transport and industry continue to electrify."" The high-voltage transmission network of cables and pylons that make up the UK's ""supergrid"" is now more than 70 years old. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in line with global targets, grid operators are under pressure to deliver upgrades to current infrastructure that can meet higher consumer demand for electricity in future and do so sustainably by connecting to renewable energy sources. We are at ""a moment in time that requires innovative thinking and bold actions to create a transmission network for tomorrow's future,"" Mr Pettigrew said. Most observers agree that whatever that future looks like, data centres will be a part of it. They have become integral to our modern lives and technologies, operating as a physical home to our digital information stored in the so-called ""cloud"" and other forms of IT equipment that power services and platforms. But all that computing power comes at an environmental cost. Some studies have warned that the AI industry alone could consume as much energy as a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 . The sector has been enjoying an economic boom after the launch of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and image-making tools such as Midjourney. Concern over their energy use and demands on infrastructure has increased in recent years. Official data showed that in the Republic of Ireland, which is home to the European headquarters of several big tech firms such as Google and Facebook-parent Meta, data centres accounted for nearly a fifth of all electricity used in 2022 . The amount of electricity being used by data centres in the country has risen by 400% since 2015 and ignited debate about capacity. Meanwhile, quantum computers, which process data differently to regular computers and can complete complex calculations very quickly, are still mostly being used experimentally to see what they can do. But it is hoped in future they could secure scientific breakthroughs and advance secure methods of communication."

It's part of the culture. A test of lyrical skill and a declaration of superiority that has produced hundreds of classic ""diss tracks"", from 2Pac's Hit 'Em Up to Jay-Z's Takeover. The latest beef originally erupted between three of hip-hop's biggest stars - Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole - all triggered by a seemingly innocuous lyric praising their respective careers. As tensions grew, Cole dropped out of the fight. However, Drake and Kendrick continue to battle with increasing ferocity - levelling life-changing accusations against each other in a flurry of tracks. Here's a guide to the battle's history, its fire starters, flashpoints and future. Drake (above left) - the Canadian actor-turned-musician whose vulnerable blend of rap and R&B has made him the most commercially successful hip-hop artist of the 21st Century. Among his multi-platinum hits are tracks like Hotline Bling, One Dance and Hold On We're Going Home. Kendrick Lamar (centre) - A Compton-born rapper whose compelling rhymes and conceptual vision have seen him named the best rapper of his generation. One of the most inventive lyricists in the game, he tackles big topics like police brutality, black self-worth and his own internal conflicts. In 2018, he became the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for music. J Cole (right) - Born in Germany and raised in North Carolina, J Cole was mentored by Jay-Z and went on to score hits with songs like Middle Child and Deja Vu. But he grew disenchanted with the trappings of commercial success and began to forge his own path with more introspective, analytical songs, resulting in some of the most popular and successful music of his career. When Kendrick Lamar was a young up-and-comer, Drake offered him a helping hand by inviting him onto his Take Care album, and giving him an opening spot on his 2012 Club Paradise Tour. But in 2013, after the success of Lamar's debut record Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, he made his ambitions clear. During a guest verse on Big Sean's Control, he called out Drake, J Cole, Meek Mill, Mac Miller, Pusha T and a host of other rappers, warning them: ""I got love for you all, but I'm trying to murder you."" Asked about the diss, Drake told Billboard Magazine: ""I didn't really have anything to say about it. It just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That's all it was. ""I know good and well that [Lamar]'s not murdering me, at all, in any platform. So when that day presents itself, I guess we can revisit the topic."" The rappers traded a few jibes over the next few years (Lamar memorably boasted that he'd ""tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes"" during the BET hip-hop awards) but it never seemed particularly serious. The initial spark was a gesture towards unity, rather than division. In October last year, Drake released his eighth album For All The Dogs, which featured a collaboration with J Cole called First Person Shooter. In one verse, Cole suggested that he, Drake and Kendrick were the ""big three"" of the current era of hip-hop. ""Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot [Kendrick]? Is it Aubrey [Drake]? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league."" The song debuted at the top of the US singles chart, becoming Drake's 13th and Cole's first number-one song. The achievement meant Drake tied with Michael Jackson for the most number one singles by a male solo artist. A week later, Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer replaced them at number one, and the moment seemed to have passed. But privately, Kendrick had taken note - and he wasn't happy. In March 2024, producer Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You. Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive. With a tightly-wound, expletive-laden delivery, he took aim at Cole's verse, claiming there was no ""big three - it's just big me"". He went on to call Drake and Cole's best verses insubstantial - ""a light pack"" - and declared he was the Prince to Drake's Michael Jackson. The power of the verse can't really be conveyed in print, but when it ends with Lamar promising to put all of Drake and J Cole's ""dogs"" in the ""pet sematary"" - the name of a Stephen King 1983 horror novel - you know a fuse has been lit. (NB: Lamar doesn't mean literal pet dogs, but the rappers' nearest and dearest. The lyric doubles up as a reference to Drake's album title, For All The Dogs) It's worth noting that the placement of Lamar's verse is also significant, as Metro Boomin' is a former Drake collaborator who fell out with the Canadian star. Metro, whose real name is Leland Wayne (more on him later), produced the majority of Drake's 2015 album What A Time To Be Alive, but a promised sequel never materialised, allegedly leading to bad blood between the pair. In 2022, the producer removed Drake from a song called Trance, and unfollowed him on Instagram. Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse in a concert in Florida, with a pugnacious message to the crowd. ""A lot of people ask me how I'm feeling,"" he said. ""I'ma let you know I'm feeling. ""I got my [expletive] head up high, my back straight, I'm 10 [expletive] toes down in Florida and anywhere else I go. And I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!"" Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill from his surprise album Might Delete Later. ""I got a phone call, they say that somebody dissing / You want some attention, it come with extensions,"" he rapped. ""He still doing shows but fell off like The Simpsons."" He continued by critiquing Kendrick's discography, calling his debut a ""classic"", but his most recent effort - a sprawling double album called Mr Morale and the Big Steppers - ""tragic"". ""Your third [album] was massive and that was your prime,"" he continued, ""I was trailing right behind and I just now hit mine."" He finished up by saying he still respected Lamar, but wouldn't hesitate to destroy him if the insults continued. ""Push come to shove on this mic I will humble him."" Almost immediately after releasing 7 Minute Drill, Cole realised it had been a huge ""mis-step"". Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness. ""I ain't gonna lie to y'all the past two days felt terrible,"" he told the audience, explaining that he'd caved into pressure to respond to Lamar's diss. The result, he said, was the ""lamest, goofiest"" thing he'd ever recorded. Like a true rap arsonist, Drake tried to reignite the fire Cole had extinguished. On April 13, he released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists. ""Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/Then we need a verse for the Swifties,"" he cajoled. He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him. ""Pipsqueak, pipe down, you ain't in no big three/SZA got you wiped down/Travis got you wiped down/ [21] Savage got you wiped down."" He also tagged Future, The Weeknd and Rick Ross in the song. Within hours of Drake's diss, Rick Ross shot back in a track called Champagne Moments, alleging the star had undergone plastic surgery - including a nose job, fake abs and a Brazilian Butt Lift. The accusation resulted in Drake's mum texting him to ask if the rumours were true. He shared their exchange on Instagram, marking the point where this rap beef went past its sell-by date. Then, on 21 April, Kanye West sided with Kendrick Lamar, releasing a remix of Like That where he took aim at Drake's major label record deal, suggesting he'd been short-changed. And he dismissed Drake and Cole's lyrics, rapping: ""Y'all so out of sight, out of mind/I can't even think of a Drake line."" Drake's attention, however, was solely focused on Lamar… The Canadian goaded his Compton adversary by dropping yet another diss track. Called Taylor Made Freestyle, it suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department. Adding insult to injury, Drake used artificial intelligence to deliver the insults in the voices of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Following complaints from Shakur's estate, the song was removed from Drake's social media feeds . Kendrick finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute diss track at the end of April. Titled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it read like a laundry list of complaints against his sparring partner. Lamar called Drake ""predictable"", a ""master manipulator"" and an ""habitual liar"". He also repeated Rick Ross's dig about Drake's fake abs, and called the star's parenting skills into question. But mostly, he said he really, really didn't like Drake. ""Let me say I'm the biggest hater,"" he rapped. ""I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress."" Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA. In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information. ""You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it."" Lamar's accusation that Drake ""don't know nothin'"" about raising a son appears to have rankled. On Saturday 4 May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights. ""You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad,"" he declared. ""I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad."" Among the song's most shocking allegations, Drake speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation). Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: ""You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name"". Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members - his mother, his father and his six-year-old son, Adonis. To each of them, he listed a litany of the rapper's supposed failures. Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs. Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his ""hidden daughter"" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a ""shambles"" Lamar upped the ante even further, on a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women. ""Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,"" he rapped. Drake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof, - with the implication that there was none. ""Drake is not a name that you gonn' see on no sex offender list, easy does it / You mentioning A minor … B sharp and tell the fans: Who was it?"" He also suggested that many of Lamar's claims had been deliberately planted by a fake informant, in the hope the star would unwittingly rap about them. ""The one's that you're getting your stories from, they're all clowns,"" Drake rapped. ""We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/A daughter that's 11 years old, I bet he takes it."" The war of words has quietened for now, but it feels like an uneasy silence. Will either star be able to walk away? Whatever happens, the feud has been good for business. Both Push Ups and Like That are safely nestled in the US and UK charts, with the latest diss tracks certain to follow. And while the question of ""who won"" still lingers, Billboard magazine reports that streams of Lamar's back catalogue have increased by 49% since the weekend, while Drake's have dropped by 5%. Lamar's pop-orientated Not Like Us, with is potentially libellous hook, has also become a club hit - picking up 21 million streams in its first three days of release. There are also a lot of conspiracy theories flying around - the main one being that Universal Music stepped in to stop the feud. TMZ has run a report saying that's not true, however. Things took a darker turn on Tuesday, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot. It's not clear whether the incident was connected to the rappers' feud, but the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London certainly was. Meanwhile, there are signs that some listeners are growing tired of the constant back and forth. ""This whole feud has started to reveal itself to be an ouroboros of attention and social-media commentary more than any actual referendum on two rappers' abilities,"" wrote Rolling Stone magazine's senior music editor Jeff Ihaza in an opinion column on 2 May. ""It feels like such a colossal waste of energy."""

It can spot signs of cancer that doctors often miss , appear to wax lyrical about how it ""feels"" , decipher ancient texts that have flummoxed researchers, predict the weather and even help us unravel animal communication . In many respects, artificial intelligence (AI) has become so advanced it's more interesting to examine the things it can’t do. Despite AI's world-bending abilities, machines still pale in comparison to the human mind on a host of tasks. Even algorithms built to replicate the function of the human brain – known as neural networks – are relatively unsophisticated compared to the inner workings of our minds. ""A grand mystery in the study of intelligence is what gives us such big advantages over AI systems,"" says Xaq Pitkow, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies the intersection of AI and neuroscience. ""The brain has a lot of deep neurological structures related to different functions and tasks, like memory, values, movement pattens, sensory perception and more."" These structures let our minds dip into different kinds of thinking to solve different kinds of problems. It's what gives humanity the edge over the robots, for now. The AI algorithms that dominate the market are essentially prediction machines. They crunch massive amounts of data and analyse patterns, which allows them to identify the most likely answer to a given question. On a fundamental level, much of human cognition centres around prediction, too, Pitkow says, but the mind is built for levels of reasoning, flexibility, creativity and abstract thinking that AI still hasn't replicated. AI works well enough that conversations with chatbots, like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini , can feel like talking to a real human being who can deliver plausible – if often inaccurate – answers to any question. But just how capable are modern AIs? Even the people who build this technology aren't always sure of its limitations. Think about social problems, such as having to apologise to someone you have offended. Is AI ready to take the job of a talented musician? What about telling a joke, or coming up with a creative recipe? Chefs and comedians spend years honing their skills in these areas through practice, instinct and trial and error.  How would a machine measure up, and why? These are the questions AI v the Mind will answer. In this ongoing series, we'll probe a different aspect of human cognitive abilities each month to see how an AI compares. We will pit a human expert against an AI tool on key tasks – can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? This series will aim to explore just where the limits of cutting-edge AI lie, and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. Look out for the first article coming on 15 May.

Carol had the money stolen from two accounts - one with a bank and one with an electronic money institution (EMI). But while the bank refunded her within 24 hours, it took her 18 months and a ruling from the financial ombudsman to get a full refund from the EMI. New regulations due to come into effect in October will offer far stronger protections to most victims of fraud. With less than six months to go, the financial watchdog, the Payments Systems Regulator, is warning smaller firms, including EMIs, to make sure ""their houses are in order"". EMIs are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, but cannot describe themselves as banks because they do not have a banking licence. Some of the biggest and most well-known EMIs include Revolut and Wise. In October 2022, Carol was targeted by criminals using the so-called ""energy rebate scam"" , which exploited people's concerns in the run-up to a sharp rise in the cost of energy. By innocently responding to a text message, Carol unwittingly gave scammers just a handful of personal details, which they then used to manipulate and trick her into thinking her money was at risk. Following up with phone calls purporting to be from her bank's specialist fraud team, the criminals groomed Carol and took control of her accounts. ""I was thinking about it all the time and I couldn't sleep at night,"" says Carol, who is from Hove, East Sussex. She had nearly £17,000 stolen from her Santander account and £63,000 taken from her account with Tide, an EMI. In Carol's case, she says the difference in how she was treated by her bank, Santander, and her EMI, Tide, could not have been more stark. ""The difference... was like night and day,"" says Carol. ""The bank was professional, they sent me details of remote access scams, they said that's what had happened. [It felt to me like] the EMI basically had no systems in place."" Santander refunded the money the next day and apologised. After six weeks Tide refunded £13.10, saying that was all it had been able to recover, and closed the case. It recovered a further £20,000 two months later but only refunded the remaining £43,000 in April this year - 18 months on from when the fraud took place - after Carol took her case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which ruled in her favour and ordered Tide to refund the money, plus thousands of pounds in interest. Carol's experience is exactly why the Payment Systems Regulator is bringing in changes this October under the Mandatory Reimbursement Requirement. Claire Simpson from the watchdog told the BBC these new rules will mean victims of fraud are all treated the same, a so-called ""equivalence of service"", regardless of where they keep their money. ""This is really big. We think this is a really, really significant step in both protecting customers from becoming victims of fraud in the first place by making sure that [firms] are incentivised to protect their customers, but also to ensure that when customers do become victims of fraud they are reimbursed in all but exceptional circumstances."" ""This is a complete change in the landscape. It's incentivising these firms to stop fraud before it happens to us,"" said Arun Chauhan, a solicitor and trustee of the Fraud Advisory Panel. ""The smaller firms (EMIs) are growing very quickly, they have some great products. But the people who look at the fraud - there aren't enough of them - so that's where they're having to up their game.

With elections looming in the EU and elsewhere, officials said they would assess whether the company's approach to moderating disinformation on Facebook and Instagram breached EU law. Among the Commission's concerns is Meta's oversight of its advertising tools, and whether they had been exploited by ""malicious actors."" The probe will also examine whether Meta is being transparent enough over its moderation of political content and accounts. “We have a well-established process for identifying and mitigating risks on our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement. ""We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.” The company is one of several tech firms designated ""very large online platforms"" (VLOPs) under the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA). VLOPs face fines of up to 6% of their annual turnover if they do not meet tougher content moderation requirements. This includes taking action to prevent manipulation of elections and disinformation. The Commission says it suspects Meta's current methods for moderating disinformation and political adverts do not comply with DSA obligations. It is concerned about the impact this may have on the upcoming electoral cycle, with the European Parliament elections taking place in June. ""This Commission has created means to protect European citizens from targeted disinformation and manipulation by third countries,"" said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""If we suspect a violation of the rules, we act. This is true at all times, but especially in times of democratic elections."" The four concerns at the heart of the EU Commission's investigation are: A European Commission official said it believed Meta's current approach to moderating advertisements did not meet DSA requirements. It cited findings by non-profit research organisation, AI Forensics, that a Russian influence campaign had been running adverts across the firm's platforms. AI Forensics said it uncovered a network of 3,826 pages spreading ""pro-Russian propaganda"" and the campaign had reached 38 million users between August 2023 and March 2024. It said less than 20% of the ads had been moderated by Meta as political. Meta says it has been taking action against the ""Doppelganger"" campaign since first exposing it in 2022 and it now sees less user engagement as a result. The Commission has given the firm five days to respond to a request for information about tools for journalists and researchers to monitor content on Facebook and Instagram during upcoming elections. It said it was concerned by Meta's approach to CrowdTangle - a public tool providing data and insights into Facebook and Instagram content engagement. The firm announced in March that it will no longer be available from 14 August, but says it is building new tools to provide wider access to platform data. The EU Commission's investigation follows its launch of a similar probe into disinformation on X (formerly Twitter) in March ."

Logistics vessels and personnel can be seen assembling the pier from steel segments, next to a US Navy ship. Costing about $320m (£255m), the pier and a causeway attached to the shore should be operational in a week. The goal is to deliver aid equivalent to as many as two million meals a day to Gaza to help avert a famine there. A UN-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in northern Gaza by May. ""Right now, you're seeing construction of that floating, temporary pier, and then, you'll start to see construction of the causeway,"" US defence department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters in Washington on Monday. ""Eventually, that causeway will be... pushed into the coastline and secured by the [Israel Defense Forces],"" she added. The pier will be ready a week from now, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. The UN has said a maritime corridor can never be a substitute for delivery by land, and land routes are the only way to bring in the bulk of supplies needed. Satellite images published by Planet Labs meanwhile appeared to show the pier was being built next to the USNS Benavidez, a Military Sealift Command roll-on/roll-off ship, 11km (7 miles) north-west of the coast of northern Gaza. A senior US military official said last week that the Israeli military's security role meant ""no US boots will be on the ground"" as part of the mission to construct and operate what is known officially as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS. An unnamed ""third party"" would also be driving aid lorries down the causeway, the official added. Hundreds of sailors and soldiers involved in the operation will live and sleep aboard a British Navy logistical support ship, RFA Cardigan Bay, which has been deployed to the area. On Saturday, the IDF confirmed that the Israeli Navy would ""secure the forces"" operating the pier and said it was ""committed to increasing the amount of humanitarian aid transferred daily into Gaza"". A senior Hamas official told the Associated Press last week that the group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the US - rejected ""any non-Palestinian presence in Gaza, whether at sea or on land"" and would ""deal with any military force present in these places… as an occupying power"". He spoke a day after Israel said ""terrorists"" had fired mortars at the site during a visit by UN personnel. No injuries were reported. The IDF also released photos and videos of what it described as the ""extensive preparations"" being carried out by its forces at a 67 acre (0.27 sq km) holding area where aid from the floating pier will be brought. The site is just inland from the makeshift jetty built by the US charity World Central Kitchen in March for a maritime corridor that was suspended after seven of its aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike. The US military official said the floating pier should be able to handle about 90 lorry loads of aid per day initially, and then quickly scale up to about 150 lorry loads. A lorry can typically carry about 20 tonnes of supplies. The UN has blamed the severe food shortage on Israeli restrictions on deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order. On Friday, the UN said a daily average of 192 aid lorries entered Gaza during April via the Egyptian-controlled Rafah and Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossings, which are in southern Gaza. The figure did not cover two recently-opened Israeli-controlled entry points in central and northern Gaza. Israeli defence ministry body Cogat said an average of 350 lorries entered Gaza daily through all crossings in the week beginning 7 April. It has insisted that Israel is not limiting aid deliveries and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute it to those in need inside Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Timur Ivanov, who denies the charges, is accused of accepting bribes ""on a particularly large scale"". Appointed to the defence ministry in 2016, Mr Ivanov, 47, has been responsible for Russia's military infrastructure projects. Activists have long criticised the levels of alleged corruption in Russia. However, such high profile cases have been rare since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Mr Ivanov is considered an ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and has worked with him for many years. He was previously deputy prime minister of the Moscow region, where Mr Shoigu briefly served as governor. The Kremlin has rejected reports in some Russian media that the real reason for Mr Ivanov's arrest was that he was suspected of treason. ""There are many different interpretations around all this now... You need to focus on official information,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He also stated that President Vladimir Putin had been notified of Mr Ivanov's detention in advance. In 2022, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), the group founded by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, accused Mr Ivanov of participating in ""corruption schemes during construction in the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia"". In particular, it said he had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, much of which was destroyed by Russian bombing in the months following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Basmanny district court in Moscow remanded him in jail for two months on charges of entering into a criminal conspiracy with third parties in his role of supervising the construction and overhaul of defence ministry facilities. If found guilty he could face up to 15 years in jail. A second man, Sergei Borodin, who was described as a friend of the Mr Ivanov, also appeared in court on Moscow on similar charges. Mr Ivanov denied the allegations made against him by Russia's Investigative Committee . The section of Russia's criminal code under which Mr Ivanov was detained - Part 6 of article 290 - applies when a suspected bribe exceeds one million roubles (£8,620; $10,700). Mr Ivanov's arrest marks a rare move against a member of Russia's governing elite, many of whom are believed to have used their positions to amass vast personal fortunes. Some Russian commentators have said the arrest will be a blow to Mr Shoigu. ""If he can't manage it, he will be next to fall. This person is 100% his man,"" one anonymous source told a popular military Telegram channel. Mr Ivanov has been sanctioned by the US and UK and is the subject of a travel ban and asset freeze imposed by the European Union , which describes him as being ""tenth in the overall hierarchy of the Russian military leadership""."

The 4ft (1.21m) sketch of the 1980s film character, Robocop, was done by Dave Hodges when he was just 13. Lisa Young, who now lives in the house in Anlaby, East Yorkshire, uncovered the drawing while decorating. With the help of a community Facebook group, she found the artist - now living in Australia. Ms Young, 53, said: ""I was stripping the wallpaper. When I uncovered the picture, I was impressed. “A 13-year-old little boy doing his thing, with his brother. It was nice to uncover it.” The drawing was signed ""Drawn by David Hodges aged 13, 14/7/91"". Daughter Chloe, 22, posted an appeal online and discovered a lot of people in Anlaby knew Mr Hodges and that he showed his artwork on social media. “Someone sent the link to his Instagram account,” she said. “I had a look and sent it straight to my mum. He is amazing! Just the stuff that he draws is incredible.” Mr Hodges, 46, now a married father-of-two, said he was surprised his childhood artwork had survived. He even remembered doing the drawing on his brother's bedroom wall before his mother decorated. “I was a 13-year-old boy and Robocop was an amazing film back then,"" he recalled. ""I did think someone will find this, one day. I didn’t think it would take 33 years!"" Mr Hodges added: ""I remember, after drawing the head and taking ages, my brother drew a stick man body under it. I remember being really frustrated."" Self-taught with the help of You Tube videos, Mr Hodges now produces photorealist pictures. He said: ""I always drew a lot as a kid and I was always quite good but never took it seriously. “Then in 2017 I drew a picture of my son. I really enjoyed it so started looking at technique – using You Tube videos."" Mr Hodge's current artwork is still a hobby, though he has sold some work and takes occasional commissions. He said: “Each picture can take anywhere between 30 and 40 hours. But with kids and working full time it’s hard to find the time. But I do enjoy it.” Mr Hodges' wall art will be covered up again as Ms Young continues her house renovations. But she intends to wallpaper that room so the Robocop wall art may be rediscovered in years to come."

A far-left activist group says it targeted the site because of the amount of resources and labour it uses. The company says car-making is unlikely to resume before next week, with the outage likely to cost it ""in the high nine-digit euro range."" Tesla wants to double the size of its German factory - a plan which is opposed by some environmentalists. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk used the German phrase ""extrem dumm"" - extremely stupid - to describe the targeting of the site. ""These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals,"" he wrote. In a letter published online, activists calling themselves the Volcano Group said they sabotaged production. An electricity pylon close to the plant caught fire, causing power outages in the factory and nearby towns. Tesla said workers had been sent home but its building was in a ""safe state"". The fire did not reach the electric car-maker's factory itself but did burn an electricity pylon and high-voltage wires. In its letter claiming responsibility for the attack, the Volcano Group said it sabotaged Tesla because it ate up resources and labour. It also accused Tesla of contaminating groundwater and using huge amounts of drinking water. State police have told the BBC they are currently examining the letter. ""The rule of law will react to such an act of sabotage with the utmost severity,"" said Interior Minister for Brandenburg state Michael Stuebgen after the attack took place on Tuesday morning. Some environmentalists are unhappy with the Berlin expansion plan because it would involve chopping down nearby trees. Around 100 people are camping in a forest near the factory. However, those green activists have distanced themselves from what has happened. One group, which calls itself Robin Wood, told the BBC it had ""nothing to do with the fire"". The Tesla factory currently makes around 500,000 cars a year - the Elon Musk-owned company wants to double that. Production is not expected to restart until next week, according to plant manager Andre Thierig. He added that the outage would cost ""in the high nine-digit Euro range"" after both power lines into the plant were broken."

In a world where pictures can be digitally altered with just a few clicks or even generated entirely from scratch by artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming ever harder to trust what our eyes see. The techniques used to manipulate images are so sophisticated that we have entered the era of the hyper-realistic fake. Such images can lead to the spread of misinformation and could even influence public opinion in important events such as elections . With a picture of the Princess of Wales and her children being withdrawn by news agencies amid concerns it had been ""manipulated "", the issue has been thrown into the spotlight like never before. The Princess of Wales later apologised for making the changes to the image, stating that ""like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing"". ( Learn more about how Kate's photo may have been altered in this analysis from BBC Verify . ) But is there anything we can do to spot an image that might have been altered or AI generated? Abnormal lighting is often a giveaway that a photograph has been altered. Check the points of light in people's eyes , for example; the source of light will often be reflected in their eyes. If the size and colour don't match with the location, or if they look different between the eyes, then you might have cause to be suspicious. The way subjects and objects appear in reflective surfaces in an image can also provide clues. Shadows of objects in the image may not line up if it has been pieced together from multiple pictures, although bear in mind that some pictures can be taken with multiple lighting sources. It's worth looking at the way light plays across a subject's face. If the Sun is behind them, for example, their ears might look red. Artificial intelligence can also produce incongruent lighting and shadows, but as algorithms improve, AI-generated faces are often perceived as being more real than human faces . Another tell-tale approach is to look for features that are hard to replicate. AI is currently poor at rendering hands and ears , mangling their shapes, proportions and even the number of fingers. These are the same features that often trouble artists, but as other aspects of AI-generated images of people become hyper-real, these inaccuracies create an uncanny valley that looks unnatural to our eyes. You might also like: Look out for unusual or unnatural positioning of limbs or clothing in an image, which can be a sign that a portion of it has been copied or manipulated in some way. But also remember that the flattening of the three dimensional world into a two dimensional image can make things look a little out of place at times too. One test to apply is to look at other elements of the image in the same field of focus and position. Do they look blurry compared to other features nearby in the same depth in the photograph , or are they being ruffled by a breeze in the same way? Hidden within the code of digital images are nuggets of information that can help to pinpoint a fake. Every time a digital camera snaps an image, metadata is written into the image file. Timestamps, for example, led to questions about whether President Donald Trump was in fact at work in the White House the day after revealing he had caught Covid-19 in October 2020. Every digital camera sensor features tiny manufacturing faults that lead to unique errors that leave a kind of ""fingerprint"" on pictures . This is then associated with a specific camera and can help to identify areas of a photograph that have been manipulated . The grain of an AI-generated image can also look peculiar . Internet companies such as Google have launched image verification tools that can help people to spot AI-generated images. Facebook and Instagram have started labelling AI-generated images that come from Meta's own systems and is planning to do the same for pictures generated by other companies' AI tools . -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Appropriately enough, it did so with the help of a ""goth gremlin goblin witch” - aka singer Bambie Thug, whose electro-metal anthem Doomsday Blue is now among the favourites to win. Other acts who made it through Tuesday's first semi-final included Croatia's Baby Lasagna and Finland's Windows95Man, as fans revelled in the year's most out there performances. However, it was bad news for Eurovision fanatics in Australia. Their act, Electric Fields, failed to qualify, as did entries from Moldova and Iceland. Meanwhile, organisers had to apologise after one of Tuesday's performers displayed a pro-Palestinian symbol. Eric Saade, who was among the show's opening acts, wore a keffiyeh - a type of scarf commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian - on his arm. A spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: ""The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. ""All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.""  Ahead of the event at Sweden's Malmö Arena, fans were warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags into the audience. Strict security checks were carried out on members of the audience. The run-up to the contest has been characterised by opposition to Israel's participation, amid concerns over the humanitarian cost of the war in Gaza. Ireland's Bambie told reporters they were ""ordered"" to remove political gestures from their outfit ahead of the semi-final performance. Their costume had originally included an ancient Celtic writing known as Ogham - which they said had spelt ""ceasefire"" and ""freedom for Palestine"". Ogham is an ancient Irish alphabet, represented by a series of marks on stones and it is the earliest written source of the Irish Language, dating back to the 4th Century AD. ""It was very important for me because I am pro-justice and pro-peace, unfortunately I had to change those messages today... [an] order from the EBU,"" Bambie said. Israel's representative, 20-year-old Eden Golan, has reportedly been confined to her hotel room while she is not performing, due to heightened security concerns. She will make her debut during Thursday's second semi-final. The political row did not overshadow Tuesday's opening semi-final, where 18 acts performed, including the UK's entrant Olly Alexander - who has previously called for ""an immediate and lasting ceasefire"" in Gaza, but refused calls to boycott the event. The singer put on an energetic performance of his synth-pop single Dizzy, using camera effects and intricate choreography to make it look as though he was in a spaceship hurtling towards Earth. Dressed in a white singlet, red trousers, and distressed boots, he danced so hard that the battery pack for his microphone detached from his costume. He was seen clasping it in his right hand for the final moments of the performance. Despite the mishap, the UK did not have to worry about the public vote on Tuesday. It is one of five countries that qualifies automatically for the final, due to its financial contribution to the contest. Sweden, who were last year's winners, also get a free pass. The 10 acts who succeeded in Tuesday's public vote were: Going home were Moldova, Iceland, Australia, Poland and Azerbaijan. The results were something of a shock for Iceland's Hera Björk and Moldova's Natalia Barbu. Both were former Eurovision contestants, who were hoping to capitalise on their association with the contest, and perhaps improve upon their previous scores. However, it was not to be. Their songs were ranked poorly with bookmakers and fans alike and, in the end, the public vote could not save them. Croatia's Baby Lasagna are currently the favourites, and they sailed through the semi-final with the agreeably daft foot-stomper Rim Tim Tagi Dim. The song tells the story of a farm boy setting out for the big city (sample lyric: “I’m a big boy now and I sold my cow”) - and is allegedly about the damaging effects of Croatia's brain drain. Equally entertaining is Finland's Windows95Man, who spends his stage time ""arguing"" with Eurovision officials about whether he can perform naked from the waist down. A well-known performance artist and DJ at home, he makes ample use of stage props to cover his modesty... before triumphantly donning a pair of jean-shorts for the song's climax.  Luxembourg, meanwhile, made an overdue return to Eurovision after a gap of 31 years. The country, which has won five times, pulled out after being relegated from the 1994 contest and resisted attempts to lure them back... until now. Marking the 40th anniversary of their last win, they entered the slinky pop anthem Fighter, sung by 23-year-old Tali Golergant - and duly went through to the final. Ireland will also be delighted by their success. Tied with Sweden as the most successful country in Eurovision history (with seven wins each), it has failed to qualify in eight of the last 10 competitions. The selection of Bambie Thug, a non-binary artist whose song dabbles in the occult, was condemned by some priests in the predominantly Catholic country - but its creative staging and unlikely fusion of musical genres have made it a favourite amongst fans. ""I wanted to showcase all the facets of myself like spoken word poetry, singing, jazzy crooning, metal, screaming, I squeeze it all in,"" Bambie told the BBC earlier this week. The first semi-final was themed around the idea that ""you don't have to win the contest to be a winner"". As a result, organisers asked back some of the competition's most famous runners-up, including Eleni Foureira (Cyprus, 2018), Eric Saade (Sweden, 2011) and Chanel (Spain, 2022) - all of whom have gone on to achieve international success. The trio opened the show with a medley of their Eurovision songs; while the interval saw the return of Sweden's Benjamin Ingrosso. The singer came seventh at the 2018 contest -  a respectable placing, unless you come from Europe's most competitive Eurovision participant. ""In Sweden, if you don't come top five, you're the worst, so I was a disappointment,"" Ingrosso recently told the official Eurovision Song Contest podcast . Despite the ignominy, his career has gone from strength to strength  - and he recently enjoyed a viral hit with the slinky pop song, Kite . But the real star of the half-time show was Ireland's Johnny Logan. The crooner was the first person ever to win Eurovision twice, with What's Another Year in 1980 and Hold Me Now in 1987. He travelled to Malmö to honour Swedish pop diva Loreen, who last year equalled his Eurovision record with her second victory. On stage, he sang a lush, orchestral version of her 2012 entry Euphoria. Behind the scenes, he has also praised Ireland's entry, calling Bambie Thug a potential winner. ""The one thing about the Eurovision Song Contest is that every year people try to copy the song that won before, because they think that’s the secret to winning it,"" he told Ireland's Sunday World newspaper . ""This year’s Irish entry doesn’t do that. It’s probably the best and most original entry that Ireland has had for as long as I can remember."" The audience will get to decide whether he's right at Eurovision's grand final on Saturday night. Before then, however, is Thursday's second semi-final. There, 16 acts will compete for the remaining 10 places in the contest - including hotly-tipped singers from Switzerland (Nemo), Israel (Eden Golan) and Greece (Marina Satti). Sweden is hosting the contest in the coastal city of Malmö. It follows in the footsteps of Liverpool, which held last year's competition on behalf of 2022 winners Ukraine, who were unable to do so during the ongoing war with Russia."

The tool, called Mia, was piloted alongside NHS clinicians and analysed the mammograms of over 10,000 women. Most of them were cancer-free, but it successfully flagged all of those with symptoms, as well as an extra 11 the doctors did not identify. At their earliest stages, cancers can be extremely small and hard to spot. The BBC saw Mia in action at NHS Grampian, where we were shown tumours that were practically invisible to the human eye. But, depending on their type, they can grow and spread rapidly. Barbara was one of the 11 patients whose cancer was flagged by Mia but had not been spotted on her scan when it was studied by the hospital radiologists. Because her 6mm tumour was caught so early she had an operation but only needed five days of radiotherapy. Breast cancer patients with tumours which are smaller than 15mm when discovered have a 90% survival rate over the following five years. Barbara said she was pleased the treatment was much less invasive than that of her sister and mother, who had previously also battled the disease. She told me she met a relative who expressed sympathy that Barbara had ""the Big C"". ""I said, 'it's not a big C, it's a very little one',"" she said. Without the AI tool's assistance, Barbara's cancer would potentially not have been spotted until her next routine mammogram three years later. She had not experienced any noticeable symptoms. Because it works instantly, tools like Mia also have the potential to reduce the waiting time for results from 14 days down to three, claims its developer Kheiron. None of the cases in the trial were analysed by Mia alone - each had a human review as well. Currently two radiologists look at each individual scan, but the hope is that one of them could one day be replaced by the tool, effectively halving the workload for each pair. Of the 10,889 women who participated in the trial, only 81 did not want the AI tool to review their scans, said Dr Gerald Lip, clinical director of breast screening in the north east of Scotland and the doctor who led the project. AI tools are generally pretty good at spotting symptoms of a specific disease, if they are trained on enough data to enable them to be identified. This means feeding the programme with as many different anonymised images of those symptoms as possible, from as diverse a range of people as possible. Getting hold of this data can be difficult because of patient confidentiality and privacy concerns. Sarah Kerruish, Chief Strategy Officer of Kheiron Medical, said it took six years to build and train Mia, which is run on cloud computing power from Microsoft, and it was trained on ""millions"" of mammograms from ""women all over the world"". ""I think the most important thing I've learned is that when you're developing AI for a healthcare situation, you have to build in inclusivity from day one,"" she said. Breast cancer doctors look at around 5,000 breast scans per year on average, and can view 100 in a single session. ""There is an element of fatigue,"" said Dr Lip. ""You get disruptions, someone's coming in, someone's chatting in the background. There are lots of things that can probably throw you off your regular routine as well. And in those days when you have been distracted, you go, 'how on earth did I miss that?' It does happen."" I asked him whether he was worried that tools like Mia might one day take away his job altogether. He said he believed the tech could one day free him up to spend more time with patients. ""I see Mia as a friend and an augmentation to my practice,"" Dr Lip said. Mia isn't perfect. It had no access to any patient history so, for example, it would flag cysts which had already been identified by previous scans and designated harmless. Also, because of current health regulation, the machine learning element of the AI tool was disabled - so it could not learn on the job, and evolve during its use. Every time it was updated it had to undergo a new review. The Mia trial is just one early test, by one product in one location. The University of Aberdeen independently validated the research, but the results of the evaluation have not yet been peer reviewed. The Royal College of Radiologists say the tech has potential. ""These results are encouraging and help to highlight the exciting potential AI presents for diagnostics. There is no question that real-life clinical radiologists are essential and irreplaceable, but a clinical radiologist using insights from validated AI tools will increasingly be a formidable force in patient care."" said Dr Katharine Halliday, President of the Royal College of Radiologists. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK said the increasing number of cancer cases diagnosed each year meant technological innovation would be ""vital"" to help improve NHS services and reduce pressure on its staff. ""More research will be needed to find the best ways to use this technology to improve outcomes for cancer patients,"" she added. There are other healthcare-related AI trials going on around the UK, including an AI tool by a firm called Presymptom Health which is analysing blood samples looking for signs of sepsis before symptoms emerge - but many are still in early stages without published results."

Dramatic footage showed police climbing a ladder to enter Hamilton Hall, which had been occupied at Columbia University, and later removing people handcuffed with zip ties. The university had earlier told any students involved to leave or face expulsion. Officials have said the building was cleared and no injuries were reported. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said on Wednesday that nearly 300 people in total were arrested - including 119 at Columbia University and 173 from the nearby City College of New York - on charges of trespassing, criminal mischief and burglary. The NYPD is still working to decipher who was affiliated with the university out of those who were arrested. At Wednesday's news conference, New York Mayor Eric Adams said students had a ""right to protest"". But he added: ""There's nothing peaceful about barricading buildings, destroying property or dismantling security cameras."" The demonstrators want the university to divest from Israel over its continuing deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. The Columbia protest is one of dozens across the country, including at campuses in Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, New Mexico, California, New Jersey, Connecticut and Louisiana, where police have arrested more than 1,000 protesters. The Columbia arrests came just before violence erupted over the war in Gaza at another campus hundreds of miles away on the West Coast. Lengthy clashes broke out early Wednesday morning between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California in Los Angeles, after school administrators moved to shut down an encampment it called ""unlawful"". Counter-demonstrators clad in black arrived at the campus around midnight local time, before trying to tear down barricades around the encampment, the LA Times reported. Video footage showed flares and fireworks being set off, while other clips showed scuffles between the groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the scenes ""abhorrent and inexcusable"" and said police officers had arrived at the campus. In New York, meanwhile, school officials authorised police officers to enter Hamilton Hall at Columbia University after student demonstrators inside defied a deadline to disperse. One student told the BBC that around 80-100 police stormed the building. Columbia said that after the hall was ""occupied, vandalised and blockaded, we were left with no choice"". In a letter to the New York Police Department (NYPD), President Minouche Shafik wrote that she requested police aid ""with the utmost regret"". Officers said they used flashbang grenades to ""disorient protesters"" as the raid commenced, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. Some students could be heard shouting ""Shame on you!"" at the officers as they entered the building around 21:30 EST. NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said those in the building tried to lock the police out, but officials were still able to gain access. Some students alleged that police clad in riot gear manhandled demonstrators as they stormed the building, with one telling the BBC that three people had been pushed down the stairs by NYPD officers. The interview was cut short moments later after an officer interrupted and slammed shut a window through which the conversation had been happening. NYPD assistant commissioner of public information, Carlos Nieves, defended the officers. He said that students had ""barricaded"" the doors to Hamilton Hall with ""conference tables, chairs or soda machines"". He alleged they had also blocked windows with newspaper so officers ""couldn't see"". Huge cheers of support by anti-war crowds were heard as the arrested students were marched off with their hands in zip ties. People also chanted: ""Let them go!"" The activists have been occupying a tent camp at the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan for nearly two weeks. All was relatively quiet on Columbia's campus on Wednesday as non-essential visitors are not allowed to enter. Some Columbia students could be seen packing up their possessions with the help of their parents. The school has gone fully remote, and it will retain NYPD officers on campus until 17 May. National politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting reports of antisemitism at some of the demonstrations. President Joe Biden earlier said demonstrations should be peaceful, but ""forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful - it is wrong"". His Democratic colleague, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, condemned the police response at Columbia and urged Mayor Eric Adams to find a ""de-escalatory path"". ""This is the opposite of leadership and endangers public safety,"" she wrote. ""A nightmare in the making. I urge the mayor to reverse course."" Another New York Democrat, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, attacked what he called ""the militarisation of college campuses"" by police."

Duvel said it was currently unable to give further details ""as the investigation into the cause of the cyber-attack is ongoing."" ""The built-in command systems and alarms in the IT-system worked well, so our IT department was immediately informed of the attack,"" the company said in a statement. ""The servers were immediately shut down, which also shut down production at the four Belgian production sites and the production site in Kansas City."" Duvel said that one plant, in Puurs-Sint-Amands in Belgium, was now back up and running, but production at the other four was still halted. Duvel, which also produces beers such as Chouffe, Vedett and Liefmans, was founded in 1871 and made €583m (£497m) in revenue in 2022. That year it produced around 230 million litres of beer. It is not yet known whether the supply of its products will be affected by this incident. The company told local media that it was a ransomware attack.

Twenty fire engines carrying more than 2,800 pieces of firefighting equipment such as ladders, boats and breathing kits are due to leave Kent on 30 April. More than 100 volunteers from 15 brigades from across England and Wales and from the organisation Fire Aid will travel to the war-torn country. Chris Philp, Home Office minister, said the ""barbaric invasion"" has ""taken a toll on the brave people of Ukraine’s"" fire services. Nearly 400 fire stations have been destroyed and 91 firefighters killed since the war began, according to the latest Home Office figures. It is hoped the donations - which include the vehicles - will provide a much-needed boost to the war-torn country's fire services. In total, 33 fire and rescue vehicles will form the convoy including two mechanics’ vehicles and one aerial ladder platform, which disperses water onto buildings from above. Road traffic collision equipment, fire and water PPE and safe working at height kits are among the other pieces of equipment being sent. The convoy is sponsored by the Home Office. Minister Mr Philp said: ""Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine has taken a toll on the brave people of Ukraine’s fire and rescue services. ""We are now in the third year of this senseless conflict and today’s donation shows our determination to support the people of Ukraine remains as strong as ever.""

Just 1,500 out of 150,000 people assessed have had financial redress from energy suppliers who forced-fitted the meters into their homes. Claire Coutinho said she had spoken to the regulator to sort compensation payouts ""as soon as possible"". But energy suppliers only believe about 2,500 people require compensation. Energy regulator Ofgem confirmed that about 150,000 cases had been ""reviewed"" so far by suppliers themselves, who have decided that just over 2,500 customers were entitled to payouts. Some 1,502 customers have been paid initial compensation payments totalling £342,450 between them, with suppliers setting aside a further £200,000 for another 1,000. Ofgem told all energy suppliers to review cases of people who were forced onto prepayment meters between the start of 2022 and the end of January 2023 to assess whether they required compensation. However, the regulator told the BBC that British Gas, the supplier found to be hiring agents who forced their way into the homes of vulnerable people to fit prepayment meters, against Ofgem rules , was not included in the compensation figures released so far. It said the supplier was not included in its review and was subject to a separate, ongoing investigation. The exposure of the practice in which vulnerable people had their homes broken into for meters to be fitted led to a public outcry. Asked on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg if the government was ""abandoning"" thousands of people due to the small number of compensation payouts to date, Ms Coutinho replied: ""No, absolutely not."" She said the situation was ""completely unacceptable"", adding she had spoken to Ofgem, who are overseeing compensation, to ""make sure that people can get the compensation as quickly as possible"". ""We're getting new figures in the coming months but we are ready to act to make sure that people can get that money,"" she added. Ofgem told the BBC it was working with suppliers to ""make sure they identify all eligible consumers and pay appropriate levels of compensation promptly"". It said it expected to update the number of cases where redress has been paid to customers by the end of June. The amounts paid to individual customers so far from each supplier varies, Ofgem said, adding that companies had compensated customers in different ways, including sending cheques, adding credit to the accounts, and writing off debt. Energy UK, the body which represents energy suppliers, told the BBC that companies had ""identified a small proportion of cases where the correct process wasn't followed and where the customers affected are being compensated as a result"". It said with energy debt at ""record levels"", prepayment meters had an ""important role to play in preventing customers falling further into arrears"". It said new rules mean there ""stronger safeguards"" in place governing forced meter installations, which it said ""will only take place after repeated attempts to contact the customer and a visit to the property to confirm suitability"". ""The Code of Practice also identifies those categories of vulnerable customers who will be exempt from any prepayment meter installation,"" a spokesperson added. Prepayment meters require customers to pay for their energy use in advance, either through accounts or by adding credit to a card in a convenience store or Post Office. About four million households have such meters in the UK. There are three types - key meters, smart card meters and smart prepayment meters. The first two work in a very similar way. They are most common in rented properties and having one is a more expensive method of paying for energy than by direct debit, but is sometimes the only option for people who have struggled to pay and are in debt to an energy supplier. For years, energy companies were able to force-fit prepayment meters into homes when bills went unpaid. This can be done remotely on a smart meter, or physically after a firm has been given a warrant to do so. The practice was halted when British Gas was exposed last year, but various suppliers have recently been given permission to resume the forced fitting of prepayment meters under stricter rules. Strict rules also apply that prevent energy suppliers moving an at-risk customer onto a prepayment meter if they are struggling to pay.

Interest rates affect mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what other banks charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, and the interest they pay on savings. The Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - the increase in the price of something over time . When inflation is high, the Bank - which has a target to keep inflation at 2%- may decide to raise rates. The idea is to encourage people to spend less, to help bring inflation down by reducing demand. Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. The Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 16 years. However, it was higher than this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and was 17% in November 1979 . There have been questions about why interest rates have not been cut, with inflation dropping sharply. Inflation was at 3.2% in March - down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. Further falls are expected. Following May's decision to keep interest rates at 5.25%, the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey said he was ""optimistic that things are moving in the right direction"". But he said the Bank needed to ""see more evidence"" that price rises had slowed further before cutting interest rates. It left open the possibility of an interest rate cut in June, after two sets of new figures for inflation and wages are published. However, a cut later in the summer is considered more likely. The Bank has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy - which has shown little sign of growth. Mortgages Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey . When interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.2 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their payments. More than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, any future deals are. Mortgage rates are much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. This means homebuyers and those remortgaging have to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 1.6 million deals will expire in 2024, according to banking trade body UK Finance. You can see how your mortgage may be affected by interest rate changes by using our calculator:           Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders could decide to put their rates up if they expect higher interest rates from the Bank of England. However, if rates fall, interest payments may get cheaper. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers can earn on their money. Individual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rates to customers. There are some good deals on the market and experts say customers should shop around, as money may be in accounts paying little or no interest. The UK's financial watchdog warned banks will face ""robust action"" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to customers . Interest rates have been increasing across the world over the past few years. However, in recent months, other central banks - including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank - have also paused their rate rises, with the next moves expected to be downwards. The UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies."

Rachel Goldberg-Polin's son Hersh, who turned 23 four days before he was kidnapped from the Nova festival on 7 October, was seen in captivity in a new video released last week . She described how she felt when she first watched it. ""As soon as I heard his voice I started to cry, because I haven't heard his voice in half a year. ""To see him moving, and to see that he is clearly medically compromised, and that he's fragile. His father Jon and I were both just crying, and I was holding my heart."" ""I don't even know what I was saying. I was just making noises and crying, and Jon was crying"". Hersh Goldberg-Polin was at the Nova music festival in a forested area close to the Gaza Strip when Hamas-led gunmen stormed Israel's border fence, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 360 of those killed were attending the festival event. Hersh managed to get several kilometres away from the festival site in a car, before seeking refuge in a roadside bomb shelter with several dozen others. But outside, Hamas gunmen gathered and began throwing in grenades. Before Wednesday, the last time he had been seen alive was in a Hamas video that showed him being loaded on to a pick-up truck, with part of his left arm missing. In the new video, posted to Hamas's Telegram account, Hersh lifts his arm to the camera to show a healed stump where his hand should be. He criticises Israel's military campaign in Gaza before speaking directly to his parents and two sisters, urging them to keep campaigning for his release. ""We're clearly very concerned about the injury,"" Mrs Goldberg-Polin told me. ""We've had several surgeons who have seen the video that say he needs another surgery immediately. If he was treated, it was an emergency treatment. He needs a second surgery at least."" ""He is considered in a fragile and compromised medical state, and so we're concerned about that."" As a 23-year-old man, Hersh would not be expected to be included in the next batch of hostages whose release is being discussed, which includes woman and the elderly. But those with medical conditions also fall into the category to be freed, and so the family hope that he will be included - although they have not had any confirmation. Mrs Goldberg-Polin says she is scheduled to meet the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, on his latest visit to Israel, which it is hoped will give further impetus to the negotiations. She had a clear message for all of the parties involved. ""I think that everyone here has leverage. Everyone is using their leverage. But are they using it to the maximum? The answer is clearly no. Because we still have 133 people there in Gaza. ""I am hopeful and optimistic. I'm really praying that all the parties, everyone decides that they're going to be courageous, be daring, and put an end to all the suffering in this region"". It is expected that Hamas will respond to the latest Israeli proposal in the next 24 hours. The hope is that it can provide a foundation to negotiate a concrete deal, and not be rejected outright. The details are yet to be officially confirmed but are believed to involve the release of 33 hostages during a five to six week ceasefire. An as-yet-unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. There is also believed to be a commitment to discuss a future end point for the war. But even as those discussions continue, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is planning a ground offensive in Rafah regardless of the outcome . Around 1.4 million displaced Palestinians are sheltering there after fleeing their homes during the heavy fighting in northern and central parts of Gaza. More than 34,500 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has been conducting a military campaign to destroy Hamas and free the hostages. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages - most of them women and children - in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails."

He played Captain Edward Smith in the 1997 Oscar-winning film and King Théoden in the Lord of the Rings. His breakout role was in 1982 BBC TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff, where he portrayed Yosser Hughes, a character who struggled - and often failed - to cope with unemployment in Liverpool. He died early on Sunday morning, his agent Lou Coulson confirmed. With him at the time were his fiancee Alison and his son Gabriel. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, the actors who played the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, paid tribute to their co-star at Comic Con in Liverpool. Astin began by saying: ""We love him. He was intrepid, he was funny, he was gruff, he was irascible, he was beautiful."" Boyd recounted watching the trilogy with Monaghan, saying: ""I don't think anyone spoke Tolkien's words as great as Bernard did. He would break my heart. He will be solely missed."" Alan Bleasdale, who wrote Boys from the Blackstuff, said Hill's death was a ""great loss and also a great surprise"". ""It was an astonishing, mesmeric performance - Bernard gave everything to that and you can see it in all the scenes. He became Yosser Hughes."" He added: ""I was desperate to work with him. Everything he did - his whole procedure for working, the manner in which he worked and his performance was everything that you could ever wish for. ""You always felt that Bernard would live forever. He had a great strength, physically and of personality."" Hill, who was from Manchester and lived in Suffolk, was due to return to TV screens in series two of The Responder, a BBC drama starring Martin Freeman, which begins airing on Sunday. Lindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, paid tribute to him, saying: ""Bernard Hill blazed a trail across the screen, and his long-lasting career filled with iconic and remarkable roles is a testament to his incredible talent."" ""From Boys from the Blackstuff, to Wolf Hall, The Responder, and many more, we feel truly honoured to have worked with Bernard at the BBC. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this sad time."" In Boys from the Blackstuff, Hill drew praise for his gritty portrayal of Yosser Hughes, an intense character who pleaded ""Gizza [give us a] job"" as he sought work. That show won a Bafta for best drama series in 1983, and in 2000 it was ranked seventh on a British Film Institute list of the best TV shows ever made. Another of Hill's memorable BBC TV performances came in the 2015 drama series Wolf Hall, adapted from Hilary Mantel's book about the court of Henry VIII. Hill portrayed the Duke of Norfolk - an uncle of Anne Boleyn and an enemy of Cardinal Wolsey. In Peter Jackson's epic trilogy The Lord of the Rings, Hill joined the cast for the second film, 2002's The Two Towers, and returned to the franchise for 2003's The Return Of The King, which picked up 11 Oscars. Other roles in Hill's decades-long career included the 1976 BBC TV series I, Claudius, an appearance in 1982's Gandhi, Shirley Valentine in 1989, The Scorpion King in 2002 and 2008 Tom Cruise film Valkyrie. He was meant to be at Comic Con Liverpool on Saturday, but had to cancel at the last minute, the convention said in a post on X. As news of his death broke, the organisers said on the platform they were ""heartbroken"" at Hill's death, and wished his family a ""lot of strength"". Scottish musician Barbara Dickson also paid tribute on X , saying he had been a ""really marvellous actor"". She added: ""It was a privilege to have crossed paths with him. RIP Benny x."""

The deadline passed on Friday for submissions to a UK government scheme to sell electricity from the project into the National Grid, with the next round of bids not until 2025. SSE is still awaiting a decision over the Berwick Bank project in the outer Firth of Forth, which could create more than 4,000 jobs. The news came as the Scottish government gave the go-ahead for the world’s largest floating wind farm near Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, which will primarily be used to power oil and gas platforms. Green Volt bosses said the project would place Scotland ""at the leading edge of a new floating wind sector"". Green Volt will provide 560MW of energy, while Berwick Bank would be one of the largest offshore wind developments in the world, generating up to 4.1GW of electricity - enough to power all of Scotland's homes twice over. SSE Renewables had targeted Berwick Bank to be generating power by the end of the decade. It is understood any further delay could impact the Scottish government's aim to build 11GW of new offshore wind by 2030. Net Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan last week told the Scottish parliament that an interim target to reduce carbon emissions by 75% by 2030 had been dropped due to the goal being ""out of reach"". The announcement resulted in the Scottish Greens clashing with the SNP, with the Greens to hold an extraordinary general meeting over the future of the power-sharing Bute House Agreement. This is yet more criticism of the Scottish government's climate change commitments with the massive Berwick Bank project still unsure of its future. They had been hoping to know by now whether they had consent from ministers who'd said they ""aim"" to make decisions on these large projects within 12 months.  It's now been 17. Consent times have become a huge issue for the industry.  Another project - GreenVolt - submitted its application a month after Berwick Bank but it has now been given the go-ahead. Making comparisons is difficult though.  Berwick Bank is much larger and is in a more sensitive area of sea close to where RSPB Scotland previously took ministers to court over the impact of turbines on migrating birds. What this is really about though is targets.  Again.  This time a pledge to build 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.  At 4.1GW, Berwick Bank makes up a huge chunk of that. SSE isn't saying yet that they can't be generating by 2030, even with this latest hold-up.  But it's leaving little room for manoeuvre. The energy giant is now pushing for a decision by the summer, well ahead of the next opportunity to bid for a government contract in 2025 BBC Scotland News understands SSE is now pushing the Scottish government for a decision to be made by early summer, having first lodged plans for the development in December 2022. A spokesperson said that a decision would let them begin ""unlocking the potential economic opportunities of offshore wind in Scotland."" SSE said approval would let it also grow ""the domestic supply chain"" and deliver against both Scottish and UK offshore wind targets. An estimated 4,650 jobs could be created if Berwick Bank goes ahead. UK energy minister Andrew Bowie told the Times newspaper any further delays would “put at risk the goal to get to net zero by 2050”. Six projects have been approved as part of the Innovation and Target Oil and Gas leasing round from Crown Estate Scotland. This includes the Green Volt development, which will consist of up to 35 turbines generating half a gigawatt of electricity. Any excess energy not consumed by offshore installations will be fed into the National Grid and it is hoped the project would be operational by 2029. First minister Humza Yousaf said the news showed Scotland ""is one of the best places in the world to develop offshore wind and its supply chain."" Aberdeen-based businessman Sir Ian Wood, who chairs the North Sea net zero transition firm ETZ, claimed the project ""sends a huge signal"" to investors that Scotland is a pioneer in offshore wind technologies."

The firm had prevented streaming services from informing users of payment options outside the Apple app store, the European Commission said. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple abused its dominant position in the market for a decade. She ordered the US tech giant to remove all the restrictions. Apple has said it will appeal against the decision. The European Commission's decision was triggered by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify, which was unhappy about the restriction and Apple's 30% fee.. Ms Vestager said Apple had restricted ""developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem"". ""This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" she said. However, Apple said it would appeal, adding there was no evidence consumers had been harmed. ""The decision was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,"" the company said in a statement. ""The primary advocate for this decision, and the biggest beneficiary, is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. ""Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the EC [European Commission] more than 65 times during this investigation,"" it said. Spotify called the fine handed out to Apple ""an important moment"" and said it sent ""a powerful message"" that ""no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers"". Apple said the Swedish company pays no commission to them as it sells its subscriptions on its website and not on the app store. Spotify had argued that the restrictions benefit Apple's rival music streaming service, Apple Music. In January, Apple announced plans to allow EU customers to download apps outside of their own app store, as the introduction of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) drew closer. The aim of the European Union's DMA is to help competition in the technology sector and to try to break down the stronghold the likes of Apple and Google have on the market. The tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with a full list of requirements under the new legislation, or face a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover. The firms have until later this week to comply with a raft of changes announced since the start of the year, as Apple, Meta and TikTok pursue challenges to aspects of the law. Law professor at EDHEC, Anne Witt, told the BBC the DMA will have a ""significant impact"" on the way designated platforms operate within the EU. ""It is a more effective but also much blunter legal tool in the fight against market concentration in the digital economy,"" she said. Last week, Spotify and 33 other companies operating across a wide range of digital sectors wrote to the European Commission with a renewed attack on Apple's ""lack of compliance"" with the DMA. ""Apple's new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,"" it said."

Paul Evans, 66, volunteers as an administrator and IT manager at Kingswood Heritage Museum in South Gloucestershire. The museum celebrates the town's diverse history and industries. ""It would be a sad and bare place if we ignored everything that has happened in the past,"" Mr Evans said. ""We take from the past to learn for the future."" With a team of 40 volunteers, it is the largest independent, volunteer-run museum in the county. The site, which is based in Warmley, has occupied the home of William Champion's former brass works since 1991. Dating back to the 18th Century, it is the building where Champion developed the first commercial production of zinc in Europe. ""Kingswood and the surrounding area has a really, really rich history, both socially and industrially,"" Mr Evans said. ""It's quite strange because there's a few myths around Kingswood,"" he added. Visitors at the museum can learn about some of the most famous myths. Mr Evans said one of the most well-known myths was that of the Kingswood Elephant. The circus elephant, which was said to be travelling with the circus in the late 1800s, died after eating some yew trees in the area. According to the myth, the elephant is buried in the town. A statue of the sea god Neptune stands in the grounds adjacent to the museum. It was built by William Champion in the 18th Century. Also known as the Warmley Giant, it is claimed to be the largest garden statue in Britain and the oldest concrete statue. ""It all forms part of the Champion story,"" Mr Evans said. The museum also features Roman artefacts from Stonehill, objects from Douglas Motorcycles and boot maker GB Brittons. Modern exhibitions showcasing more recent developments and changes to the town are also being created, focusing on the changing high street and new technological advancements. ""I would dearly love for the museum to still be there in 30 years' time,"" Mr Evans said. ""A lot of people visit and the phrase they tend to use is 'it's a hidden gem'. ""I just want people to come and see it and experience the fantastic heritage that is Kingswood and the surrounding area. ""It's important to keep that information and that link going,"" he added.

When Pa Edrissa Manjang began working for Uber Eats, in November 2019, its app did not regularly ask him to send selfies in order to register for jobs. But the Microsoft-powered Uber Eats app increased these verification checks. And in 2021, it said after ""careful consideration"" his account would be removed, due to ""continued mismatches"". An Uber representative said: ""Our real-time ID check is designed to help keep everyone who uses our app safe and includes robust human review to make sure that we're not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the App Drivers and Couriers Union funded Mr Manjang's case. The EHRC was concerned the artificial intelligence in the facial-recognition checks had deprived him of his income. The ADCU said the number of selfies Mr Manjang had been asked for amounted to racial harassment. The union told BBC News it was ""working hard"" to ensure workers' rights were protected as ""the pace of development of AI and machine-learning tools in the workplace accelerates"". Mr Manjang, who was reinstated and continues to work for Uber Eats, in Oxfordshire, said the out-of-court settlement marked the end of a ""long and difficult"" period for him. His case ""shines a spotlight"" on the potential problems with AI, particularly for ""low-paid workers in the gig economy"". And he hoped the decision would help strengthen ""rights and protections of workers in relation to AI, particularly ethnic minorities"". Baroness Falkner, who chairs the EHRC, said Mr Manjang should never have have had to sue Uber Eats to understand the opaque processes affecting his work. ""We are particularly concerned that Mr Manjang was not made aware that his account was in the process of deactivation, nor provided any clear and effective route to challenge the technology,"" she said.

Playful and provocative, Salvador Dalí's moustache was more than mere facial hair but a bold artistic statement. In an exclusive BBC interview the Surrealist artist shared the secret behind the most famous moustache in the world. In 1955, Spanish artist Salvador Dalí – who was born this week 120 years ago – sat down with veteran broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge on the BBC's Panorama, and spoke about the most potent symbol of his artistic identity – his moustache . Muggeridge conceded that he should really be asking the famed Surrealist about the bizarre dreamlike images that made his name, but the sight of Dalí's flamboyantly lustrous whiskers proved irresistible to him. What followed, for a BBC programme known for its investigative current affairs documentaries, was a fittingly surreal interview. ""The first question that I want to put to you – it really ought to be about modern art but I can't help it – there is some delicious frivolity in you that makes me ask it – how did you manage to produce those magnificent moustaches?"" said Muggeridge. ""In the beginning of this moustache, I used one very natural product,"" replied Dalí. ""Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently. ""But now I use one real product, very good, [found] in the Place Vendôme, Hungarian wax Pinaud [a French brand that has been going since 1810]. It's a very well-known wax already. Proust, Marcel Proust [the French novelist], uses the same."" ""Yes, but his was a little pointed one, wasn't it,"" replied Muggeridge, warming to the subject. ""It didn't have a splendid upturn like yours."" ""He used this wax but he used it in another manner or another mode in one depressing… way. A little depressing and melancholic. My moustache contrarily is very gay, very pointed, very aggressive."" More like this: Muggeridge ploughed on, pressing the artist for more details on his gravity-defying facial hair, discovering the artist cleaned it every evening – allowing it to become soft and droop down overnight – the time it took to get ready in the morning – a brisk three minutes – and how his moustache served as a practical tool for his ""inspiration"". Muggeridge was not alone in being captivated by the artist's exuberantly bold whiskers. Synonymous with the artist himself, Dalí's cartoonishly waxed moustache had become a thing of legend. Dalí had sported a hirsute upper lip since the 1930s, and initially it was a relatively modest affair based on a look popularised at the time by US actor Adolphe Menjou. But as the years progressed, the artist's  moustache, ""like the power of my imagination, continued to grow,"" as Dalí would later put it in a photo book dedicated to his facial hair in 1954. By the 1940s, he was growing and styling his whiskers to increasingly dramatic heights, their upturned ends reminiscent of another earlier Spanish painter, Diego Velázquez. Dalí's distinctive facial hair served as a bold statement of intent, embodying rebellion, creativity, irreverence, individuality and absurdity . ""I can think of few other artists who pursued fame and fortune as aggressively as Salvador Dalí. He actively turned himself into a brand, shamelessly promoting himself through any means necessary,"" said art historian David Dibosa in the documentary Art on the BBC in 2022. ""And as with any brand, to be truly successful, you need a logo that's instantly recognisable."" Whether curled into a figure eight, bedecked by flowers or tied in a bow, his moustache became as carefully crafted as his public image. Its exaggerated curves, like his paintings, confronted viewers with the absurd, challenging them to question convention and their own reality . It served to solidify his image in the public's mind, a dramatic visual cue for the eccentric, theatrical and irreverent spirit that defined Dalí's artistic persona . In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. He would, at times, use his moustache as a paintbrush, or feature it in paintings, including Self-Portrait with Fried Bacon , further blurring the boundary between art and life, serious and comedic, the real and surreal. And as artistic brands go it has proved remarkably durable. Its surreal silhouette has adorned everything from jewellery to coffee mugs, and was even painted on a Delta Air Lines 757 plane in 2010. The same year, a poll for Movember, an annual event for growing facial hair, found it to be the most famous moustache of all time . In a suitably surreal epilogue, which illustrates his playful motif's staying power, when Dalí's body was exhumed for a paternity test in 2017, almost three decades after his death in 1989, his whiskers were still entirely intact , looking like clock hands reading 10.10. ""I was eager to see him, and I was absolutely stunned,"" Narcis Bardalet, who had been in charge of embalming Dalí's body, told Spain's RAC1 radio station at the time. ""It was like a miracle... his moustache appeared at 10 past 10 exactly."" -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter , while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook , X and Instagram ."

The bank said this would give ""greater flexibility"" and was closer to what happens in other big financial centres such as Singapore and New York. Bonuses were limited to twice basic pay in a move introduced by the EU in 2014. Other big banks are thought to be considering a similar moves. The limit on bankers' bonuses was introduced by the EU in 2014 despite British opposition, to try to discourage the kind of excessive risk-taking that contributed to the 2008 great financial crisis. Critics argued that banks were able to get round it by simply increasing base salaries. This then made it harder to reduce salaries when bankers performed badly, or claw back pay if misconduct came to light. When it brought in the changes, the Financial Conduct Authority said the change should remove these ""unintended consequences"". The decision was first announced by Kwasi Kwarteng during his brief stint as chancellor in 2022, in a bid to boost the competitiveness of London as a financial centre. Banks have argued that the bonus cap makes it harder to attract talent from the US and Asia to the UK. Goldman Sachs said in a statement: ""This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent."" A number of other banks have reportedly been reviewing their pay policies in the light of the changes. When the decision to remove the bonus cap was announced last year, the Trades Union Congress general secretary Paul Nowak called it an ""insult to working people"" when ""millions up and down the country are struggling to make ends meet."" The change will not be universally welcomed by bankers, some of whom prefer to receive more of their income as guaranteed basic pay rather than bonuses which depend on their performance."

Changes to its system for suggesting content, particularly on Reels - its short-form video service - will prioritise original content and ""give all creators an equal chance of breaking through"". Experts say the Meta-owned platform is trying to copy what has driven the success of TikTok - as its potential ban in the US looms . But some in the creator community say the changes may come too late for users who have lost patience with Instagram's approach to its Reels feature. In a blog post , Instagram said it would  ""correct"" its previous approach to recommending content, which favoured accounts with larger followings and ""aggregators"" which repost lots of other creators' content. The changes will be rolled out over the next few months. Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at eMarketer, said it was clear what Instagram had in its sights. ""The battle for TikTok creators is on,"" she told the BBC. TikTok’s highly-personalised algorithm and For You Page of recommended content  has made it “the platform of choice” for smaller, emerging creators keen to break through, she said. Being so adept at promoting viral videos, regardless of who makes them, is what has helped make TikTok so popular worldwide - and is what Meta is seeking to copy, especially with its rival's future in doubt, in the US at least. ""Instagram wants to become the go-to platform for those creators if TikTok were to be banned,"" Ms Enberg explained. But this is not the first time Meta has tinkered with Instagram - and there is no guarantee it will work, for creators or audiences. Katy Cowan, who runs Creative Boom - a Manchester-based platform for design creatives - told the BBC this has been ""a kick in the teeth"" for smaller creators. She thinks the changes may come ""too late"" for those frustrated by frequent platform and algorithmic changes. ""I think people are just sick and tired of Instagram changing things,"" she said. ""I love Instagram and it's where I built my audience but the constant fluctuations in reach and stifled growth have made it not worth the investment in time,"" wrote film-maker Travis Meadors on Meta's app for text posts, Threads. Under the changes in coming months, ""aggregator"" accounts that repeatedly post content they did not create, or make material edits to, will not be included in areas of the app where they are recommended to users, such as in Explore or Reels feeds. Instagram will also ""reward"" original creators by replacing a duplicate of a video with its original in recommendations where it finds multiple versions. This will not apply to content which is remixed or edited to become a meme or parody, it says. It will also apply labels attributing original creators on reposted content. ""It takes a lot of time and effort to create original content, so those who create it should get credit and distribution even when it is reposted by other accounts,"" Instagram said. Meta is not the only social media firm revamping its offering in the face of TikTok's travails. Popular live-streaming platform Twitch - which is owned by Amazon - has also just rolled out its own TikTok-style short video feed to all users. The ""Discovery Feed"" on Twitch's mobile app will provide users with a personalised, scrollable blend of clips and live streams to ""help viewers find content to enjoy quickly and help streamers get discovered, even when they’re not live"". Whether these changes are what creators - and customers - actually want is less clear, says Kate Cowan. Many are now looking to other platforms such as LinkedIn for an audience. Some, she says, feel the key to reaching people in the future may even lie with approaches from the past, and a"" humble return to traditional marketing""  such as in-person events and meet-ups."

Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned. He also said he was confident allies of the Nato military alliance would agree a long-term funding deal for Ukraine by July. But he suggested Ukraine might have to decide on some ""kind of compromises"". Mr Stoltenberg was speaking to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday morning. On the Middle East conflict, he said it was ""very important"" that the US and other Nato countries conveyed ""a very clear message to Israel"" that they have to do ""significantly more"" to protect civilians and aid workers after the World Central Kitchen convoy attack . Mr Stoltenberg took over as the leader of Nato, the Western defence alliance, 10 years ago. Speaking to mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation, he told me the world was now ""much more dangerous, much more unpredictable"" and ""much more violent"". He said there is an ""authoritarian"" alliance giving each other practical support that is ""more and more aligned"". The Nato chief explained: ""China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing."" Russia was providing technology to Iran and North Korea in return for ammunition and military equipment, he added. Mr Stoltenberg told me that Nato had to work with other countries beyond its geography - such as Japan and South Korea - to ""stand up against this stronger alliance of authoritarian powers"". The Nato chief has been trying to persuade other countries to commit more money to the war effort in Ukraine in recent days in the hope of a five-year, 100bn euro (£86bn) fund. He said he was confident he would get an agreement by July, despite some countries expressing hesitation this week . Long-term support was vital now, and to rebuild the country after the conflict, he said. ""Even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future, we need to support Ukraine for many years, to build their defences to deter future aggression,"" he said. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. However, while Mr Stoltenberg said that military support was vital to repel Russian forces from Ukraine and force Putin to give up his goals of occupation, he also suggested that Ukraine might ultimately have to make concessions too. ""At the end of the day, it has to be Ukraine that decides what kind of compromises they're willing to do, we need to enable them to be in a position where they actually achieve an acceptable result around the negotiating table,"" he said. He said he was not calling for Ukraine to offer concessions now, and added that ""real peace"" would be achievable when ""Ukraine prevails"". But his language is notable because President Volodymyr Zelensky has always been adamant that he would never negotiate with Putin despite some calls on him to do so, including from the Pope. Mr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether he was concerned about the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, saying only that he was sure the US would continue to be an important ally, whoever was in charge. But his remarks about the way regimes around the world are working together are a reminder for Western leaders of the complicated and dangerous diplomatic jigsaw they have to piece together. More than two years into the conflict in Ukraine, our politicians must grapple with the reality that what is happening there is affected by decisions not just in Moscow and Kyiv but also in Washington DC, Brussels and London, as well as Beijing, Tehran and even Pyongyang. Meanwhile, six months into the Middle East conflict in Gaza, as Jeremy Bowen writes , solutions are affected by decisions not just by Israelis and Palestinians, but also Iranians, politicians in the US, the Gulf States and the UK. Most recently, this has centred on a row over arms sales, prompting criticism of the government from all sides. The latest intervention came on Saturday morning from one former Conservative prime minister , Boris Johnson, to another, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron. Foreign policy is rarely the overwhelming driver of votes and public opinion in the UK. This is partly because opposition parties traditionally try to avoid fights at home about battles abroad. It's also partly because voters' top priorities normally centre on their own lives and the prospects for their families. But that does not mean that the public doesn't care, or is immune from the horror they see unfolding on their screens every day, or hasn't been affected by world events - take, for instance, the huge energy price rises caused by the Ukraine conflict. And conflicts around the world in all their complexities are increasingly occupying our politicians' time, energy and effort."

The adult site is facing new obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), including strict requirements on age verification. The new rules apply to what the EU designates a Very large Online Platform (VLOP) - which Pornhub says it is not. ""We believe the European Commission erred in its calculation of our user numbers"", the firm said. The challenge was filed to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg on March 1 for Pornhub by its owner, the Canada-based Aylo. Technius, the parent firm of another adult site, Stripchat, has also registered a case, as has WebGroup Czech Republic, which operates XVideos. To be designated a VLOP, a site needs to be visited by more than 45 million Europeans on average every month - a threshold the EU says Pornhub meets. ""The Commission stands fully behind its calculations of the user numbers of Pornhub and Stripchat,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. But Aylo says as of January 31, 2024, Pornhub had 32 million monthly active users - so it is filing an application to have its VLOP status annulled. It said it looked forward to the facts ""being fully and fairly aired"" in court. The DSA aims to give people in the EU greater protections online, with VLOPs facing what the European Commission calls more ""diligent content moderation."" Among its measures are new responsibilities to take down illegal content, such as non-consensual videos. Sites can also be asked to have a publicly accessible database of advertisements - a requirement Aylo says it considers ""illegal"". The platforms are expected to give detailed plans by April 20 about how they limit major risks like violence against women and protection of minors. Breaching the new law can lead to fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover. The websites' owners had until this month to contest the decisions. The DSA is not only the piece of European legislation causing tech companies headaches. From Thursday, six big firms - designated ""gatekeepers"" by the EU - face new responsibilities under the Digitial Markets Act (DMA). But one of them, Apple, has already run into controversy. It has barred Fortnite-maker, Epic Games, from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe. One of the DMA's objectives is to open up big tech app stores to more competition. The EU says it will now question Apple about its decision."

Speaking to the BBC in Beijing, the US's top diplomat said he had made clear to his counterparts they were ""helping fuel the biggest threat"" to European security since the Cold War. He did not say what measures the US was prepared to take. But Mr Blinken was also keen to stress progress had been made in some areas. He praised Beijing for making efforts in stopping supplies of the drug fentanyl reaching the US. China remains the principal source of fentanyl for the US, which the White House has said is causing a public health crisis across the country. Mr Blinken also stressed he felt Beijing can play a ""constructive"" role in the Middle East, pointing towards China using ""its relationship with Iran to urge"" against further escalation in its confrontation with Israel. The visit - the second in 10 months made by Mr Blinken - forms part of a significant increase in dialogue and diplomacy between these rival powers as they attempt to put relations on an even keel after a period of immense tension last year. Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained by China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea, and US export bans on advanced tech. They were further damaged by a row over a spy balloon last February. In recent days, the US passed a law that would force Chinese-owned TikTok to sell the hugely popular video app or be banned in America - something Mr Blinken earlier revealed had not come up in his meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi - who met Mr Blinken on Friday afternoon in Beijing's Great Hall of the People - agreed the two sides had ""made some positive progress"" since he met his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November. He added the countries should ""be partners, not rivals"", saying that if the US took ""a positive view of China's development"", relations could ""truly stabilise, get better and move forward"". Mr Blinken told the BBC that one of the key routes for ""better relations"" between China and both the US and Europe would be for Beijing ""or some of its enterprises"" to stop providing ""critical components"" that help Russia make more munitions. The components include items such as ""machine tools, micro-electronics, and optics"". ""It's helping Russia perpetuate its aggression against Ukraine, but it's also creating a growing threat to Europe because of Russia's aggression,"" he explained, adding it was ""helping to fuel the biggest threat to [Europe's] insecurity since the end of the Cold War"". ""We've taken action already against Chinese entities that are engaged in this,"" he said. ""And what I make clear today is that if China won't act, we will."" Mr Blinken - who hinted at sanctions as a possible route - was keen to stress that China was not directly supplying Russia with weapons. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Blinken said it remained important to see if the two countries could ""build greater cooperation in areas where we have mutual interest"", including artificial intelligence and military communications."

After weeks of back and forth, the new songs get personal, with allegations of domestic violence and secret children. Drake's track, Family Matters, appears to suggest that one of Lamar's children was fathered by another man. Lamar's response, Meet The Grahams, alleges that Drake is addicted to gambling, sex, drugs and alcohol. Drake rejects the claims as a ""shambles"". The two songs, released within minutes of each other on Saturday morning, are much darker than earlier missives in their war of words. Drake, who is the most streamed rapper in the world, casually suggests that Lamar is a perpetrator of spousal abuse, rapping: "" They hired a crisis management team/To clean up the fact that you beat on your queen."" Outside of the song, Lamar has never been accused of any form of domestic violence. Drake also addresses the legal aftermath of his earlier diss track, Taylor Made Freestyle. The song, which used Artificial Intelligence to duplicate the voice of Tupac Shakur, was taken down after a complaint from Shakur's estate. In Family Matters, he accuses Lamar of pulling strings behind the scenes to force that outcome. "" You called the 2Pac Estate/And begged 'em to sue me and get that [expletive] down, "" he says. Lamar wasted no time in retaliating. His song, Meet The Grahams, arrived 20 minutes later, along with the warning: ""You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name"". The Compton-born rapper proceeded to call out Drake's parents, and his six-year-old son, by name. "" Dear Adonis, I'm sorry that that man is your father ,"" he raps in the opening bars. "" Let me be honest, it takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive. "" He later calls Drake a ""deadbeat"" and suggests he has secretly fathered another child. Drake responded to the latter accusation with an Instagram post, stating: ""Hold on, can someone find my hidden daughter and send her to me pls... These guys are in shambles"", accompanied by several laughing emojis. Elsewhere on Meet The Grahams, Lamar repeats allegations that Drake has used ghost writers instead of composing his own verses, and that he has undergone plastic surgery. Lamar also alleges that people on the payroll at Drake's record label OVO are ""sex offenders"". The lyric appears to be a reference to Canadian rapper Baka Not Nice, who began his career as a security guard for Drake, and who was charged in 2014 with forcing a 22-year-old woman into prostitution. The rapper, whose real name is Travis Savoury, pleaded guilty to assault , but the prostitution charges were dropped. Drake and Lamar's feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. During a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had ""tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes"". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop. The feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the ""big three"" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter. Lamar responded with a fiery verse on the song Like That, declaring that there was no ""big three - it's just big me"". Since then, both sides have released a number of diss tracks, with the tension continually ramping up. The fall-out has been good for business, however, with both sides scoring hits in this week's Top 40."

The Knepp Estate in Horsham, West Sussex - just 20 miles from Gatwick - has been hailed by David Attenborough as a pioneering rewilding project where wildlife now thrives. Composer Damian Montagu and Hazel Reeves, a field-recording artist and sculptor,  have created a piece called Knepp Dawn. Ms Reeves regularly records the sounds of nature in the park, which is home to nightingales, turtle doves, peregrine falcons, ravens, red kites and skylarks . In the early 2000s, the owners of Knepp, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, decided to rewild their land . Last year, Ms Tree told the BBC how they removed fences so animals could roam, allowed hawthorn, blackthorn, dog rose and brambles to take off and left oak saplings to regenerate. The release of Knepp Dawn on Saturday has been timed to highlight International Dawn Chorus Day on Sunday. The event, which is promoted by wildlife trusts on the first Sunday in May each year, sees people getting up early to listen to birdsong at daybreak and celebrate the natural phenomenon. Ms Tree said she was delighted Knepp's dawn chorus had inspired the musical tribute. She said: ""The human response to what we hear in nature is a celebration in itself and reminds us that we, too, are part of nature's tapestry."" Mr Montagu has said it was Ms Reeves's recordings of Knepp’s dawn chorus, including ""the very distinctive isolated sounds of nightingales, cuckoos, turtle doves, and white storks"" that compelled him to write the track. Ms Reeves, whose sculptures include Manchester's statue of Emmeline Pankhurst and the statue of railway engineer Sir Nigel Gresley at King's Cross, said Knepp showed ""how nature can bounce back"".

Mr Abbas, who runs parts of the occupied West Bank, said any attack could see Palestinians flee Gaza. Israel has consistently vowed to carry out an offensive in Rafah. US President Joe Biden ""reiterated his clear position"" on Rafah to Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a call on Sunday. The US has repeatedly said it cannot support a large-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah without seeing a credible plan to keep civilians out of harm's way. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Saudi capital Riyadh earlier, Mr Abbas - whose Palestinian Authority is not present in Gaza, which has been under Hamas rule since 2007 - urged the US to intervene. ""We appeal to the United States of America to ask Israel to stop the Rafah operation because America is the only country capable of preventing Israel from committing this crime,"" he said, adding that only a ""small strike"" on Rafah would force the Palestinian population to flee the Gaza strip. ""The biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history would then happen."" More than half of Gaza's population is in Rafah and conditions in the overcrowded southern city are already dire, with displaced people there telling the BBC there was a lack of food, water and medication. While the White House did not elaborate on what specifically Mr Biden's latest comments to Mr Netanyahu were regarding the planning offensive in Rafah, national security spokesman John Kirby told the ABC network that Israel had agreed to listen to US concerns and thoughts before going in. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Riyadh where he will hold talks with Mr Abbas at the start of a new Middle East tour. Meanwhile, the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a potential ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza, which have gained new momentum recently, have been further exposing divisions in Israel's governing coalition. War cabinet member and opposition figure Benny Gantz on Sunday said that the current government ""would not have the right to continue to exist"" if a reasonable deal to return the hostages was not accepted. ""Entering Rafah is important in the long struggle against Hamas. The return of our abductees, is urgent and of far greater importance,"" Mr Gantz wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, however, said the government should resign if it accepted a deal in which the planned offensive in Rafah was cancelled. Their comments come after Israel's foreign minister said that the country could suspend the incursion, which Mr Netanyahu has said is the next step in its battle against Hamas, if there was a hostage deal. The Israeli military said its chief Herzi Halevi had approved plans to continue the war, with Israeli media saying this referred to the Rafah operation. Long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar have largely stalled because of the gaps between the Israeli and Hamas positions, but on Sunday Hamas said it would send representatives to Cairo to give a response to the latest proposal. US media have quoted unnamed Egyptian officials as saying the latest ceasefire proposal given to Hamas involved a several-week period of calm intended to lead to the end of the war, in return for the release of 20 hostages. Hamas wants a permanent end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, while Israel insists Hamas must be destroyed in Gaza and all hostages freed. Egypt and other Arab states have previously said an influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war would be unacceptable because it would amount to the expulsion of Palestinians from their land. Satellite pictures have shown new tent encampments being built near the Gaza coast, to the west of Rafah and the city of Khan Younis slightly further north, which has been left largely in ruins. Media reports say the tents are to accommodate people displaced from Rafah. The current war began when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. Some 133 hostages are believed still to be in Gaza, of whom about 30 are thought to be dead, after a brief truce in November saw some hostages released. This week Hamas's armed wing released two videos showing the first proof of life of three hostages since they were abducted last October. Israel's campaign of aerial bombardment and ground operations in Gaza since 7 October has killed 34,454 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Over the six months of war, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have entered and taken control of all of northern Gaza including Gaza City and most of central and southern Gaza including Khan Younis. They have since withdrawn from almost all of those areas but troops remain stationed on a road Israel has built that separates northern and southern Gaza. However, Palestinians displaced to southern Gaza - where the Israeli military told them to go for their own safety earlier in the war - have been unable to return to homes further north, a key demand Hamas is making in ceasefire talks, and Israel has given no indication when they will be allowed to. Meanwhile, deadly Israeli bombardment has continued across Gaza, including in Rafah, with the Israeli military saying it has been striking launch sites for projectiles."

In the second 12 months on the front line - as Moscow pushed its so-called meat grinder strategy - we found the body count was nearly 25% higher than in the first year. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. New graves in cemeteries helped provide the names of many soldiers. Our teams also combed through open-source information from official reports, newspapers and social media. More than 27,300 Russian soldiers died in the second year of combat - according to our findings - a reflection of how territorial gains have come at a huge human cost. Russia has responded to the BBC's report saying only the defence ministry in Moscow can give this kind of information. The term meat grinder has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. The overall death toll - of more than 50,000 - is eight times higher than the only official public acknowledgement of fatality numbers ever given by Moscow in September 2022. The actual number of Russian deaths is likely to be much higher. Our analysis does not include the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk - in eastern Ukraine. If they were added, the death toll on the Russian side would be even higher. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was the ""exclusive prerogative of the Ministry of Defence"" to provide information on casualties, because of laws covering state secrets and disseminating information during the ""special military operation"", the phrase Russia uses for its war in Ukraine. Ukraine, meanwhile, rarely comments on the scale of its battlefield fatalities. In February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed - but estimates, based on US intelligence, suggest greater losses. The BBC and Mediazona's latest list of dead soldiers shows the stark human cost of Russia's changing front-line tactics. The graph below shows how the Russian military suffered a sharp spike in the number of deaths in January 2023, as it began a large-scale offensive in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. As Russians fought for the city of Vuhledar it used ""ineffective human-wave style frontal assaults"", according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). ""Challenging terrain, a lack of combat power, and failure to surprise Ukrainian forces"", it said, led to little gains and high combat losses. Another significant spike in the graph can be seen in spring 2023, during the battle for Bakhmut - when the mercenary group, Wagner, helped Russia capture the city. Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, estimated his group's losses around that time to be 22,000. Russia's capture of the eastern-Ukrainian city Avdiivka last autumn also led to another surge in military deaths. Counting graves Volunteers working with the BBC and Mediazona have been counting new military graves in 70 cemeteries across Russia since the war started. Graveyards have been expanded significantly, aerial images show. For example, these images of Bogorodskoye cemetery in Ryazan - to the south-east of Moscow - show a whole new section has appeared. Pictures and videos taken on the ground suggest most of these new graves belong to soldiers and officers killed in Ukraine. The BBC estimates at least two in five of Russia's dead fighters are people who had nothing to do with the country's military before the invasion. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia was able to use its professional troops to conduct complicated military operations - explains Samuel Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). But a lot of those experienced soldiers are now likely to be dead or wounded, says the defence analyst, and have been replaced by people with little training or military experience - such as volunteers, civilians and prisoners. These people can't do what professional soldiers can do, explains Mr Cranny-Evans. ""This means they have to do things that are a lot simpler tactically - which generally seems to be a forward assault onto Ukrainian positions with artillery support."" Prison recruits are crucial to the success of the meat grinder - and our analysis suggests they are now being killed quicker on the front line. Moscow allowed Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to begin recruiting in prisons from June 2022. The inmates-turned-fighters then fought as part of a private army on behalf of the Russian government. Wagner had a fearsome reputation for relentless fighting tactics and brutal internal discipline. Soldiers could be executed on the spot for retreating without orders. The group continued to recruit prisoners until February 2023, when its relationship with Moscow began to sour. Since then, Russia's defence ministry has continued the same policy. Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June last year - and tried to advance towards Moscow before agreeing to turn back. In August, he was killed in a plane crash . Our latest analysis focused on the names of 9,000 Russian prison inmates who we know were killed on the front line. For more than 1,000 of them, we confirmed their military contract start dates and when they were killed. We found that, under Wagner, those former prisoners had survived for an average of three months. However, as the graph above suggests, those recruited later by the defence ministry only lived for an average of two months. A tale of two soldiers: Can Ukraine actually win? Ukrainecast - Frontline fighters on the Russian threat and the prospects for peace Listen now on BBC Sounds The ministry has created army units commonly known as Storm platoons , made up almost entirely of convicts. Similarly to Wagner's prisoner units, these detachments are reportedly often treated as an expendable force thrown into battle. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" one regular soldier, who had fought alongside Storm members, told Reuters last year. Recently, Storm fighters were instrumental in the months-long battle to capture Avdiivka. The city fell to Russia eight weeks ago and represented the biggest strategic and symbolic battlefield victory for Putin since Bakhmut. Under Wagner, new prison fighters were given a fortnight of military training before heading to the battlefield. By contrast, we found some defence ministry recruits were killed on the front line in the first two weeks of their contracts. The BBC has spoken to families of prison recruits who died - and soldiers still alive - who told us the military training offered to prison recruits by the defence ministry is insufficient. One widow told us her husband had signed his ministry contract in prison on 8 April last year - and he was fighting on the front line three days later. ""I had been sure that there would be the few weeks of training they talk about. And that there'd be nothing to fear until at least the end of April."" She said she waited to hear from him - but found out that he had been killed on 21 April. Another mother says she only found out her husband had been taken from prison to the battlefield when she tried to contact him about the death of their son, who had also been fighting. The woman, who we are calling Alfiya, says her 25-year-old son Vadim - a father of twins - had never held a weapon before being mobilised. She says she couldn't tell her husband Alexander about their son's death because he had been ""taken away"" to fight. She only found out he had gone via a phone call from another inmate. Alexander grew up in Ukraine and had family there - says Alfiya - and he knew it was ""a lie"" that Russia had invaded Ukraine to fight fascism. When army recruiters first came to the prison ""he sent them to hell,"" she says. Some seven months after the death of her son, Alfiya was informed that Alexander had also been killed. When working for Wagner, prison inmates were typically contracted for six months. The fighters - if they survived - would then be given their freedom at the end. But, since last September, under the defence ministry, enlisted prisoners must fight until they die or the war is over - whichever comes first. The BBC has heard recent stories of prisoners asking relatives to help them buy proper uniforms and boots. There have also been reports of inmates being sent to fight without proper kit, medical supplies or even Kalashnikov guns. ""Many soldiers had rifles that were unsuitable for combat,"" writes Russian war supporter and blogger Vladimir Grubnik, on his Telegram channel. ""What a foot soldier should do on the front line without a first aid kit, a spade to dig in a trench and with a broken rifle is a big mystery!"" Grubnik - who is based in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine - claims when commanders found out that some guns were ""completely broken"" they said it was ""impossible"" for them to be replaced. ""The rifle was already assigned to the person, and the harsh military bureaucracy couldn't do anything about it."" Former prisoners have also described the high price paid by their comrades. ""If you sign up now, be ready to die, mate,"" says Sergei, in an online forum for Storm fighters and their relatives, where information is shared. He claims to be a former inmate who has been fighting in a Storm unit since October. Another forum member says he joined a Storm platoon of 100 soldiers five months ago and is now one of just 38 still alive. ""Every combat mission is like being born again."""

WhatsApp is banned in Iran and North Korea and has been intermittently blocked in Syria, Senegal and Guinea. And last month, China banned iPhone users from downloading the secure platform. Other countries, including Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, restrict features such as voice calls. But WhatsApp can see where its users truly are, thanks to their registered phone numbers. “We have a lot of anecdotal reports of people using WhatsApp and what we can do is look at some of the countries where we're seeing blocking and still see tens of millions of people connecting to WhatsApp,"" Mr Cathcart told BBC News. China ordered Apple to block Chinese iPhone users from downloading WhatsApp from the AppStore in April, a move Mr Cathcart calls ""unfortunate"" - although the country was never a major market for the app. ""That's a choice Apple has made,"" he said. ""There aren't alternatives. ""I mean, that is really a situation where they've put themselves in the position to be able to truly stop something."" Android users, however, can still download WhatsApp without going through official shops. But elsewhere Mr Cathcart said the rise of virtual private networks (VPNs) and WhatsApp's proxy service, launched last June, has helped keep WhatsApp accessible. As well as WhatsApp and Signal - both end-to-end encrypted, so only the sender and receiver can read content - China has banned Telegram and demanded the removal of microblogging app Threads. Mr Cathcart was speaking to the BBC on the last day of the World Service Presents event about internet freedom. He has long considered the successful export of Western technology platforms key to spreading values of liberal democracy. But he admits its power is diminishing, along with the Western ideals of a free and open internet. ""It's certainly under threat - and I think it's a struggle,"" Mr Cathcart told BBC News. ""We take a lot of pride in the fact that we're providing secure private communication that is free from surveillance of authoritarian governments, or even censorship from government, to people all around the world who otherwise wouldn't have it. ""But it is a constant threat and a constant battle."" With its potential ban of Chinese-owned TikTok, for national security reasons, the US has now joined this battle. And Mr Cathcart was also keen to express concerns about continuing government moves, including in the UK, to ban end-to-end encryption and allow police to read suspected criminals' messages. ""Sadly, I don't think the debate is over,"" he told BBC News. ""People care about privacy, whether they're aware of end-to-end encryption and what it is and how it works. ""And that's one of the reasons we've had to communicate so much about it, is to be really clear about what it means and what's at stake."" Correction 2 May 2024: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated WhatsApp was currently banned in Syria, which is what the company had told BBC News. WhatsApp has now told BBC News this is not currently the case – although, the app has been intermittently blocked in the country – so the story has been amended."

The star cut several songs and re-structured the concert to showcase music from her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department. Fan favourites including The Archer and The 1 were dropped in favour of new songs like Fortnight and Down Bad. The star also debuted several new outfits, including a sparkling red bodysuit for the opening portion of the show, and a black dress with silver tassles during the Fearless era. Swift took to the stage at La Défense Arena in Paris shortly after 8pm local time, playing Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince, before greeting the sold-out crowd with a coquettish ""enchanté"". She added that she felt ""incredibly lucky"" to be launching the European leg of her tour in ""the most beautiful, romantic city in the world"". The 34-year-old remained on stage for more than three hours, finishing just after 11pm, having played 46 songs from across her 18-year career. The tour is themed around the different ""eras"" she's created in that time, with individual sets dedicated to each of her 11 studio albums. It kicked off in America last year, with fans boosting local economies and causing seismic activity with their dancing. The Paris concert was Swift's first since releasing The Tortured Poets Department, a 31-track double album, three weeks ago. Despite lukewarm reviews, it broke several sales records in its first week on sale. To make room for the new material, condensed the sister albums Folklore and Evermore  (both recorded during the Covid pandemic) into a single ""Folkmore"" chapter. Songs cut from the setlist: New songs added: Surprise songs / acoustic set Fans spotted changes to the lavish stadium show almost immediately after it began, with the intro music updated to include snippets of music from The Tortured Poets Department. But the first real confirmation came when The Archer was cut, 15 minutes into the concert. It was traditionally the sixth song on the setlist on previous legs. Then Swift pulled another surprise - moving the sequence concentrating on her Red album to an earlier part of the show. During those songs, the star wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the statement: ""This is not Taylor's version"" - a reference to the ongoing campaign to re-record her first six albums.  Swift performed the Tortured Poets Department material in a billowing cream ball gown, while the on-stage visuals adopted new a black-and-white theme. For the downbeat ballad Down Bad, she appeared in the  tractor beam of a UFO - a reference to the song's opening lyric: ""Did you really beam me up / In a cloud of sparkling dust / Just to do experiments on?"" The new music largely deals with the breakdown of two relationships - with British actor Joe Alwyn and The 1975's lead singer, Matty Healy. On stage, Swift jokingly described this portion of the show as ""female rage, the musical"". The final portion of the show - concentrating on the diaphanous pop of 2022's Midnights album - was unchanged, with Swift ending on the hit single Karma. The pop superstar's tour has become a cultural phenomenon, on a scale not seen since Madonna and Michael Jackson's concerts in the 1980s. She is playing 152 stadium dates, with dates booked until December 2024. When she wraps up, ticket sales are projected to reach $1.4 billion (£1.1 billion) - making it the most profitable tour of all time, surpassing the $939 million (£750 million) Elton John made on his multiyear farewell tour. The tour comes to the UK on 7 June, with dates in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London."

Albini was an instrumental and uncompromising figure in the US indie scene in the 1980s and 90s, leading bands including Big Black and Shellac. His influence was also heard on the several thousand albums he produced and engineered. They included the Pixies' seminal LP Surfer Rosa and Nirvana's In Utero. Kurt Cobain recruited Albini to record the 1993 follow-up to Nirvana's hugely successful Nevermind after being impressed by his work with Big Black, the Pixies and The Breeders. However, Albini was originally no fan of Nirvana, believing them to be an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound. He reportedly agreed to work with them because he felt sorry for them, believing they were at the mercy of their major record label, and wanted to give them a more abrasive sound. The album's resulting raw feel did not impress the Geffen label, which insisted the singles Heart-Shaped Box and All Apologies were remixed. In Utero went on to sell five million copies in the US alone, and Albini remarked: ""I like it far more than I thought I was going to."" In general, he disliked the title of producer, telling the Guardian last year he preferred to be credited as an engineer because he saw his role as recording a band and not shaping its sound. He also declined to take royalties, charging only a flat fee because he considered it unethical to make money from an artist's work indefinitely. He ran his own studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago, and had been preparing for the release of Shellac's To All Trains, their first album since 2014, on 17 May."

The foreign secretary acknowledged that the ""war will be lost if the allies don't step up"" on the BBC's Ukrainecast podcast. But asked whether Western nations should send troops into Ukraine, Lord Cameron replied ""no"". He added Nato must be in the ""best possible shape"" by the US elections. Lord Cameron was speaking at a two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) summit of 32 foreign ministers in Brussels. Nato boss Jens Stoltenberg has floated plans for a 100 billion euro (£86bn), five-year package of military aid to Ukraine, with the aim of finalising a package in time for the next summit in Washington in July. The move is aimed at allaying concerns around the outcome of the US election in November, with candidate Donald Trump suggesting the US could cut support , and claiming some Nato members were not paying their way. One diplomat, quoted by the Reuters news agency, suggested the package ""goes some way to protecting in case of Trump. But it is impossible to create something Trump-proof"". Lord Cameron said he'd be making his second visit to the United States since becoming foreign secretary next week and would be urging Congress to give more financial support, which ""could change the narrative"" in Ukraine. Nato would have to work with whoever wins this year's US election, he said, so now was the time to get into ""the best possible shape by November"" - alluding to complaints from candidate Mr Trump. He told Ukrainecast: ""If we can get that money out of the US Congress, if we can get Ukraine the arms they need, if we can show Putin that he can't outwait us and that Ukraine is going to fight back and win back more of its territory. ""If we can do all those things, whoever gets in in November, we'll look at the situation in Ukraine and... look at more and more Nato members spending 2% of their GDP on defence and say, this is a success story. I want to invest in this success. ""So turn Ukraine in the situation and Nato into the strongest possible alliance with the strongest possible prospect of success. And whoever wins in November 2024 would inherit a better situation."" The UK is a founding member of Nato, formed 75 years ago by countries including the US, Canada and France in order to block expansion by the Soviet Union - a group of communist states which included Russia. Some Nato members have sent weapons to Ukraine, with the UK, US, Germany and Turkey providing anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones. The US and UK have also supplied long-range missiles. Nato countries have not sent troops to Ukraine, and ruled out using their air forces to impose a no-fly zone over the country, because of fears such action could provoke a direct conflict with Russia. But the Russian invasion has rebooted conscription, particularly among countries living on Russia's doorstep . Asked about fears the war could still spill over the Ukrainian border, particularly in Poland and the Baltics, Lord Cameron gave assurances that Nato would intervene in those circumstances, under the organisation's Article 5 pledge that ""an attack on one is an attack on all"". But he ruled out Western ""boots on the ground"" in Ukraine itself, saying: ""We don't want to give Putin a target like that."" The former prime minister said the UK would use the ""architecture of Nato"" to deliver support to Ukraine but drew a distinction between a Nato mission ""for Ukraine"" as opposed to ""in Ukraine"". He added: ""I think it's not escalatory to say we're going to help this independent, sovereign country to fight off an aggressor and we're going to give it all the help we can  in order to do that."" Britain has given Ukraine more than £7bn and trained more than 60,000 Ukrainian soldiers, in a programme started under Mr Cameron's tenure as PM. But the foreign secretary urged other countries backing Ukraine to also step up, perhaps by donating weapons. ""Some weapons have an expiration date,"" he said. ""Much better to give those to Ukraine and they can use them than have to decommission them at home that actually costs you money."" Ukrainecast host Lucy Hockings tried to ask the foreign secretary about his views on the Israel-Gaza conflict but he declined to comment, saying he wanted to focus on Ukraine."

Social media use also rose in the age group over last year with nearly two in five using messaging service WhatsApp, despite its minimum age of 13. The communications regulator warned parental enforcement of rules ""appeared to be diminishing."" It also said the figures should be a ""wake up call"" for the industry to do more to protect children. In its annual study of children's relationship with the media and online worlds, Ofcom said the percentage of children aged between five and seven who used messaging services had risen from 59% to 65%. The number on social media went up from 30% to 38%, while for livestreams it increased from 39% to 50%. Just over 40% are reported to be gaming online - up from 34% the year before. Over half of children under 13 used social media, contrary to most of the big platforms' rules, and many admitted to lying to gain access to new apps and services. ""I think this is a wake up call for industry. They have to take account of the users they have, not the users that their terms and conditions say they have,"" Mark Bunting, from Ofcom's Online Safety Group told BBC News. ""We've known for a long time that children, under the age limit on a lot of the most popular apps, are widely using those apps, and companies are now under a legal obligation to take steps to keep those children safe,"" he added. Some campaigners want age limits to be introduced for smartphone use, and existing ones raised for social media. However it is already the case that most phones possessed by children are likely to have been provided by parents - under-18's cannot sign contracts, and most big operators say they do not sell pay-as-you-go phones to under-16's. Many parents give children phones because they want to be able to contact them or to track them via their mobile. How can you keep children safe online? Parents who spoke to the BBC also cited peer pressure, saying it was a struggle to keep children off social media when all their friends were a using an app. One parent said she felt ""pushed into a corner"". Heather Bryson who is 11 won wide recognition for her online exercise videos designed to help people in care homes during the pandemic, particularly those suffering dementia. She's had a smartphone since she was eight-years-old. Her parents feel she's benefited socially from being online, but what she does and who she communicates with are closely supervised. ""I think it's become an important tool for anyone growing up these days"", her father, Gary Bryson says. ""Being able to monitor exactly what she's doing is paramount"". Heather says it lets her talk with friends on social media and through message apps, but there are negatives. ""Sometimes I get boys swearing at me online in chats which is not nice, but the good things there are loads of nice people out there too"". ""It's just something that you get used to after a while but you shouldn't have to"", she says. Only a third of parents know the correct minimum age requirement for most social media platforms Ofcom suggests But the regulator said parents were also less willing to enforce the rules they knew about. Three in ten parents were willing to let a child aged 5-7 have a social media profile even if it was under the minimum age permitted for the apps, an increase compared to last year. Parents may be ""resigned"" to not being able to control children's online lives the new report notes. Mr Bunting said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for parents on this issue: ""It may not be about preventing use entirely for children under 13, which I think is very difficult in today's society. But parents can talk to their children about using those services safely. And we'd encourage them to do that,"" he said. Some say investigations like that carried out by the BBC this month - which found that children as young as nine were added to a malicious WhatsApp group - mean further action is needed. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has previously suggested that he favours requiring app-stores to check the ages of users. Responding to the Ofcom report, Clare Fernyhough, of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, told the BBC that society had sleep-walked into ""just assuming that we all need a smartphone - and now we're beginning to see the huge impact that that's having"" But Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre, said it was wrong to protect children by restricting their access to technology. ""This is the first generation with access to a powerful personal computer, it could be so amazing for them, and that's what children want too,"" she told the BBC. ""But the companies are risky by design, and what we need is child rights by design"", she said. Ofcom said new age limits for smartphones would be a matter for government. In May it will be consulting on the steps it expects tech firms to take to ensure children have safer experiences online, and later on new uses of AI to combat harmful content online. In a statement, the Secretary of State for Science, Technology and Innovation Michelle Donelan said protecting children online was the government's number one priority. ""Children as young as five should not be accessing social media and these stark findings show why our Online Safety Act is essential,"" she said. Does your young child have a smartphone?

business,politics,Neutral,"['the US House of Representatives', 'Kostyantynivka', 'Maxym', 'Maxym', 'the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies']",Ukraine aid package could help Kyiv slow Russia’s advance,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68868399,2024-04-21,0.14214973751491877,Normal,False,Soil contamination,"President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his gratitude to the US House of Representatives for approving a new $61bn (£49bn) package of military assistance for Ukraine after months of delays. He said the aid could save thousands of lives. While it's not uncommon for a country's future to be decided by politicians, a nation's very existence hinging on a vote 5,000 miles away is as extraordinary as it sounds. For Ukraine, the six-month wait for this military package has been as costly as it has been frustrating. Dwindling ammunition has cost it lives and territory . In this period of rare boosts for Kyiv, this was a biggie - the arrival of American weaponry will allow its beleaguered troops to do more than hang on. But it's no silver bullet. So, what is the package going to do? It is likely to include air defence systems, mid to long-range missiles and artillery shells. Ukraine's recent lack of them has led to Russian forces capturing hundreds more square kilometres of territory. When the aid arrives, Ukraine can potentially challenge Russia's air superiority, frustrate their supply lines and slow advancing troops. For Vitaliy, a serving soldier who we bump into in central Kyiv, it's important to focus on the positives. ""Every cent matters,"" he says. ""It is very much needed. We need everything. Every cartridge, every cent, every positive thought. We need all of it."" When I was in the Donetsk region last month , soldiers said most of the artillery rumbles were coming from the Russian side. Cities like Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk were bracing for what might be coming. This aid might save those cities. It won't give Ukraine the instant means to start liberating territory and force Russia back - but it gives a window for that to happen in the future. The consensus in Kyiv and Washington is that without this American help, Ukraine would lose. On a miserable Sunday morning, the warmth of the Kyiv metro will always beat the wet streets above. It's where we meet Maxym, who's pleased with the US aid finally being approved. ""I'm really happy about it,"" he says. ""I'm just a bit disappointed it took so long. Anyways, it's better late than never."" Maxym is frustrated by the growing debate over whether Ukraine should negotiate peace with Russia at the expense of territory. ""Russia doesn't want to negotiate,"" he explains. ""They don't want this middle ground that Europe and the US think will end this war. They want it all."" We also meet a woman, Vita, holding her son's hand and pulling him off a train. ""How else can Ukraine survive without it?"" she asks. ""It can't. We don't have such an army and weapons."" She then becomes emotional. ""It's impossible. We really want help, for our children to survive, so we wait."" She nods towards her son. The past six months have not only revealed Russia's dominance, but Europe's inability to provide the same level of support as the US. ""We need to think about the hypothetical eventuality the next package of US aid might not pass,"" says Mykola Bieleskov, a research fellow at the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies. ""That's why it's up for the UK and continental Europe to increase weapon production to meet Ukraine's requirements."" As for a realistic goal this year for Kyiv, Mykola hopes this American aid will help stabilise the front lines. Despite the return of western unity behind it, the issue for Ukraine has always been the time it takes for help to arrive. Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly doesn't have to negotiate as many political hurdles when it comes to military spending. Democratic delays aren't exclusive to allies overseas - Ukraine has its own issues with mobilising enough men for its war effort. A controversial conscription law has just been passed after months of debating and amendments. The challenge for President Zelensky now is keeping the politics separate to the fighting. He'll be under pressure to make this latest American offering count. Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Thanyarat Doksone"

The pop group were set to perform five shows on consecutive nights at the new £365m Co-op Live Arena from Tuesday. However, on Thursday, the gigs were moved to the AO Arena after the Co-op said it was unable to open due to technical issues around its ventilation system. Some Take That fans have seen their front row seats for Co-op Live changed to other blocks at the AO Arena. Ticketing provider Ticketmaster said it worked with the event promoter to ""move fans to a location as similar to their original booking as possible"", adding that ""some seating locations will vary"". Denise Taylor, 48, who has followed Take That since she was 15, said the experience had been ""one nightmare after another"" for the 7 May show. After spending £250 on a VIP ticket for second row floor seats, she has been moved to block 103, row C, which is a tier on the side of the AO Arena. ""I'm angry, I'm disappointed. I've been a fan since 1992 and I've never missed a tour. I used to watch them in nightclubs before they got famous,"" said Ms Taylor, from Stoke-on-Trent. She said she had bought the tickets as part of a presale promotion when she pre-ordered the band's upcoming album This Life. Ms Taylor, who will be going to the show with a friend, added she ""can't get excited"" for the concert anymore. Anita Morrissey-Booth, 43, from Manchester, said she had paid £250 for a seat in block A, row 2, in front of the stage, for the show on Tuesday but her seat had been moved ""38 rows back"". The self-described ""massive fan"" said: ""This is what I save up for, this is what I work hard for, to get these good tickets and see them everywhere."" Susie Hawcock, 52, from Doncaster, who is due at the Tuesday concert with husband Simon, 48, said she has been moved to the ""back of the arena"" after previously securing seats on a tier to the side. She said: ""It's ruined our couple of days."" All of the band's shows have been transferred to the AO Arena and are on the same dates as before except for 8 May which has been changed to 9 May. A Ticketmaster spokesperson said: ""We appreciate fans' understanding, and reiterate that refunds are available through their Ticketmaster account. Everyone who booked VIP floor seats remains in VIP floor seats after the relocation."" AO Arena general manager Jen Mitchell said the company ""completely sympathised"" with fans and that ticketing providers were ""working hard"". ""As a venue we don't manage ticketing,"" she said. On Saturday, Gary Simpson, senior vice president of operations UK at ASM Global, which runs AO Arena, said the week had been ""fantastic but hectic"". ""We’ve got a great team here at the AO Arena; 48 hours notice we’ve managed to put this show on tonight, we’ve got another five shows here next week of Take That as well, the team have been absolutely phenomenal,"" he added. Co-op Live said it was aware its actions had ""frustrated"" and ""angered"" ticket holders, adding it does not expect any further impact on its opening season.

Steel barriers line the streets. Students pack up belongings in their cars and leave for home - classes are cancelled, and exam plans are up in the air. Everywhere there is gloom, and uncertainty about what happens next at Columbia University in New York City. Students told the BBC that the university's decision to call in police to clear a Gaza protest late on Tuesday, leading to a raid on the occupied Hamilton Hall and more than 100 arrests, has left the college community shattered. The university president, Minouche Shafik, said that it was with great regret that she had ordered the police raid against students and others she said had infiltrated the protest. It would ""take time to heal"", she added in a message in the operation's aftermath. For students of this prestigious school in Manhattan, how long is unclear. ""It definitely feels like things are scattered,"" said Anna Oakes, a graduate journalism student at Columbia University who covered the removal of protesters from Hamilton Hall on Tuesday evening. ""There's this feeling of scramble in the aftermath."" After a night of chaos and confrontation, the clearest reminder of the protests on Wednesday morning was water-logged flyers littering streets alongside the campus perimeter. One said that protest organisers ""will not stop. We will not rest"". Students who remained said they were in the dark about plans for their finals and even whether dining services would be brought back fully. While others speed off in cars packed with possessions, Will Parkinson, a 20-year-old environmental studies student, described his feeling: ""Weird limbo."" ""We're not sure what to do,"" he said, and recounted how he watched from a friend's dorm window as police stormed Hamilton Hall. He had been barred from leaving the building during the raid, which meant he was unable to get home and finish a term paper. Mr Parkinson said Columbia had given students money to spend at nearby restaurants because they had to limit staff who would normally operate the university's cafeterias. He had left campus to eat, and was not sure when he would eventually write that paper. Others continued to peacefully protest, walking near the new steel barriers, holding slogans including ""Cops off campus"" and ""Student power v Israel power"". Members of the faculty, whose access to campus and offices is now largely denied, said they did not know how they were expected to conclude the semester. ""I have students who can't get to their work study to pay for school, I have faculty members with papers they need to grade locked in their offices, I have 16 instructors looking to me for guidance on how to support students through finals and the end of the semester,"" said Joseph Howley, a classics professor who has worked with the student protesters. ""So it has completely upended everything we do."" Unable to address those academic obligations, Prof Howley led dozens of students and faculty members in a protest outside the one campus entrance left unobstructed on Wednesday afternoon. He and others said that the university administration had lost their trust by bringing police on to campus, and that they shouted ""shame"" in unison when Dr Shafik's name was mentioned. One unidentified speaker at the protest said she was at Hamilton Hall when police ""ambushed us. We were tackled and beaten, and my hands were handcuffed so tightly that even lifting my pinky caused extreme harm and excruciating pain"". The NYPD denied that it was unnecessarily aggressive, and the administration has defended its decision to bring in police - who will remain on campus until 17 May. Meghnad Bose, a 31-year-old journalism graduate student at Columbia University, witnessed the NYPD raid on Tuesday night and said police acted ""rough and aggressive"" with the protesters. While 109 people at Columbia University were arrested when police stormed the school to quash the pro-Palestinian protest, police said at a Wednesday press conference that they arrested another 173 people at a similar sit-in at the City College of New York later in the evening. Police Commissioner Edward Caban said officers intervened because ""public safety was a real concern... the NYPD was called in to do their job"". A 19-year-old physics student named Kevin - he declined to give his last name - said it was ""difficult to be proud of being a Columbia student"" after the police raid, which had left him deeply frustrated. He spoke while piling bags full of clothes into his parents' car just outside the campus gates, and said he was unsure when he would return. ""It depends on what the university does in the coming months,"" he said. ""We'll see what they [the administration] say about it. The ball is in their court.""

Apple has a unique position as a tech brand. I've sat through a lot of Apple events in my time, both virtually and in person, and one thing that always makes us journalists raise an eyebrow is the whooping and cheering from the audience every time a new feature, no matter how small or incremental, is announced. When a new hardware product goes on sale, Apple employees form a guard of honour outside stores and applaud its first buyers - some of whom will have camped outside for hours in advance, and spent thousands of dollars (who else could get away with charging $3,500/£3,499, for a VR headset?). People get tattoos of Apple's distinctive fruit logo. ""Apple is like a strange drug that you just can't quite get enough of,"" wrote Leander Kahney in his 2006 book The Cult of Mac. It is this ""strange drug"" or ""magical experience"", as Apple put it in a statement on Thursday, which is now under fire. So far, Apple's ethos is a wildly successful business model. As I write, the firm is worth $2.6 trillion. Analysis firm CCS Insight estimates that 72% of smartphone handsets bought in North America alone in the last three months of 2023 were iPhones. Samsung took 25%, leaving just 3% for everybody else in the handset business. One of Apple's big selling points is its focus on privacy and security. But the question is whether it achieves this by shutting out the competition. The tech giant has engineered an illegal monopoly in smartphones, according to the sweeping US Department of Justice lawsuit filed on Thursday. Apple routinely blocks web trackers - an irritation for web users but also an important revenue generator for other digital businesses. It also operates a ""walled garden"". This means all Apple products work seamlessly together, and every app, payment method and operating system update is vetted and approved by the tech giant. It is, effectively, a closed ecosystem and that keeps it secure. Developers fume that they have to pay to get in, and also have to follow Apple's strict rules: but Apple says in return they get access to an enormous marketplace of potential customers. The music streaming platform, Spotify, and Epic Games, which makes Fortnite, are the two biggest commercial names to make a vocal stand against this. Fortnite was removed from the App Store: Spotify hasn't gone as far, perhaps because it has millions of iPhone-based subscribers. Apple's biggest smartphone rival is Google's Android, which is a far more sprawling affair. Its operating system has to work across dozens of different devices made by various manufacturers over the years. As a result, it offers more consumer choice - and is inevitably also less secure. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is not the only authority deciding to take a closer look at Apple's unique position. On two occasions now the tech giant has very reluctantly prised open its gates - and both times were caused by the European Union. It was recently forced to open up to other app stores in Europe. It did so very hesitantly, with plenty of warnings about the evil lurking outside of its own digital paradise. Until recently the iPhone didn't even use the same charging cable as almost everything else - most models require a bespoke lightning cable. But the EU is bringing in a common charger rule, and Apple is now selling lightning cable adaptors, as well as changing its most recent model to far more ubiquitous USB-C port. The DOJ doesn't have the same power, however. This will be a court process in which it will have to convince a judge, and it doesn't have a very successful track record of doing that. ""The last time a US court found a Big Tech company guilty of monopolisation dates back to 2001 (Microsoft),"" notes Anne Witt, Professor of Law at EDHEC business school in France. That was about the dominance of Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer, which was installed by default in millions of machines running Windows. It's worth remembering, however, that Apple is not holding its customers hostage, forcing them into its embrace. ""Every case against Apple portrays its users as consumers with no free will. I really struggle with that,"" remarked Carolina Milanesi from tech industry analysis firm, Creative Strategies. I know I have friends with iPhones who have dismissed the ""faff"" of changing to another brand, even if they like the look of something different. But that doesn't mean that Apple is actively stopping them - although a throw-away comment once made by CEO Tim Cook has now come back to bite him. A reporter in an interview mentioned that he was unable to share a video with his mum, who had a different phone. ""Buy your mom an iPhone,"" the Apple CEO joked. Apple has vowed to ""vigorously"" fight the lawsuit and denies the claims."

Ahead of the Eurovision final on Saturday, he looked at what bookmakers were saying about his chances of winning the contest. ""My odds for winning are at one per cent,"" laughs the singer. ""But that’s fine. It’s better than zero."" The former Years and Years singer is representing the UK this year with Dizzy, a throbbing slice of Pet Shop Boys-influenced pop. He is, by far, the biggest star we've sent to the contest in years: a Bafta-nominated actor with two number one albums, and collaborations with Elton John and Kylie Minogue under his belt. Eurovision host Graham Norton says that experience gives him an added advantage. ""Olly has already done all the things that it’s impossible to prepare someone for,"" he said earlier this week. ""He has played to huge crowds, he can relate to the cameras, and he is used to high pressure situations. Add to that, the fact that the song is a massive bop and I think we could do really well this year."" Proof came during rehearsals in Sweden last week. Alexander's confident (and acrobatic) performance wowed fans and the UK rose up the bookmakers' odds, briefly appearing in the top 10. At the time of writing, Alexander has slipped down again, after a technical malfunction affected his performance at Tuesday's semi-finals. ""I did have a slight wardrobe malfunction, in that my mic pack fell off in the second chorus,"" the star confirmed to BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills. ""So I was confused and stressed by that.” But overall, he's pleased with how the performance went. ""The thing about being here in Malmö, at the arena, is there's a lot of rehearsal,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's just like a military operation. So to do it properly, in front of the cameras, with an audience, was fun. The atmosphere ramps up."" Alexander's staging has become a talking point at this year's contest - quite a feat when he's competing against Ireland's ""gremlin witch"" Bambie Thug and Finland's mulleted and trouserless Windows95Man. His performs Dizzy inside a mocked-up gymnasium shower room, surrounded by four male dancers in red boxing gear. As the song plays out, the room appears to spin, with Alexander appearing to bounce off the walls and perform dance moves on the ceiling. It's all achieved with a combination of camera trickery and strong core muscles, he reveals. ""There are bars built into the sides of the walls,"" he says. ""Sometimes a dancer will grab one and turn themselves upside down, so that their feet are on the ceiling – but when the camera flips it looks like they’re still on the floor. ""I didn’t make things easy for myself,"" he adds. ""But on my last tour, I did a couple of songs on a treadmill. So I'm used to having a challenge."" Alexander has been a Eurovision fan since he was a child. His first memory of the contest was watching Gina G represent the UK with Ooh Ahh... Just A Little Bit in 1996 (she finished eighth). But he had never been to the contest, let alone participated, and the scale of it took him by surprise. ""I didn't realise how long the Eurovision season is. You go all around Europe and perform. Lots of countries have pre-parties and there’s a huge community that are waiting each year to see who the contestants are. ""And one thing I maybe forgot was that it's a competition. People are there to judge you. I'm used to being judged but it is so palpable [here]. People are [scrutinising] every little detail. That's quite intense to experience."" That scrutiny has only intensified this year over Israel's participation in the contest. Pro-Palestinian groups, as well as some musicians and Eurovision fans, have been calling for the country to be suspended due to the ongoing war in Gaza. In January, more than one thousand Swedish artists, including Robyn and Fever Ray, signed a letter asking for Israel's act, Eden Golan, to be excluded. A month later, another open letter signed by 400 people from the entertainment industry - such as Dame Helen Mirren and Boy George - supported Israel's participation.  Before being chosen as the UK’s entry, Alexander had also signed an open letter from an LGBTQ+ activist group calling for a ceasefire and describing Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocide”. In February, another pressure group called Queers for Palestine launched a petition calling for Alexander to boycott the contest. He responded in a joint statement with other Eurovision contestants, including Ireland's Bambie Thug and Danish entrant Saba, saying he supported a ceasefire, but would remain in the competition ""to come together and call for peace"". In a BBC documentary following his progress at Eurovision, he acknowledged how intense the conversation had become. ""A lot of the contestants and myself have been having a lot of comments that are like 'You are complicit in a genocide by taking part in Eurovision' which is quite extreme,"" he said. ""It's very extreme. ""I understand where that sentiment is coming from but I think it's not correct. ""It's an incredibly complicated political situation, one that I'm not qualified to speak on."" After the documentary was broadcast last week, he has decided to say no more about the issue. Speaking in Malmö, he confirms he has also ""deleted all my social media apps on my phone"" to avoid personal comments and focus on Saturday's grand final. But despite his years (and years) of experience, performing to a TV audience of 160 million people still gives him the jitters. ""To be honest, I haven’t been sleeping great because my brain just won't stop going,"" he says. ""But I'm feeling pretty good. I’ve been quite well-behaved!"" His odds of winning are still around one per cent, but having a guaranteed career outside Eurovision relieves some of the pressure. ""I've tried to just embrace the madness of the whole process, really,"" he says. ""It's teaching me a lot about fame and celebrity. I would never have experienced anything like this if I hadn't entered."" And what if he ends up at the bottom of the results table, like Mae Muller last year? ""I thought Mae Muller, even though she didn’t do well on the leaderboard, her song was still a big hit,"" he says. ""So it doesn’t necessarily matter where you place, and that’s the approach I’m taking. ""I just want to deliver something that I can look back on in years to come and go, ‘I did that’."""

Those with more than 2,500 verified followers - people already paying for X Premium - have been given premium features for free. As well as the blue tick, the users will see fewer adverts on X. The social media platform also announced it was clearing bots so people may notice follower numbers decreasing. Blue ticks were originally a way to verify users were who they claimed to be, but they became a paid-for feature after Elon Musk purchased the site. However, according to messages received by people who have been given the features, it is now being given out without cost if a person is an ""influential member of the community"". Premium users also see their tweets ranked higher when replying to others, and it enables them to apply for revenue sharing from adverts on the site. Meanwhile, people with more than 5,000 verified followers have been given free access to Premium+, which removes almost all adverts and ranks their tweets even higher when replying to another person. It comes after Mr Musk announced the feature in late March. Before X was bought by Mr Musk, the blue tick was a badge of verification given for free by the platform. It was originally used as a tool of authentication, designed to help stop fake accounts and the spread of misinformation. The blue tick was once seen as a marker of a person's authoritativeness on the site, as only a few people could become verified, such as celebrities, government workers and journalists. Mr Musk disliked this system, which he criticised as creating a split between ""lords and peasants"". Under the billionaire, the blue tick instead became a symbol showing that an account had subscribed to X Premium - previously called Twitter Blue - with a verification process attached to that payment. But now it has become a combination of the two - with a person simply seen as prominent if they are followed by enough people with a checkmark of their own."

Activists at the university in New York City seized Hamilton Hall early on Tuesday, barricading themselves inside. One student said the campus was ""lawless"", as officials grapple with the long-running demo which has prompted a wave of rallies elsewhere. Columbia has urged students and staff to stay away from campus on Tuesday. It earlier began suspending students who defied Monday's deadline of 14:00 EST (18:00 GMT) to leave their two-week encampment nearby. But as the deadline passed, dozens of students rallied at the site. Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), one of the main protest groups, vowed to defy the order in a post on X, and called on activists to ""protect the encampment"". The group later announced the takeover of Hamilton Hall, highlighting that the venue was also the focus of student protests in 1968. Another group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), said it had ""reclaimed"" the building in honour of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old girl found dead in Gaza earlier this year. One student described the campus as ""lawless, utter anarchy"", with demonstrators breaking the building's windows to enter, before blocking the doors with furniture. Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Jessica Schwalb said the group had entered with ""bags full of stuff"", adding: ""I'm guessing they're going to be living in there indefinitely."" Demonstrations have rocked campuses across the US in recent weeks, sparked by New York police clearing an earlier encampment at Columbia. Hundreds of people have been arrested across the country - among them dozens of protesters at the University of Texas at Austin on Monday. Officials there said protesters had ignored directions to take down their tents and that ""baseball-size rocks"" had been found in the encampment. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has voiced his concern that some law enforcement actions witnessed on American campuses have been ""disproportionate in their impacts"". ""Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society,"" he added in a statement. At Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, students said police used tear gas and pepper spray against their gathering on Monday. The university said the group had been ""repeatedly"" asked to leave, and echoed other institutions by saying many of those involved in the demonstration were not students. Elsewhere, there has been a rare agreement reached in Evanston, Illinois, between Northwestern University and protesters who have camped out for days in solidarity with the Palestinians. Under the deal, the university said it would permit ""peaceful demonstrations"", provided the encampment was limited to a single tent. Activists across the US are demanding that their universities, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties. Pressure has been building on the leadership of Columbia - an elite Ivy League university in Upper Manhattan - to act, or step aside. Posting on X before the occupation of Hamilton Hall, US House Speaker Mike Johnson labelled the scenes at Columbia an ""utter disgrace"" and called on the university's president to step down. Columbia's campus has become the focal point of the country's debate over the war in Gaza and US support for Israel, as well as fears that antisemitism is putting Jewish students in danger. Earlier on Monday, a group of House Democrats urged its board of trustees to resign if it could not ""act decisively, disband the encampment, and ensure the safety and security of all of its students"". Annual tuition and fees for Columbia add up to around $90,000 (£72,000) for undergraduates, making it one of the most expensive universities in the US. More than 100 people were arrested when police raided the earlier encampment on 18 April. But activists redoubled their efforts, regrouping in another encampment and prompting university leadership to move to hybrid learning. A statement on Monday from Columbia's president, Dr Minouche Shafik, reiterated that the university ""will not divest from Israel"", and that talks between academic leaders and student organisers had failed to result in an agreement. Several hours after the deadline passed for students to take down their camp - and before the break-in at Hamilton Hall was reported - another official said the university had started to suspend students. This makes them ineligible to graduate. Officials say they want to avoid any disruption to graduation ceremonies on 15 May. Another of the protesters' demands is amnesty for activists who face disciplinary action from the university. For now, the cluster of tents remains in place. Mahmoud Khalil, one of the students who has been negotiating with Columbia officials, told the BBC that protesters believed it was ""highly probable"" that police would again be called in again. ""The students are here,"" added Mr Khalil, who said he was a Palestinian refugee who grew up in Syria. ""They are holding their ground."" Many wore face coverings, telling the BBC they were worried about being recognised and facing recrimination. But the university wrote in its letter on Monday that it had already identified several participants. The BBC is tracking protests or encampments on campuses in at least 22 other states and Washington DC. They have also been reported in Canada, France and Australia. Jewish students on numerous campuses have voiced concern about their safety, amid alleged incidents of harassment and threats of violence by some protests participants, The White House is walking an increasingly fine line over the campus protests, seeking to balance the right to peaceful protest with condemnation of hate speech. ""It is a painful moment, we get that,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Declining to say how university leadership should act, she added: ""Free expression has to be done within the law."" Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have also highlighted antisemitic chants and incidents at the protests."
politics,politics,Negative,"[""Kharkiv's"", 'Thermal Power Plant', 'Power Plant No.5', 'Telegram', 'the US Congress', 'Twitter', 'Patriot']",Ukraine's power plants at the mercy of Russian missiles,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68813529,2024-04-15,0.16582527272239123,Scandal,False,Desertification,"Russia's war on Ukraine has entered a new phase. Drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are now frequent and massive, overwhelming its current air defences. They often include the same Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Tehran at Israel. Seeing the robust response to that attack by Israel's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that when it came to Ukraine ""rhetoric does not protect the sky"". He said the sound of those drones, whether over the Middle East or in Europe, ""must serve as a wake-up call to the free world"". Officials in Ukraine say they can ""count on one hand"" the thermal and hydro power plants across the country that are not yet badly damaged or totally destroyed. As Ukraine scrambles to repair what it can, and keep the electricity flowing to homes and industry, Russia's assault has not stopped. A major facility close to Kyiv was hit last week and to the northeast, in Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, all three major power plants are in ruins. The red-and-white striped chimneys of Kharkiv's Thermal Power Plant No.5 are still visible from miles away. Approach a little closer, and the destruction beneath is revealed. The main building has a huge hole blown through the heart of it. All around is a mess of blackened metal and smashed concrete. The attack on 22 March was deliberate and devastating. Five Russian missiles struck the same spot, mangling turbines, generators and transformers and taking the plant offline. A week later, Russia targeted the city's power plants again. For Ihor Orlovskiy this feels personal. ""It's like looking at the ruins of your own home. It brings pain and tears,"" the deputy director says, leading me across chunks of metal and stone to the spot where the missiles exploded. He's worked here since Soviet times. ""It's a very bitter feeling. But this mobilises us too, to build back. Because we know a city of more than a million people is depending on us."" There have been six attacks on this plant since the start of the full-scale invasion, but the one in March was the worst by far. It was also the most demoralising: it took engineers a full year to repair one section of the plant, then two weeks after it was restarted Russia hit exactly the same spot. Other industry sources tell similar stories of increasingly accurate strikes. In the past, they say, missiles would fall short or cause less damage. That leads some to suspect Russian agents inside Ukraine are feeding information to Moscow: the power plants cover vast territory and the damage, or repairs, are impossible to conceal. But Russia already knows where to target. The heavy machinery dates back to the USSR, there are still Soviet labels on the ruins, and Moscow has the old blueprints of the plants. Ihor Orlovskiy suspects the increased precision is more likely down to the sheer intensity of recent attacks. ""When you launch five, six, seven missiles at the same spot, some are bound to hit."" In the fields all around there are giant electricity pylons. But since March there's been nothing flowing along the lines from Power Plant No.5, or Kharkiv's other thermal power plants. The city has to bring in power from western Ukraine, which means limited supply and regular blackouts. The Russians have targeted electricity substations too. Local authorities are scrambling to minimise the impact and reduce the time homes and businesses are left in the dark. Residents have learned to charge their devices, and multiple power banks, as soon as the electricity comes on. They also keep reserves of water for drinking and washing. The Kharkiv metro is back working, albeit in fits and starts, and so are the traffic lights. But with an unreliable power supply that could get worse, businesses are creating their own solutions. Kharkiv is a major publishing hub and Oleksandr Popovich, the boss of a large printing firm, says for weeks they have been relying on three generators. Early in the war a missile hit 100m (330ft) from the main production line. ""It destroyed all our storage and 10 tonnes of paper. But a tough day only makes us tougher,"" says Mr Popovich, radiating the spirit of defiance and determination that has become Kharkiv's trademark. ""Unfortunately, I can't fix the electricity,"" he says. ""But everyone has to do their own job. Mine is to produce books until our victory. We must keep working. We must give people in Ukraine the chance to read new books."" Listen: Ukrainecast: Could Russia take Kharkiv? The firm did consider relocating further away from the Russian border, but they decided to stay and have even invested in increasing production. Now that Russia is targeting Kharkiv with renewed focus he admits to worrying: ""Then I think about our army. Our soldiers need to know they are not defending empty cities. They are defending cities with people."" Dozens of his own staff have signed up to fight. The photograph of one, killed in action on the eastern front line, hangs beside the main entrance. Reports from the front are now sobering. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksander Syrskyi, said at the weekend the situation along sections of the front line had ""significantly worsened"". Warmer weather and firmer ground were helping Russia launch assaults in armoured vehicles and put Ukrainian forces under renewed pressure, he wrote on Telegram. Fighting around Chasiv Yar in the Donbas is especially intense. The general believes Russia wants to take the territory by 9 May, a symbolic date when Moscow celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Gen Syrskyi described the ""heroic"" efforts of his troops in ""holding back the enemy's daily attacks"". But he also mentioned the need to improve their ""moral and psychological"" state. After more than two years, they are exhausted. But when MPs in Kyiv finally voted on a new law regulating how men are mobilised, the amendment setting a limit for how long they have to fight had been removed. Against the larger army of its enemy, Ukraine needs all the soldiers it can muster. The slip in morale is compounded by a shortage of ammunition now reaching the front lines and the continuing failure of the US Congress to approve a critical package of aid for Kyiv. Ukraine's troops, like everyone here, sense their war sliding down the international agenda. And now there's new cause for dismay, as many note the difference in response to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Israel has had direct support to protect its skies from Iranian missiles and drones, even as the same countries limit their help to Ukraine which is under Russian attack every day. President Zelensky hinted at the frustration in his condemnation of Iran's actions . ""The world cannot wait for discussions to go on,"" Ukraine's president wrote on Twitter, or X. ""Words do not stop drones and do not intercept missiles. Only tangible assistance does. The assistance we are anticipating."" Germany has just promised to send an additional Patriot air defence unit to Ukraine ""immediately"". Thanking Chancellor Olaf Scholz for the support at a ""critical moment"", Volodymyr Zelensky urged other countries to follow suit. The staff of Kharkiv's power plant No.5 would welcome the protection. ""We'd only just repaired things, and now we have to start all over again,"" a worker called Yury told me. ""We will sort it, but the main thing is not to get hit again!"" As he and others assess the damage, salvage what they can and draw up a plan for rebuilding, they face numerous air raid sirens every day. There are two kinds of alert, a fire safety officer explains. If the threat seems focused around the border, about 40km (25 miles) away, some keep working. ""But if we see there's a rocket risk for Kharkiv then there's an announcement: 'Urgent! To the shelter immediately!',"" he says. That slows the recovery work and it shatters the nerves. Any missile fired at Kharkiv will hit within seconds, and the staff are surrounded by stark evidence of the danger. But it's not just the engineers and construction teams back at work. When we arrived at the plant, a group of women were out cleaning the paths, painting the kerb, even pulling up dandelions around the main entrance. A little later I found them down in the shelter during another air raid. ""Life goes on, and we still need to keep things nice,"" said one woman, despite the entire power plant being in tatters. ""We like to keep things clean and in order. It's our job. But it's also good for the spirit!"" The women had also painted the underground shelter in a fresh ""salad"" green, adding a splash of cheer to a Cold War-era bunker built to withstand nuclear attack by the West. Instead it protects Ukrainians from ballistic missiles launched by their neighbour. ""They say it's so we surrender, that they want to frighten us into running from here,"" another woman chips in as the air raid ends and she prepares to head back up to work. ""They want us to leave Kharkiv. But we won't do that."" Produced by Hanna Tsyba and Kostas Kallergis"

The claimants allege that in order to obtain a licence to operate in the city, the ride-hailing giant deliberately misled Transport for London (TfL) about how its app worked. Litigation management firm RGL Management says the claim is worth at least £250m, with cabbies potentially getting £25,000 each. “These old claims are completely unfounded,"" an Uber spokesperson told the BBC. ""Uber operates lawfully in London, is fully licensed by TfL, and is proud to serve millions of passengers and drivers across the capital,” they added. TfL did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The group action focuses on Uber's operations in London between May 2012 and March 2018. The claimants also allege that Uber's intention was to ""unlawfully... take business from existing black cab drivers"", according to a statement by RGL. ""Uber seems to believe it is above the law and cabbies across London have suffered loss of earnings because of it,"" said Garry White, who has been a black cab driver for 36 years.  ""It is time they were held to account.” Law firm Mishcon de Reya has filed the group action in the High Court on behalf of the claimants. ""Uber has consistently failed to comply with the law that applies to private hire vehicles in London"" said Richard Leedham, partner and head of commercial disputes at Mishcon de Reya. Over the years, Uber has faced a number of challenges in London, as well other cities around the world. TfL refused to renew the company's licence in 2017, saying it showed ""a lack of corporate responsibility"" with ""public safety and security implications"". At the time, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi apologised for past mistakes and said the firm would dispute the decision. Uber successfully appealed after renewal of the licence was again denied two years later. In 2022, a two-and-a-half-year licence to operate in London was granted. It is due to expire at the end of September. Uber has also been the focus of demonstrations organised by London's black cab drivers. Earlier this year, Uber agreed to pay A$271.8m ($177.7m; £141.7m) to settle a lawsuit in Australia, according to a law firm for taxi operators and drivers. Maurice Blackburn Lawyers filed the class action on behalf of more than 8,000 taxi and hire car owners and drivers. The case alleged they lost income when the ride-hailing giant ""aggressively"" moved into the country. ""Since 2018, Uber has made significant contributions into various state-level taxi compensation schemes, and with today's proposed settlement, we put these legacy issues firmly in our past,"" Uber said in a statement. The company did not disclose the size of the proposed settlement. In December 2023, Uber won a lawsuit brought against it by 2,500 taxi drivers in France. A Paris commercial court ruled that Uber had not committed acts of unfair competition. San Francisco-based Uber, which was founded in 2009, operates in around 70 countries and more than 10,000 cities globally."

""It's very important to do everything to isolate Iran,"" European Council President Charles Michel said. The bloc already has multiple sanctions in place against Iran, including for selling drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. The US has hinted it will impose its own new penalties in the coming days. The EU's new sanctions were agreed during a summit in Brussels which marked the first meeting between the bloc's 27 leaders since Iran's direct assault on Israel on Saturday, involving more than 300 missiles and drones fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen which were mostly downed by Israel and its allies. Tehran has maintained it was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. Israel - which appears to have only countered with a diplomatic offensive so far - has not ruled out a response. But world leaders have continued to urge restraint, in a bid to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. ""For us, it is important that this moment is now also used for further de-escalation and that Israel also uses this success to strengthen its position in the whole region and not respond with a massive attack of its own,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Wednesday's meeting. Israel has called on its allies to sanction Tehran's missile programme and for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major military and political force in Iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation, something the US has done but the EU and UK have not. The EU already has a wide range of measures in place which target Iran over its human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia. Speaking about the possibility of further sanctions on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that ""all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table"". She also signalled that Iran's oil exports could be ""a possible area"" Washington targets. ""Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do.""

The certificates were sent to them all for ""a significant contribution to the development and maintenance of vital activities of the military"". They were signed by the commander of the Airborne Assault Forces of Ukraine. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has controversially been encouraging volunteer hackers to attack Russian targets. But sending out official awards to foreign civilians is being seen as a controversial move and a sign of the times. Although many nations, including the UK and the US, have official award systems for ethical hacking, this is thought to be the first time a country has awarded hackers for malicious and possibly criminal hacks. In October, in response to the increase in vigilante hacking in Ukraine and in the Gaza conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned against the use and encouragement of civilian hackers. It published guidelines to reinforce the ethos of the rules of war laid out in the existing Geneva Conventions. Dr Lukasz Olejnik, author of Philosophy of Cyber-security, said Ukraine's awards to foreign hackers are potentially problematic. ""Giving out awards may further blur the lines between combatants and civilians, and even undermine the recent call by the ICRC to limit and end the involvement of civilians in combat operations. In the long run, such an erosion is dangerous,"" he said. Dr Olejnik also said it is a ""testament of our times"" that cyber is now considered as a domain of operations and that anyone can join the fight online. Kristopher started hacking Russia when it launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and says he has devoted himself to the cause and sacrificed a lot. ""I've lost my job doing this and spent all my life savings in pursuit of a victory for Ukraine,"" he said from his home office. ""This award is a real morale-booster,"" he said. The awards do not state which cyber-attacks were most useful, but Voltage has three in mind as the most likely candidates. At the start of the invasion in 2022, One Fist spent months mapping out the physical and cyber-locations of hundreds of publicly viewable CCTV cameras in Ukraine. It was discovered that Russian forces were using them to monitor troops, so his team helped get the cameras switched off. Conversely, it was One Fist that hacked into cameras in occupied Crimea to catalogue Russian tanks and equipment being moved over the Kerch bridge. And most recently, in January, Kristopher and others also successfully hacked into a prominent Russian weapons-maker and stole 100 gigabytes of private data, which led to a public celebration from the Ukrainian authorities. ""The array of information transferred to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine contains drawings, specifications, patents, software referring to both existing and promising military developments,"" the announcement said. Ukraine added that the data stolen was a ""significant blow"" to Moscow and worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) - although it did not say how this figure was reached The Ukraine conflict prompted a surge of cyber-activity - mostly from supporters of Ukraine. Groups like the Anonymous collective targeted Russia with disruptive and low-level hacks that Russia largely brushed off. In some instances, TV and radio stations were hijacked and news websites defaced. Russian authorities too have been accused of working with vigilante hacking groups like Killnet to attack Ukraine, but has never admitted having any relationship to the gangs. Most of the vigilante hacking activity on both sides dissipated after the first year as the war ground on. But One Fist has kept attacking Russia and increasingly worked closely with the Ukrainian forces on choosing targets. Emily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs and editor of Chatham House Cyber Policy journal, agrees that the hacking awards are a landmark moment that might shift thinking about how cyber volunteers are used in conflicts. ""Governments usually discourage non-state actors from taking direct action in the cyber-domain, for fear of escalation or unintended consequences, but wartime is often a period of extraordinary technological innovation, and the Ukraine invasion is no exception,"" she said. ""Sometimes these events force a reconsideration of issues that have previously been taboo."" Kristopher says his team has built up a strong relationship with the Ukrainian military. ""They send us ideas and we send them options but they don't ever give us any help or funding as I think that would cross some sort of line,"" he said. Kristopher recognises that receiving military awards is controversial, but is determined to keep hacking for Ukraine."

Dr Adnan Al-Bursh, 50, was the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa Hospital. The Israeli prison service confirmed that a statement published on 19 April about a prisoner who was detained for national security reasons and had died in Ofer prison was Dr Al-Bursh. No details were given on the cause of death, and the prison service said the incident was being investigated. But the Palestinian prisoner advocacy groups said in a joint statement on Thursday that Dr Al-Bursh's death was an ""assassination"" and his body still remained in Israeli custody. Dr Al-Bursh was the head of orthopaedics at Gaza's largest medical facility, al-Shifa hospital, which has been raided several times by Israeli armed forces. He was temporarily working at Al-Awada hospital in north Gaza when he was detained by Israeli forces. Colleagues have paid tribute to the late surgeon, describing him as ""compassionate"" and ""heroic"". Al-Shifa's director, Dr Marwan Abu Saada, said the news of his death was difficult for the human soul to bear. Another colleague, Dr Suhail Matar, called Dr Al-Bursh “the safety valve” for every orthopaedic department in all of Gaza’s hospitals. ""It is rare that you meet a person like him in your life, because this doctor worked all his life with dedication and used to make tremendous efforts at the expense of himself,"" Dr Matar told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. He described his late colleague as someone who was never tired of working, and who was ""loved by everyone and his smile never went away"". Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza, said she was ""extremely alarmed"" by news of Dr Al-Bursh's death and called on the diplomatic community to take concrete measures to protect Palestinians. Meanwhile White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has discussed with Israel the importance of protecting humanitarian workers in Gaza. ""The president has said very clearly that when it comes to people who are... in Gaza providing that all-important care, humanitarian aid, humanitarian care, they need to be protected. They should be protected. And so certainly those conversations are going to continue,"" she said. ""We believe that certainly... the Israeli government has taken efforts to do just that and has taken into account our concerns and so we're going to continue to have those conversations but it is heartbreaking to hear."" Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that Dr Al-Bursh’s death meant that the total number of medical workers who had been killed by Israel since the 7 October attack now stands at 496. It added that 1,500 others had been wounded while 309 had been arrested. Medical facilities are protected under international law, but Israel says Hamas uses them as cover for military operations - something Hamas denies. The BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment."

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said protecting the rights of Ukrainians was still key but ""the main priority is to protect our homeland from destruction"" during Russia's full-scale invasion. Russia has a big advantage in numbers and weapons on the battlefield. Kyiv recently lowered the age of mobilisation from 27 to 25. After ""inviting"" Ukrainian men abroad to return home last December, it seems the government wants to apply more pressure, by denying them potentially vital services overseas. With the recent passing of the controversial new mobilisation law, Kyiv seems to be past the point of caring about unpopular decisions. Mr Kuleba wrote on social media that ""fair attitudes"" would be restored for Ukrainian men of military age both at home and abroad. He complained that at the moment it appeared that men of conscription age were leaving their country, then expecting to receive services from the state: ""It does not work this way. Our country is at war."" It is not yet clear who Ukraine's new consular restrictions will apply to, with many Ukrainian men abroad having legitimate exemptions from fighting such as being disabled or having three or more children. A letter signed by a senior foreign affairs official suggested documents would only be issued by consulates to Ukrainian men to enable them to return home. Separately, the state passport service said the issue of biometric passports outside Ukraine had been put on hold ""due to technical reasons"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a full-scale Russian offensive is expected in the coming weeks after Ukraine's loss of the city of Avdiivka during the winter. The military said its forces had been involved in 86 combat engagements on Monday alone. The US Senate is expected to approve a $60.8bn aid package for Ukraine on Tuesday, bringing to an end a six-month delay in financial support. However, Kyiv is in dire need of new manpower to defend a front line that stretches more than 1,000km (620 miles). Posters have appeared on the streets of Ukrainian cities portraying soldiers urging their compatriots to sign up to defend their country. But those who want to volunteer for the military did so long ago and are either dead, wounded or exhausted on the front lines. Instead of focusing on a rotation model, ministers are saying everyone should do their bit, for as long as it takes. However, the main criticism of Ukraine's new mobilisation law is the lack of a limit on time served, which some argue takes away what little incentive there was for men who did not want to fight anyway. A combination of this new law, hostile front lines and a recruitment system riddled with corruption claims has compelled men of fighting age to escape the country in their hundreds of thousands. The UN's refugee agency estimates that more than 6.4 million Ukrainians have fled their country, many of them to countries in the European Union. The EU's statistics agency estimates that 20.6% of the estimated 4.3 million Ukrainians currently living within its borders are men. Meanwhile, a survey by the Rating group in Ukraine suggested that 62% of Ukrainians were prepared to fight for their country at a time of war, while a third said they were not. It said that was the highest score among European nations."
business,business,Neutral,"['the Bank of England', 'Bank', 'Monetary Policy Committee', ""The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee"", 'Moneyfacts', 'L&C Mortgages', 'Bank', 'The Bank of England', 'Bank']","Why mortgage rates are going up, not down",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2xj1je97ro,2024-05-04,0.11133986253804762,Normal,False,Overfishing,"Anyone thinking of buying a first home or moving to a new one will have watched recent increases in mortgage rates with concern. The last two weeks have seen a string of lenders raise the interest rates on new fixed mortgage deals. The rises have made borrowing more expensive and potentially will mean some people having to postpone their plans. More than 1.5 million existing homeowners are remortgaging this year, and they too may have expected rates to be falling, not heading back up again. So why are rates heading upwards? The answer can be complex, and varied - but here are three reasons: Mortgage rates often pre-empt moves by the Bank of England with benchmark interest rates, also known as the base rate. Remember, higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. Markets move as they try to predict what the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee will do. In turn, that affects mortgage lenders' funding costs. ""Swap rates are when two parties exchange (or swap) interest rates to secure funding over a set period of time. Swap rates influence the price of fixed-rate mortgage deals,"" explains Jo Jingree, from the broker Mortgage Confidence. ""Right now, fixed-rate mortgages have risen because the cost of borrowing has increased for lenders - and we have a number of factors, like numerous rises in the base rate, to thank for that."" The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee makes its next decision on Thursday. Crucially, It is now not expected to cut the rate as early or as often as previously thought. So, the impact of those expectations eventually feeds through to mortgage rates, which have been creeping back up. Lenders had engaged in a mini price war at the start of the year. The average interest rate on a two-year fixed deal dropped to 5.55% near the end of January, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts. But that is as good as its been for mortgage-seekers. It has moved up since, and a flurry of activity in the last fortnight has pushed the average rate up to 5.93%. That has worried Gary Rees, whose mortgage is up for renewal in October. The 51-year-old, from Berkshire, pays about £350 a month with a mortgage interest rate of 2.4%. He is worried the rate could close to triple by the time he renews. ""I'll have to cut back, and not go out as much,"" said Mr Rees, who is registered blind. He is also considering the prospect of having to use savings to offset some of the mortgage interest, or pay down some of the capital. It will affect his standard of living, and was not quite what he was expecting. ""The mortgage is a worry and a stress that feels a bit unfair,” he said. ""I was hoping the rates would drop."" Mortgage brokers are keen to stress that the moves of recent days are not another cycle of rapidly rising rates, the likes of which were seen in the last two years. The graph above shows that mortgage rates are still below last summer's peak, and not accelerating as alarmingly as they did after the mini-budget of 2022. However, some borrowers had banked on rates going down consistently throughout the year. Two more key factors have created the current bump in the road. The reality for home buyers and owners in pounds and pence is that, compared to someone getting a mortgage a year ago, it is a little more expensive. Property portal Rightmove estimates that the average mortgage payment on a typical first-time buyer type property when taking out an average five-year fixed, 85% loan-to-value mortgage, is now £1,117 a month, up from £1,056 a year ago. However, for those remortgaging as a two-year, or particularly a five-year, current deal expires, the monthly cost could be hundreds of pounds higher because the rate could have even been below 2% when they got their last deal. The outlook for the coming months among commentators is still broadly more positive, but will create some food for thought for borrowers. ""This is not one-way traffic and could change again soon,"" said David Hollingworth of L&C Mortgages. Any suggestion from the Bank that it could move soon on benchmark interest rates - even if it holds at the current level on Thursday - could bring mortgage rates down again. Matt Smith, from Rightmove, said: ""The Bank of England meeting will be quite key for setting the tone for mortgage rates leading into summer."" The markets still expect base rate cuts as the year goes on, but quite how far and how often the Bank goes with them is open to question. Anyone remortgaging may have three or six months prior to the deadline to lock in a deal, and may be able to change to a better rate during that time if the situation improves. Doing nothing during a time of uncertainty can be expensive, if borrowers are moved on to a default variable rate when their fixed deal expires. ""There are still plenty of good deals available,"" said Mrs Jingree. ""It’s a good reminder not to wait for a better deal to become available, as rates don’t always follow predictions and expectations."" Read more here"

He's now the head of quantum biotechnology at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency. ""I've got a bit of a weird background. I always wanted to be a diesel mechanic. Doing that for a while led to wanting to do engineering at university. That introduced me to the physics, and then to the quantum physics. A rollercoaster ride is a good way to describe it,"" he says. His team has been developing diagnostic technologies, experimenting with micro sensors crafted from tiny slivers of diamonds about 50 nanometers in size (about 1,000 times finer than human hair) to test patients' iron levels. Current methods monitor a protein known as ferritin, the body's iron storage mechanism. While monitoring ferritin is a good way to measure iron, it would be more accurate to measure the actual iron levels inside the protein. One way to do that would be to measure the tiny magnetic fields generated by the iron. But there's one big problem with that approach. ""[The magnetic field] is completely tiny and outside the measurement of any traditional magnetometers or microscopes,"" explains Dr Hall. However, Dr Hall's nano-scale quantum sensors can detect those tiny fields and measure them. He says in the future, the technology could develop an early flag for any particular disease, including the surveillance of certain hormones or proteins that might indicate cancer. ""The advantage for quantum systems has always been that you can achieve much, much better sensitivity and easier identification of chemicals at a much lower cost,"" Dr Hall says. Dr Hall is part of a global push to develop quantum technologies. Britain, China, the US and countries elsewhere, are all trying to exploit the weird properties of quantum mechanics. ""Quantum is one of Australia's most promising growth opportunities - a chance to create new markets, new applications,"" said CSIRO's chief scientist, Prof Bronwyn Fox. Quantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th Century from studies of nature's smallest objects. Scientists believe it has the potential to expand our understanding of the universe and solve complex problems at lightning speeds. The range of applications appears vast; from advances in environmental science and decarbonisation, to cyber-security and new medicines.  There could be molecules that ""eat up carbon"" and remove it from the atmosphere, quantum batteries to power cars, aircraft that are designed to lower their emissions and transport logistics to reduce road congestion. One ambition of quantum research is to harness the power of sub-atomic particles to store and process data. While conventional computing generally uses bits (zeroes and ones), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist as zeroes, ones, or combinations of both at once. This is where things can get a bit strange, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (this is called superposition), and also be intertwined (or entangled) with each other. ""Using that principle of quantum superposition together with another quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, it enables you to perform calculations that are simply impossible using conventional computers. It opens up the possibility of doing some quite amazing calculations that can be world changing,"" explains Prof Andrew Dzurak from the University of New South Wales. More technology of business ""Imagine a new branch of Covid or another horrible pandemic. Once you understand the molecular structure of that, which can be done using standard experimental techniques, you then go to the quantum computer and you calculate how to make a molecule that specifically attacks that virus. ""You solve that problem in a day rather than in the six or nine months that it took all of the greatest biological and pharmaceutical minds on the planet to come up with the vaccines for Covid."" The power driving quantum computing comes from entanglement, a natural phenomena, according to Dr Muhammed Usman, a team leader at Data 61, a business within CSIRO. It's complex and not easy to grasp. Special particles, often photons, or flecks of light, can be in two places at the same time, but remain strongly connected even though they are not physically linked. ""I would say that nobody in the world fully understands the basics of entanglement,"" is Dr Usman's honest assessment. Could there be a quantum internet? Quite possibly. Data might be despatched through optical fibres using particles of light making it almost impossible to be eavesdropped or hacked. In the US, the University of Chicago has built one of the country's longest quantum networks. It is almost 200km (124 miles) long and growing. David Awschalom is the Liew Family Professor of Molecular Engineering and Physics at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. He is also the founding director of the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE), a consortium based at the University of Chicago that has collaborations with experts in Australia, India, Japan, the Netherlands and Israel. The CQE also leads The Bloch Quantum Tech Hub, a coalition of industry, academic, government, and nonprofit partners that expects to create 30,000 quantum jobs by 2035 and generate $60bn for the economy. ""We've extended how far we can send secure quantum messages through many miles of underground fiber,"" he explains. ""But there are significant challenges to overcome. With quantum computing, for instance, we are working on maintaining quantum coherence, which means keeping a quantum system intact; error correction, which means detecting and correcting errors caused by decoherence; and scalability, which means being able to increase the number of qubits in a quantum system to solve more complex problems."" Years of painstaking research lie ahead, but the future appears to hurtling quickly towards us. ""Quantum artificial intelligence is one of the key areas of research in our team.  Machine learning and artificial intelligence is very computationally intensive and quantum computing promises computational power,"" explains Dr Usman from CSIRO. ""For example, self-driving cars or drones flying in battlefields with lethal weapons. Can we trust artificial intelligence? So, what we have found is that integrating quantum computing in artificial intelligence leads to very reliable and trustworthy systems,"" he said. ""My dream come true would be that large-scale quantum computers are available and we can run quantum algorithms that I am developing to find solutions to the problems that we haven't found yet, and that will revolutionise everything."""

The station in the main city Dnipro came under attack, and several homes were hit further east in Synelnykove. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack showed that all Ukrainian cities needed more advanced air defences. In a separate strike, Ukraine said that for the first time it had downed a strategic long-range bomber in Russia. Officials said a boy aged eight and a girl of 14 were among five people killed when private homes were targeted by Russian strikes on the town of Synelnykove. A six-year-old boy, who had earlier been reported killed, was in a critical condition and several other people were wounded, Dnipropetrovsk regional head Serhiy Lysak said. Another two people were killed in the regional capital, Dnipro, when the train station and a five-storey building were hit. More than 30 people were injured in Friday's attack in the region. Rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia said a woman who was on duty at the time was killed and seven other railway workers were hurt. Rescue services were continuing to search the rubble and warned that the number of victims would rise, the ministry added. A maternity hospital was also hit. President Zelensky said that Ukraine and its allies ""must defeat Russian terror"", urging Kyiv's partners to urgently provide more advanced air defence systems. He added that he visited Ukrainian troops close to the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region on Friday. Ukraine has for months warned that it is running low on weapons capable of bringing down Russian missiles and drones, and Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has spoken of an ""urgent, critical need"" for fresh military aid. Earlier this week, the northern city of Chernihiv was struck in Russia's deadliest attack for some time, leaving 18 dead and dozens wounded. Three Iskander cruise missiles hit residential buildings close to the centre of the city, the regional leader said. For months, a US military aid package worth $60.8bn (£49bn) has been blocked by Republican representatives in Congress. However, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has said he is determined to bring the matter to a vote, which could take place as early as Saturday. Meanwhile, the air force in Kyiv said it had brought down a Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bomber 300km (186 miles) from Ukrainian territory. It said the plane eventually went down in Russia's Stavropol region after it had launched a missile strike on Ukraine. Ukraine's defence intelligence described the strike as a special operation similar to an earlier attack on a Russian long-range radar plane. In January, Ukraine's military said it had brought down an A-50 spy plane and a control centre plane over the Sea of Azov. A source in Ukrainian intelligence later told the BBC the Russian bomber was shot down using a Soviet-era S-200 air defence system, which is believed to have been upgraded. Unverified video on Friday showed a plane on fire spiralling out of control to the ground and Stavropol regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov said only that the plane had crashed in a Russian field some distance north of the main city. Russia's defence ministry blamed a technical malfunction after the bomber had carried out a ""combat task"". Two pilots had been found alive, a third crew member was killed and rescue services were looking for a fourth, the governor said. Ukrainian air force chief Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk said Russia had fired six Kh-22 cruise missiles overnight and two of them had been destroyed for the first time. The Tu-22M3 is described as a supersonic bomber and the air force commander said the planes were used to carry Kh-22 missiles for attacks on Ukrainian cities."

In March, a man called Noland Arbaugh demonstrated that he could play chess using only his mind . After living with paralysis for eight years, he had gained the ability to perform tasks previously inaccessible to him, thanks to a brain implant designed by Neuralink, a company founded by Elon Musk. ""It just became intuitive for me to imagine the cursor moving,"" Arbaugh said in a live stream . ""I just stare somewhere on the screen, and it would move where I wanted it to."" Arbaugh's description alludes to a sense of his own agency: he was suggesting he was responsible for moving the chess piece. However, was it him or the implant that performed the actions? As a philosopher of mind and AI ethicist, I am fascinated by this question. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies like Neuralink symbolise a new era in the intertwining of the human brain and machines, asking us to reconsider our intuitions about identity, the self and personal responsibility. In the near-term, the technology promises many benefits for people like Arbaugh, but the applications could go further. The company's long-term vision is to make such implants available to the general population to augment and enhance their abilities too. If a machine can perform acts once reserved for the cerebral matter inside our skulls, should it be considered an extension of the human mind, or something separate? For decades, philosophers have debated the borders of personhood: where does our mind end, and the external world begin? On a simple level, you might assume that our minds rest within our brains and bodies. However, some philosophers have proposed that it's more complicated than that. In 1998, the philosophers David Chalmers and Andy Clarke presented the ""extended mind"" hypothesis , suggesting that technology could become part of us. In philosophical language, the pair proposed an active externalism , a view in which humans can delegate facets of their thought processes to external artefacts, thereby integrating these artefacts into the human mind itself. This was before the smartphone, but it predicted the way that we now offload cognitive tasks to our devices, from wayfinding to memory. As a thought experiment, Chalmers and Clarke also imagined a scenario ""in the cyberpunk future"" where somebody with a brain implant manipulated objects on a screen – much like Arbaugh has just done. To play chess, Arbaugh imagines what he wants, like moving a pawn or bishop. And his implant, in this case Neuralink's N1, picks up neural patterns of his intent, before decoding, processing, and executing actions. So, what should we make of this philosophically now that it's actually happened? Is Arbaugh's implant part of his mind, entwined with his intentions? If it's not, then it poses thorny questions about whether he has true ownership of his actions. To understand why, let's consider a conceptual distinction: happenings and doings . Happenings encapsulate the entirety of our mental processes, such as our thoughts, beliefs, desires, imaginations, contemplations, and intentions. Doings are happenings that are acted upon, such as the finger movements you're using to scroll down this article right now. Usually, the gap between happenings and doings does not exist. For instance, let's take the case of a hypothetical woman, Nora – not a BCI-integrated person – playing chess. She can form an intention through regulating her happenings to move the pawn to d3, and simply does so by moving her hand. In Nora's case, the intention and the doing are inseparable; she can attribute the action of moving the pawn to herself. For Arbaugh, however, he must imagine his intent, and it's the implant that performs the action in the external world. Here, happenings and doings are separate. More like this: This raises some serious concerns, such as whether a person using a brain implant to augment their abilities can gain executive control over their BCI-integrated actions. While human brains and bodies already produce plenty of involuntary actions, from sneezes to clumsiness to pupil dilation, could implant-controlled actions feel alien? Might the implant seem like a parasitic intruder gnawing away at the sanctity of a person's volition? I call this problem the contemplation conundrum . In Arbaugh's case, he skips crucial stages of the causal chain, such as the movement of his hand that instantiates his chess move. What happens if Arbaugh first thinks of moving his pawn to d3 but, within a fraction of a second, changes his mind and realises he would rather move it to d4? Or what if he is running through possibilities in his imagination, and the implant mistakenly interprets one as an intention? The stakes are low on a chess board, but if these implants became more common, the question of personal responsibility becomes more fraught. What if, for example, bodily harm to another person was caused by an implant-controlled action? And this is not the only ethical problem these technologies raise. Perfunctory commercialisation without fully resolving the contemplation conundrum and other issues could pave the way to a dystopia reminiscent of science-fiction tales. William Gibson's novel Neuromancer, for example, highlighted how implants could lead to loss of identity, manipulation, and an erosion of privacy of thought.

The crucial question in the contemplation conundrum is when does a ""happening of imagination"" turn to ""intentional imagination to act""? When I apply my imagination to contemplate what words to use in this sentence, this is itself an intentional process. The imagination directed towards action – typing the words – is also intentional. In terms of neuroscience, differentiating between imagination and intention is nearly impossible. A study conducted in 2012 by one group of neuroscientists concluded that there are no neural events that qualify as ""intentions to act"". Without the capability to recognise neural patterns that mark this transition in someone like Arbaugh, it could be unclear which imagined scenario is the cause for effect in the physical world. This allows partial responsibility and ownership of action to fall on the implant, and questioning again whether the actions are truly his , and whether they are a part of his personhood? However, now that Chalmers and Clarke's extended mind thought experiment has manifested into reality, I propose revisiting their foundational ideas as one method to bridge the divide between happenings and doings in people with brain implants. The adoption of the extended mind hypothesis would allow someone like Arbaugh to hold responsibility over their actions rather than divide it with the implant. This cognitive view suggests that to experience something as one's own, one must think about it as one's own . In other words, they must think of the implant as a part of their self-identity and within the borders of their inner life. If so, a sense of agency, ownership, and responsibility can follow. Brain implants like Arbaugh's have undoubtedly opened a new door for philosophical discussions about the border between mind and machine. The debate over action and agency has traditionally circled around the skin and skull boundary of identity. However, with brain implants, this boundary has become malleable – and that means the self may extend further into technology than ever before. Or as Chalmers and Clarke observed: ""Once the hegemony of skin and skull is usurped, we may be able to see ourselves more truly as creatures of the world."" * Dvija Mehta is an AI ethics researcher and philosopher of mind at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, University of Cambridge. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Workers in Tennessee voted 73% in favour, according to the union's unofficial vote count on Friday night. It handed the UAW its first election win at a car factory in the American South in decades. Two prior votes at the factory, including in 2019, had failed, after stiff political opposition. But attitudes toward organised labour appear to be shifting. The US has seen an increase in strikes and petitions to join unions since the pandemic, drawing in Hollywood actors, Starbucks baristas, tech contractors, healthcare workers, and even college basketball players. Workers at the only VW factory the US, in Chattanooga, will now be represented by the union to negotiate collectively over issues such as pay and working conditions. Analysts said the outcome could inspire employees at other factories in the region to take similar steps. Another UAW election is scheduled for May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama, and the union has begun a push at other factories, as well. UAW boss Shawn Fain last year said the UAW would target 13 foreign-owned factories in the South, in a bid to bring in new members to the organisation, whose numbers have steadily dwindled. The plans aimed to seize on the momentum of the organisation's headline-drawing strike last year that won significant pay increases and other benefits for union workers at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. But it marked a risky push for the organisation, which is closely associated with the Democratic party, into a part of the country that is both staunchly Republican and historically hostile to unions. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican, was among the political leaders to speak out against the UAW effort. But unlike in 2019, when the governor addressed workers at a meeting hosted by Volkswagen, the political opposition was more muted this time and Volkswagen said it was remaining officially neutral in the fight. Before the election, analysts said the UAW had its best shot in years at winning, noting new leadership had refreshed the reputation and approach of the organisation, which had been mired in corruption scandals. UAW membership peaked in 1979 at almost 1.5 million. Today, it represents more than 400,000 active workers across a wide range of sectors, including hospitals and universities, with more than 140,000 members employed at Ford, GM and Stellantis."

It's not necessarily company carelessness – but it's still a big problem. The saying goes, ""good things come in small packages"". But many online shoppers don't know that joy. If you order a comb the size of an envelope, there's a good chance it will arrive on your doorstep in a cardboard box that could fit a trombone. This trend is more than just annoying – it's a sustainability nightmare. More than three billion trees are cut down every year to make the paper-based packaging that ends up cluttering your home or stuffed in a refuse bin, says Nicole Rycroft, executive director of Canopy, an environmental non-profit that works with companies to preserve endangered forests. Paper packaging production volumes have increased by 65% throughout the past two decades , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The spike in online shopping is only making things worse. ""In the early days of e-commerce, [products] had seven-times more packaging than with a brick-and-mortar purchase,"" says Rycroft. ""It's now around four-and-a-half times as much, but still, that's a lot of excessive packaging."" Yet companies aren't simply being careless in the mismatch between product and container sizing, notes Barry Kronhaus, director of sales and marketing at Sun Packaging Technologies. ""It's not quite as haphazard as it might seem, he says. ""Places like Amazon and Walmart and their e-commerce fulfilment [centres] spend a lot of time trying to figure this out."" Yet the solution isn't so easy. Typically, box size is determined by using software or an algorithm – and it often finds the correct match. But humans are still involved in getting orders order to customers, which is often how goods wind up in outsize containers. For instance, a warehouse simply may not have enough of the right size of box, forcing a packer to pick the next best alternative, which is often bigger. ""When you're relying on humans and they've got 100,000 orders to get out, they have to get it done fast,"" says Kronhaus. Especially when customers are paying the shipping charges, he adds, it doesn't hurt the company's bottom line to opt for the next size up. In some cases, consumers may actually place more value on products that come in larger containers. This is called ""packaging psychology"", says Rycroft, and some companies use it to their advantage – or at least don't go out of their way to ensure boxes are right sized for their contents. An item that arrives in a large package makes the purchase seem like a good deal , according to Amsterbrand Marketing, a Dutch market research company. Buyers project human traits onto packaging that can also influence their purchasing decisions. For instance, a 2017 study on symbolic packaging clues found customers associated tall and thin food packages with health and slimness . Brands looking to target certain feelings may adapt their packaging accordingly. Whatever the reason behind the mismatch, excessive packaging creates a substantial waste problem. The larger the packaging, the larger its carbon footprint – and the more ecological devastation it can cause. While cardboard boxes from online orders are perhaps the most visible culprit, many industries use oversized packaging, primarily made from paper and plastic. Canopy estimates the food and beverage industry is the largest end-use sector for paper packaging, with beauty and personal care not far behind. And some brands in the fashion industry use as much fibre in their packaging as they do in their textiles and clothing, adds Rycloft. Currently, 54% of the pulp used to make the paper packaging that becomes boxes and filling is made from recycled paper, according to data provided by Canopy, seen by the BBC. But 43% of that pulp is still made from virgin forest fibre – new wood that has been harvested for the first time. The organisation shared with the BBC that half of this virgin fibre could be coming from forests that are designated as ""ancient and endangered"". That leaves just 3% of pulp that's made from alternative forest-free eco-friendly fibres like wheat straw or bagasse. This is a major issue as forest preservation has become integral in the fight against climate change. For the 76.3 million hectares (189.5 million acres) of primary forests in the tropics that have been lost throughout the past 20 years alone, approximately one-third of the world's total forests have been destroyed due to human activity. This includes logging for paper packaging – the demand drives about a tenth of this destruction, according to the FAO. There are other culprits, too. When those large boxes show up, they are often filled with several plastic ""air pillows"" to pad the products inside and plastic packaging presents a similar environmental scourge. Plastic can take anywhere from 20 to 500 years to break down , according to the UN. Research in 2020 from ocean conservation organisation Oceana reported that Amazon alone generated 465 million pounds (211 kg) of plastic packaging waste in 2019. The number of air pillows they alone could ""circle the Earth 500 times"". An Amazon spokesperson disputed the report , telling Vox they used ""about a quarter of the plastic packaging estimated by Oceana's report"", and that it has reduced the weight of its outbound packaging by more than a third since 2015, eliminating nearly one million tons of packaging material. To combat all the contributing detrimental effects on the environment, sustainability advocates are going directly to the retailers who are using these resource-intensive materials, both in shipping containers and in the product packaging itself. Canopy, for instance, works with companies and retailers to ensure their packaging is not coming from a high carbon, high biodiversity value forest or generating any new virgin plastic. Instead, they advise companies to transition to using recyclable, compostable and NextGen materials, which use gene editing to create synthetic fibres. EcoEnclose, a US-based company that creates sustainable packaging and shipping supplies, offers products including recycled plastic wrap and display boxes with regenerative seaweed film as more thoughtful replacements. Ideally, however, retailers should find ways to forgo excess packaging all together. Some e-commerce companies specifically are working towards this goal, both with minimising the volume and size of boxes they ship in as well as eliminating as much product packaging as possible. At global retailer Lush, about half of the beauty brand's products can be taken home with no packaging . The company has carried these efforts over to e-commerce. ""Starting in 2008, we decided to start shipping more products 'naked', to the point that currently, if products are not in a pot or bottle, they are consistently shipped naked in the box,"" says Ruth Andrade, environmental partner at Lush. More like this: Lush has also optimised box size to ensure there are appropriate options for the workers hand-packing the orders. This is part of widespread innovation throughout the past few years that Sun Packaging Technologies's Kronhaus says has enabled more accurate sizing in the packaging industry. Devices such as the dimensioning system Cubiscan scan the products needing to be boxed, and either instructs a machine to build a box that's the correct size for its contents, or determines what existing size box is best suited. According to Kronhaus, companies including Walmart and Amazon are now using this technology in certain facilities. This technology doesn't just help with shipping. It also optimises storage within warehouses – another reason some companies are jumping on board. Kronhous says innovative packaging can reduce the amount of warehouse space needed by two thirds, which saves a company money. Another storage alternative is the reuse of materials, something Rycloft says saved one of Canopy's global retailer clients €14m ($15m; £12m). By reconstituting boxes used for warehouse deliveries, they were able to reuse the boxes on average six times, resulting in an 82% reduction in overall packaging. While these moves don't directly influence the size of packages that ultimately end up on doorsteps, they are an important part of improving sustainability across the entire supply chain. While significant strides have been made towards reducing packaging waste, there's still more work ahead. In November 2022, the European Commission introduced legislation to reduce packaging waste, including excessive box size. By March 2024, however, lobbyists had succeeded in making paper packaging largely exempt from this crackdown. ""The regulation now promotes single-use paper packaging, often lined with plastic, at the cost of global forests and the climate,"" Sergio Baffoni, a campaigner at the global Environmental Paper Network, said in a statement . ""Industry lobbyists are celebrating, but consumers will continue to be hounded by increasing amounts of waste in their homes – there may be less plastic, but there will be far more paper – and far fewer forests."" Ultimately, no one aspect of the packaging waste problem can be solved without addressing the entire chain. The use of sustainable packaging materials relies on their accessibility, and the streamlining of packaging relies not just on precise calculations, but also effective delivery systems that don't necessitate excess packaging to keep items safe in transit. ""I think that's where our work really comes to the fore,"" says Rycroft. ""Where the large corporate end consumer customers can create enough of a value proposition for the delivery entities to come to the table along with the packaging manufacturers."" There, they can finally come up with a solution that's one size fits all. -- For the best of BBC.com in your inbox every Friday, sign up to The Essential List newsletter for a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news."

Sensitive technical details of the plan were erroneously published online in a document seen by the BBC. It set out potential risks of the AI, including whether the system, dubbed ""Amy101"", would understand local ""Brummie"" accents. West Midlands Police has insisted ""robust safeguards"" were in place. Based on the tech behind Amazon's popular voice assistant, Alexa, the trial explored how AI could help the force cope with increasing volumes of calls, and potentially offer new services such as responses in different languages. A document detailing the plan was mistakenly posted online by the office of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC). The document, marked ""official sensitive"" and with warnings that it was ""not to be publicly disclosed"", has since been removed. Amy101 was designed to speak or text-chat in order to deal with callers' inquiries and was expected to handle about 200 calls per day. The project, a two month proof-of-concept trial, was nationally funded. It was - the document suggested - the first such project where an AI-powered tool would speak to callers, though other forces were also exploring uses of the tech. Amy101 had the ability to prioritise vulnerable callers, by looking out for certain keywords - such as those referencing domestic violence - and ensuring they were next-in-line to be dealt with by a human call operator, the document says. Through speech or text chat it could direct calls, provide advice on issues such as reporting criminal damage, or requesting a crime update. West Midlands Police told the BBC the trial began on 19 December 2023 and had now concluded. Its director of commercial services, Peter Gillett, said - by the time the trial started - the force had already improved and was now ""one of the top-performing police forces for managing emergency and non-emergency calls"". The document - prepared for an ethical oversight committee that advises the PCC and Chief Constable - reveals the potential problems that might arise with Amy101, including whether the tech could cope with the local accent. ""Bias will naturally occur within the ""Amy"" system based on accents/localisation - for example can she understand ""Brummie"" accents? And are they treated with equal weighting to different accents in English?"" the document asks. Because Alexa is used globally - coping with a range of accents and languages - it was hoped that this type of bias had been removed. And if calls were not understood they would be transferred to the queue for a human operator. Mr Gillett said the force recognised that technologies capable of understanding ordinary language were ""not flawless"", and therefore may struggle with accents. As a result the force used a ""large-scale"" system ""to mitigate this bias"". Potential issues around safeguarding data were also flagged, including the risk calls would be used to help train the Amazon AI system, called Lex V2, behind Amy101. Some calls could include personally identifiable information. The document provides the example, ""My name is Marc and I want to report my house was broken into….."". The police can, however, opt-out of this kind of training and will do this ""where viable"", the document says. The ethics committee also had a number of questions, recorded in its minutes , about Amy101, such as the voice and ""gendered name"" of the tool. The force responded arguing ""humanisation"" was needed. It also suggested officers requested further analysis from Amazon on potential issues ""such as regional accent recognition and bias testing"". It is not clear whether the concerns raised in the document ever materialised, though police struck a positive note about the outcome of the trial: ""AI (Artificial Intelligence) does present some potential opportunities for providing a more efficient and robust service"", Mr Gillett said. Now the ""proof-of-concept"" trial is over, the force would be ""sharing the results and outcomes at a national scale"", he added. According to the document the government was also interested in the trial - it said a Home Office team was ""keeping a close eye"" on it with a view to wider uses."
business,business,Neutral,"[""the Bank of England's"", 'the Office for National Statistics', 'ONS', 'ONS', 'The Bank of England', 'The Bank of England', 'Bank', 'the Bank of England', 'Bank', 'Bank', 'EU', 'The European Central Bank']",What is the UK inflation rate and how does it affect me?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12196322,2024-05-09,0.1737603369891607,Normal,False,Air pollution,"Prices in the UK rose by 3.2% in the year to March 2024 - the lowest rate since September 2021. However, as this is above the Bank of England's 2% target, it decided not to cut interest rates - which are used to control inflation - in May. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with vinyl records and air fryers added in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS looks at price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure used is called the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) . One reason CPI fell to 3.2% in March was due to a drop in price for food items like meat, crumpets and chocolate biscuits. The Bank of England also considers something called ""core inflation"" when making decisions about interest rates. This excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - which can change often - to provide a comprehensive picture of price rises. Core inflation was 4.7% in March. Soaring food and energy bills were the main causes of the UK's recent high inflation. Oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine, cutting global supplies. The conflict also reduced the amount of grain for sale, pushing up food prices. Inflation hit 11.1% in October 2022, the highest rate for 40 years. The rate has fallen significantly since then, but that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. One reason that inflation has remained high is that worker shortages have made it more expensive to find and keep staff . The Bank of England target is to keep inflation at 2%. With inflation well above that level, the Bank increased interest rates to 5.25%. The theory is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. They may also choose to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it's a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. In May, the Bank of England held rates at 5.25% for a sixth time . Governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank needed to ""see more evidence"" that price rises have slowed but that he was ""optimistic that things are moving in the right direction"". He said the Bank expected inflation would fall ""close"" to its 2% target in the next couple of months. Wage growth is growing faster than rising prices, official figures show , but pay is not increasing as quickly as it was. Pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 6% in the first three months of 2024, compared with the same period a year before. After taking inflation into account, it means pay went up by 1.9%. Many other countries have also seen inflation and higher interest rates. But even at 3.2%, UK inflation remains higher than in the EU. The annual inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.4% in March, down from 2.6% in February. The European Central Bank raised its key interest rate to a record high 4% in September and has left it there. In the US, inflation hit 3.5% in March and the US central bank kept its key interest rate at between 5.25% and 5.5%. ."

They demand that the government scrap plans to introduce a controversial bill - dubbed the ""foreign agent"" law - many say is inspired by authoritarian legislation neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. On 17 April, parliament passed the bill in its first reading - the first of three barriers it must overcome before becoming law. ""I am here for my European future,"" says 23-year old Gvantsa ""Pertso"" as she sits with her friends next to the Georgian parliament, a meeting point for rallies. She is among members of Georgia's Gen Z who have been marching through Tbilisi with EU and Georgian flags draped around their shoulders, holding banners and chanting: ""No to the Russian law!"" Under the bill proposed by the ruling Georgian Dream party - which has been in power for the last 12 years - NGOs and independent media that receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors would have to register as organisations ""bearing the interests of a foreign power"". They would also be monitored by the Justice Ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 GEL ($9,400; £7,500). Because NGOs and civil society organisations in Georgia are involved in election monitoring, protesters are also concerned the bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of the parliamentary elections later this year. Parallels have been drawn with an authoritarian bill which came into force in Russia in 2012, and which the Russian government has since used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups. Many are also worried that such a law will derail Georgia from its path towards the much-coveted EU membership which - as a poll by the US National Democratic Institute showed - is supported by nearly 80% of Georgians. Georgia was granted EU candidate status in December 2023 - but now both Brussels and Washington have said the adoption of the foreign agents law would be detrimental to Georgia's European ambitions. A number of European leaders have warned the proposed bill is ""incompatible"" with European norms and values, including European Council President Charles Michel, who said the law would ""bring Georgia further away from the EU and not closer"". But Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is standing firm. He has accused NGOs of attempting to stage revolutions in Georgia twice, of promoting ""gay propaganda"" and of attacking the Georgian Orthodox Church. He and his government insist the bill is about ensuring transparency, and rejects the notion that it is against European values - or that Russia is behind the legislation. In fact, Georgian Dream has sought to distance itself from Russia over the bill, flatly rejecting any perceived similarity with the Russian law as ""disinformation"" and denouncing Russian messaging about the protests in Georgia as inflammatory. Tamar Oniani, a representative of the Georgian Young Lawyers Association NGO, is sceptical. She has been protesting against the bill, which she says is about ""suppressing civil society"" and ""in the interest of Russia."" ""That's why we are here,"" she tells the BBC from the sidelines of a protest. ""We think that it is an issue of foreign policy for Georgia, because it would shift us from EU to Russia."" Anna Dolidze, of the opposition party For The People, says that the law is a Russian ""test of allegiance"" for the Georgian Dream party, whose task is to ""pass this law and remain softly authoritarian… through the indirect silencing of critics."" Referring to similar legislation passed in neighbouring Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan, Ms Dolidze says: ""Countries that are pro-Russian in the so-called Russian neighbourhood have been asked to pass this law… as a way to create a divide between them and Europe."" In Kyrgyzstan, the Open Society Foundations NGO has recently said it would end its operations after three decades in the country following the introduction of a foreign agents bill. The new law risks ""an overwhelmingly negative impact on civil society, human rights defenders, and the media in Kyrgyzstan,"" the NGO said in a statement. For its part, Russia has rubbished allegations of meddling. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the protests against the Georgian government's bill were provoked by foreign forces who wanted to stir up anti-Russian sentiment in the country - but denied that Russia had any connection to the legislation. Analysts disagree. Sopo Gelava, a disinformation specialist with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, says that pro-Kremlin Facebook pages have been spreading claims that the West is behind the protests and pushing the narrative that the US is ""planning a coup"" in Georgia ahead of the October parliamentary elections. ""At least five pages that I'm looking at the moment have a sponsored post claiming that there is a secret plan to overthrow the government,"" Ms Gelava says. Protesters in Tbilisi have few doubts that this is a crossroads moment, and continue taking to the streets to vent their anger towards the government. Protests have now become a daily sight in Tbilisi, and show few signs of abating. ""Nine out of ten people in the street will say that our destination is Europe,"" says student Andria Chilaidze. ""I don't know why [government officials] are doing this."" Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili, who is in a bitter dispute with the government, told the BBC that questions remained over who might be behind its renewed push to adopt the law. ""Is it in Georgia or is it beyond our borders, is it in Moscow that this decision has been taken?"" she asked. ""That is the main question about transparency that the Georgian population is asking."" Additional reporting by Sandro Gvindadze and Maka Dzneladze"

Changpeng Zhao resigned from Binance in November and pleaded guilty to violating US money laundering laws. Binance was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions. Prosecutors had sought a three-year sentence for the former Binance boss. At a sentencing hearing on Tuesday in Seattle, Judge Richard Jones said Zhao put ""Binance's growth and profits over compliance with US laws and regulations"", according to the Verge. US officials said in November that Binance and Zhao's ""wilful violations"" of its laws had threatened the US financial system and national security. ""Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ""Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform."" Commonly called ""CZ"", Zhao has a $33 billion fortune, according to Forbes magazine. Nigerian authorities are currently investigating the company, registered in the Cayman Islands, as well. Tigran Gambarayan, who is in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance, denied money laundering charges in a Nigerian court in early April.

Over 100 years have passed since John Logie Baird carried out his television experiments. Between 1923 and 1924 Baird successfully experimented with transmitting images in Hastings, East Sussex. To commemorate his work an exhibition of artistic and mechanical inventions from over 20 artists is being held at Electro Studio Projects in St Leonards. Jude Montague from Montague Armstrong has curated the exhibition with the help from guest inventor-curator Chris Simpson. Ms Montague told BBC Radio Sussex that Baird, who was born in Scotland in 1888, moved to Hastings in 1922 for the ""better weather"" as he had a history of ill-health. She said: ""While he was recuperating he had a vision to invent a ‘seeing by wireless’ television."" Baird was the first person to successfully televise images in 1923. Although they were of outlines only, he is still recognised as the inventor of the television. Montague added that Baird was a ""compulsive inventor"" who would say ""I must invent something"".

More than 60 including three children were injured in the attack, which hit an eight-storey building in a densely populated area, the city's mayor said. Three missiles had struck close to the centre of the city, officials said. The attack came hours after reports of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea. Details have yet to be confirmed, although local social media channels shared video of an apparent fire on the airfield at Dzhankoi in northern Crimea. In Chernihiv, acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said one building had suffered a direct hit from one of the Russian missiles and several floors had been damaged. The presidential office in Kyiv said another four high-rise buildings, a hospital, dozens of cars and a higher education institution were all damaged in the attack. Video from the scene showed people getting off a trolleybus and diving for cover in the city. Emergency services searched the rubble for victims and officials appealed for the public to come forward to give blood. They initially said 17 people had died but regional chief said later that another person had died and 37 others were being treated in hospital. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian strike would not have happened ""if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment"", and he repeated an appeal to Western allies to provide support. Chernihiv is only 100km (60 miles) from the Russian border. Parts of the Chernihiv region not far from the city were occupied for several weeks at the start of the 2022 invasion while Russia tried to capture Kyiv to the south. The city was under siege for more than a month. It was about 70% destroyed and hundreds of civilians were killed, the mayor said. A theatre in the city was also hit in a missile attack in August 2023 which killed seven people. In a US TV interview on Monday, the Ukrainian leader also blamed Ukraine's declining air defences for Russia's ability to destroy a key thermal power plant supplying Kyiv and other regions last week. Mr Zelensky said 11 missiles were fired at the Trypillya plant and Ukrainian forces were only able to bring down seven of them. ""Four destroyed Trypillya. Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,"" he told PBS. Germany has appealed to EU, Nato and other countries with an initiative to shore up Ukraine's air defences. The German defence ministry said it was ""aimed at activating and motivating a large number of countries to deliver something in the short term"" as a result of a ""change in the threat situation"" in Ukraine. Several European leaders have indicated that they could support such a move, and both Denmark and the Netherlands have recently announced new packages of aid. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a meeting at Nato HQ in Brussels that Europe had to continue helping Ukraine. ""It is clear that mere good words and good intentions are not enough for Ukraine,"" he said. ""Nor is financial support alone. More air defences are needed and they are needed fast."" Germany's foreign ministry said the issue would be discussed at a G7 meeting at Capri in Italy later on Wednesday. Also UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Tuesday he was hopeful that the G7 could ""coalesce"" around a plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is attending the meeting, and will appeal for more weapons. Kyiv has been waiting for months for a $60bn (£48bn) US aid package to get through Congress, but it has been held up by Republican objections. Mr Zelensky said the world had shown unity in assisting non-Nato country Israel when it came under Iranian missile attack, and he called for the same political will to be shown to Ukraine."

""I used to work for PlayStation and the last game that I worked on, just production alone cost us $220 [£176m], and then you double that for marketing, and you are in half a billion dollars for every game that you put out there, which is a bit unsustainable for most companies."" He believes that artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in keeping the soaring costs of game production down, and save video game designers vital time by automating repetitive tasks. His company, Promethean AI offers developers a set of tools to craft their own virtual worlds. Mr Maximov hopes to disrupt the way games are currently produced. ""What we're trying to do is replace that with a system that can learn directly from artists, so that artists can be the authors of their own automation."" Humans will still play a key role in the production process. AI will work hand in hand with the human and enable them to be more creative. ""We can create a vision for a game and then the artist can click a button and ask an AI to give them feedback. Then they will get examples from their library of concept art and digital ideas that are relevant to their project,"" Mr Maximov says. Sometimes the AI comes up with surprising ideas. ""I remember once we were trying to build a police station and we asked the AI to populate it, and it came back with a doughnut on every desk. ""Another time, we were building an apartment and it kept consistently putting a sock under the coffee table. We wondered if it was a bug but it turned out we had labelled it a bachelor apartment so I guess that it was logical to some extent,"" he says. Californian software firm Inworld is also employing AI to build elements of computer games. It has created an engine that allows developers to add realism to game worlds and emotional depth to characters. The firm is also working on what it calls a narrative graph, developed in partnership with Xbox, which will use AI to help create storylines. Chief executive Kylan Gibbs tells the BBC that he believes AI will allow developers to ""dream bigger than ever before"". ""The engine allows developers to add AI agents that can see, sense, and perceive the world around them, while also interacting with players and taking in-game actions. When you can imbue virtual characters with advanced cognitive capabilities, it unlocks a completely new paradigm for storytelling and gameplay,"" he says. Nick Walton is the chief executive of gaming firm Latitude.io, and he believes AI has the power to personalise the gaming experience. ""We are at the start with AI and as it advances we will see very dynamic, adaptive worlds with characters that feel alive, with story arcs where you as the hero are doing unique things and having a very unique impact on the world. ""You could play a game where you find a town that no-one else cares about and no other player has spent time in, and you can get really invested in it and develop relationships with all the characters in it,"" he tells the BBC. His firm developed AI Dungeon, a game that allows players to choose from a variety of worlds and create their own stories within it. ""It's kind of like those old text adventures where you type an action and then the game determines what happens next. ""But the key difference is that instead of having a developer pre-imagine everything they might do, the AI can dynamically decide what happens next. So any action is possible."" He said that he was surprised by the success of Dungeon, the first version of which was launched in 2019. ""It was started as a side project that I just put on the internet and within a week 100,000 people had played it,"" he says. ""I think there's just a lot of replayability because the story is different every time and you can take it in any direction. And there's this ability to have true choice which has always been a goal for many games."" More technology of business Greater reliance on AI could have a knock-on effect to the humans in the industry. The chief executive of computer games giant EA, Andrew Wilson, recently told delegates at a conference that around 60% of the game publisher's development processes could be affected by AI tools. The firm recently laid off 5% of its staff, around 670 jobs. Mr Maximov does not necessarily see AI replacing humans but rather allowing humans more ""creative dignity"", something that has been lost at some of the big games publishing houses where developers are given very repetitive tasks to do. ""There are a lot of developers that had watched Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and were inspired to go and do something great but are now spending their days placing rocks outside a castle for a year,"" he said. ""There's a lot to be said for reclaiming the true purpose and value of these jobs, giving every artist the opportunity to say 'I can now make my own game'."" Mr Gibb agrees. ""We've heard from narrative designers and developers that our platform adds greater interactivity and engagement to games, but requires deep and thoughtful inputs from humans. To create the illusion of intelligence, Inworld characters need to be given rich backstories, memories, knowledge, and goals - all designed by a writer. It's about augmenting human creativity."""

Under the deal with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the firm will also launch a plan worth up to A$20m to compensate affected passengers. Qantas' Chief Executive, Vanessa Hudson, said the move represented an important step toward ""restoring confidence in the national carrier."" The so-called ""ghost flight"" case, which was launched by the ACCC in August, claimed that in some instances Qantas had sold tickets for flights that had been cancelled for weeks. The penalty agreement between Qantas and the ACCC will now have to be approved by the Federal Court of Australia. Under the  plan, customers who bought tickets for flights that had already been cancelled for two or more days will be entitled to compensation. According to the airline, they will receive A$225 for domestic flights and A$450 for international tickets. ""When flying resumed after the Covid shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers"" said Ms Hudson, who said she had made it a priority to restore the airline's reputation when she was appointed to the job last year. She also said the company had revamped its processes and invested in technology to avoid a repeat of the problem. ""We are pleased to have secured these admissions by Qantas that it misled its customers, and its agreement that a very significant penalty is required"", ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. Qantas was facing a series of scandals and legal cases when Ms Hudson became the first woman to lead the airline. Her predecessor, Alan Joyce, led the company through the 2008 financial crisis, the pandemic and record fuel prices. However, by the time Mr Joyce stepped down in 2023, Qantas was facing growing public anger over expensive airfares, mass delays and cancellations, and its treatment of workers. "

Tuta Mail - which says it has more than ten million users worldwide - alleges that, since March, it hasn’t appeared prominently in Google searches for “encrypted email."" The company has made a complaint to the EU claiming that Google - which has its own hugely popular Gmail service - has damaged a rival business. Google has denied the accusation, insisting Tuta remains ""easily accessible"" via its search engine. In its complaint, Tuta notes that its “ranking” – how high up Google’s search results it appears - fell dramatically in March 2024 for searches such as ""secure email."" As a result, monthly visits to pages on its website have dropped by almost 90%, Tuta's formal complaint to the EU alleges. ""At the beginning of March 2024 Google suddenly stopped displaying our website for thousands of keywords,"" it wrote in the complaint. Following the change, traffic to its website only came from searches mentioning the name of its products. “Google must stop this unfair limitation of showing our website in search results immediately,” Matthias Pfau, co-founder of Tuta Mail said. Google's algorithm uses a number of factors to determine the ranking of search results. When the algorithm is updated, it can have a big impact on businesses that rely on the visits search sends to their websites. There was an update in early March, as a result of which Google warned there would be more fluctuations in rankings than usual. But it denies its updates are intended to favour any particular website, including its own. ""Search ranking updates absolutely do not aim to preference Google products, or any other particular website. The email provider in question is easily accessible globally on Search,"" Google wrote. Gmail has more than a billion users worldwide. Tuta argues that “niche” email services such as its own will not be able to grow into serious competitors if they don’t appear for common search terms. In a blog post the firm accused the company of breaching a new EU law that came into force in March, which designated some large firms, including Google, as “gatekeepers” subject to additional legal restrictions. This includes not treating their own services more favourably than rivals. “Google in its role as a gatekeeper is impacting the profits and marketability of our private email service Tuta Mail - a direct competitor to Google's Gmail, which goes against the Digital Markets Act”, the company wrote. But, according to a Google spokesperson, Tuta ranks above Gmail for a range of email-related searches, including ones that don't mention it as a brand and those it referred to in its blog."

In particular, Ukraine needs more missiles and shells to stop Russian forces making further gains on the battlefield. The aid for Ukraine is part of a $95bn (£76bn) package which also includes military support for Israel and Taiwan . The supply of US weapons to Ukraine dried up in early 2024, because a bill to grant more aid was delayed in Congress. But President Biden said the US can now start sending armaments ""right away"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the commitment ""reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and leader of the free world"". The aid package includes at least $8bn (£6.5bn) to re-supply Ukraine with missiles and ammunition . Prime minister Rishi Sunak has also confirmed the UK will provide an extra £500m on top of the £2.5bn in military aid it had already pledged to give Ukraine in 2024. This will pay for extra missiles, ammunition, armoured vehicles and all terrain vehicles . In February 2024, the EU agreed a further €50bn (£42bn; $54bn) aid package for Ukraine , after Hungary stopped blocking the deal. The EU failed to meet its target of sending one million shells to Ukraine by the beginning of March. However, the Czech Republic agreed a $1.5bn deal for a group of 18 Nato and EU countries to buy 800,000 rounds - both 155mm and 122mm calibre - from outside the EU. Between February 2022 and the end of February 2024, the US delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $46.2bn to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute, a German research organisation . Over the same period, Germany gave Ukraine weapons and equipment worth $10.7bn, the UK $5.7bn, Denmark $5.2bn, and the Netherlands $4.1bn. The US had warned that Ukraine's military is running short on munitions and morale is low. One key shortage is of air defence missiles. President Zelensky said Ukraine needs ""seven more Patriots or similar air defence systems"" to protect its cities . These would allow Ukraine to ""counter Russia's glide bombs, which [Moscow] is using to pound defensive positions and civilian targets like power stations,"" says Dr Marina Miron, of King's College London. Russia has carried out repeated air attacks on Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, which is near the Russian border. The commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said Russian forces may start to advance on the city. Ukrainian armed forces have also been limited to firing 2,000 shells a day, according to the UK-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). In contrast, Russian forces have been firing up to 10,000 shells a day, Rusi said. It said Russia gets almost three million shells a year from its own factories and from North Korea. Ukraine has lost 583 sq km (225 square miles) of territory in the east of the country to Russian forces since October 2023, largely because of a lack of artillery. It blamed shortages for the loss of the town of Avdiivka in February. The resumption of US ammunition supplies means Ukraine could start using more artillery shells from its stocks, says Justin Crump, of risk intelligence company Sibylline. ""Until now, Ukrainian forces have been rationing shell use because they haven't been able to tell when new supplies are coming,"" he says. Anti-tank weapons Western countries responded to Russia's invasion in February 2022 by giving Ukraine's armed forces defensive weapons, to counter Russia's armoured brigades. The US and UK supplied thousands of Javelin and Nlaw anti-tank missiles. These were considered crucial in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv. Air defence systems To counter Russian air superiority, and its attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, Western nations sent Ukraine several types of air defence system. These range from the UK's short-range anti-aircraft weapon, Starstreak, to the Patriot missile system. Patriots are expensive to operate - one missile costs about $3m. The US and Norway have also provided the Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) for air defence, and Germany has offered the Iris-T. Artillery and missiles After Russia's retreat from Kyiv, the war became focused on the east of the country. Artillery and missiles were heavily used by both sides. Australia, Canada, the US and others sent M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine. The US and UK also provided missile systems including Himars, and the M270 MLRS. Ukraine has also received long-range missiles such as Scalp from France, Storm Shadow from the UK and ATACMS from the US. The US has also supplied Ukraine with the longest-range version of ATACMS , which can travel 190 miles (300km). Before April 2024, it had only provided a shorter range version. In July 2023, the US said it had supplied cluster bombs to Ukraine, to help dislodge Russian troops from defensive positions. These weapons, delivered mostly in artillery shells, scatter multiple bomblets, and are banned by more than 100 countries because of the risk they pose to civilians . In early 2023, Western nations agreed to send tanks to Ukraine. It was hoped they would enable Ukraine to breach Russian defensive lines. The UK provided the Challenger 2. The US sent 31 Abrams tanks, and European nations have sent several German-made Leopard 2 tanks. The US-built M1 Abrams has been described as the most advanced tank in the world. However, none of this new armour enabled Ukraine to make a major breakthrough in its counter-offensive. Drones have featured heavily throughout the war, for surveillance, targeting, launching missiles and as ""kamikaze"" weapons. Turkey supplied missile-firing Bayraktar TB2 drones at the start of the war, the US has provided ""Switchblade"" kamikaze drones, and several countries have sent commercial surveillance drones, such as the Chinese-made DJI Mavic 3. In February 2024, the UK government said it would join a coalition of countries supplying Ukraine with thousands of ""first person view"" drones , for observation and target spotting. Ukraine has consistently asked the US for fighter jets, to counter Russia's air superiority. In May 2023, President Joe Biden agreed to let other nations supply it with US-made F-16s. Denmark and the Netherlands offered to donate planes. Ukrainian pilots have been learning how to fly them in 11 Western countries."

Peter Hebblethwaite also revealed that he earned more than £500,000 last year, including a bonus. At a hearing over workers' rights and protection, Mr Hebblethwaite faced more questions over P&O's decision to axe hundreds of workers without notice and replace them with agency staff. He said he was deeply sorry for the redundancies and claimed ""we would not make that decision again"". In 2022, P&O Ferries, known for its Dover to Calais route, gained notoriety when it made 786 staff redundant before replacing them with people on lower wages . The move led to a public outcry and prompted the government to create legislation aimed at preventing similar mass sacking happening in the future. On Tuesday, Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs that the agency workers P&O now uses to crew its boats can be paid as little as £4.87 a hour- that includes overtime and bonuses. On average, P&O workers make £5.20 an hour. The chief executive said crew is paid in excess of the minimum basic wage set out by international law. “We are paying considerably ahead of the international standard,"" he said. But Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Committee, accused Mr Hebblethwaite of ""robbing your staff blind"". The chief executive was also asked whether he felt like ""a modern day pirate"" by the committee chair. In the UK, the minimum wage rose to £11.44 an hour in April but many crew members who work for P&O Ferries are recruited by an external agency from overseas, including from India and the Philippines. Mr Hebblethwaite said: ""We are paying considerably ahead of the international minimum standard. ""We believe that it is right that as an international business operating in international waters, we should be governed by international law."" ""In British waters when the law changes we’ll pay national minimum wage. We already pay national minimum wage on domestic routes,"" Mr Hebblethwaite added. “It’s a minimum wage for UK workers, we recruit from an international field and operate in international waters.” Labour MP Andy McDonald responded saying he understood the point he P&O Ferries boss was making, but added: ""It just appears to this committee that you’re getting away with what amounts to modern day slavery.” Mr Hebblethwaite said that he “categorically” resisted the claim. Concerns for P&O staff jobs amid new crew law How much is the minimum wage going up? Sacked P&O worker disappointed in government The P&O boss was asked if he could live on £4.87 an hour. ""No, I couldn't,"" he replied. He also admitted that last year he was paid a salary of £325,000 and received a bonus of £183,000 last April. Mr Hebblethwaite said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the impact the sackings had on the 786 seafarers and their families. “Let me be absolutely clear, we would not make that decision again,"" he told MPs. But he also said the decision had been necessary to save the company. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said Mr Hebblethwaite ""admitted that he couldn’t live on this poverty rate of pay – but he expects his workers to survive on it"". He added: “It beggars belief that P&O Ferries has faced no sanctions for its misdeeds and that its parent company DP World has continued to be awarded government contracts."" The government revealed plans in 2022 to reform maritime law to prevent future mass sackings without notice, saying it would close ""loophole in the law"" it believed had been ""exploited"" by P&O Ferries. It now expects new legislation to address the issue to come into effect this summer. France now has a similar law coming into force in three months. If the new UK legislation is put in place, ferry operators will have to pay the £11.44 an hour minimum wage to staff."

Her victory came hours after thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors gathered in the streets of Malmö, Sweden, where the contest is being held, to show their support for Gaza. A night before, the 20-year-old singer had been booed during dress rehearsals. There was a mixture of cheering and booing again during Thursday's semi-final. Speaking after the show, she said she was ""overwhelmed with emotions"". ""It is truly such an honour to be here on stage, representing [Israel] with pride,"" she said. ""I’m so grateful for everyone who voted and took part in supporting us, and me.""   The 10 acts who succeeded in Thursday's public vote were: Which means the six countries eliminated were Malta, Albania, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark and San Marino. Israel's participation in Eurovision has been a source of controversy amid rising civilian deaths and a worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, as the war between Israel and Hamas enters its seventh month. Smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off in Malmö’s central square on Thursday afternoon, along with chants of ""Free Palestine"". A smaller demonstration in support of Israel also took place. Although the protests were largely peaceful, there are armed police outside the hotel where Golan is staying, and she has been confined to her room when she is not on stage.  After receiving a hostile reception at dress rehearsals, the singer said ""nothing will deter"" her from taking part in the contest. And ahead of the semi-final, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent Golan a message of support via social media . ""Eden, I want to wish you success,"" he said in Hebrew. ""You know what? You've already succeeded - because you are not only competing in Eurovision in a proud and very impressive way, you are successfully facing an ugly wave of antisemitism - and you are standing up to it and representing the State of Israel with great honour. ""So what a blessing, and know that when people yell 'boo' at you, we shout 'hooray'"".  According to bookmakers, Golan's song is fifth favourite to win the contest on Saturday night. Topping the odds is Croatian act Baby Lasagna, whose riotous dance anthem Rim Tim Tagi Dim qualified from the first semi-final on Tuesday. Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic pop song The Code is the second favourite, was one of the 10 acts who were voted through after Thursday's show. The singer put on one of the night's most impressively athletic performances, dancing on a rotating turntable while they sang about coming to terms with their non-binary identity Other artists who qualified included Austria's Kaleen, with her techno anthem We Will Rave, and Armenia's Ladaniva, whose sassy and exuberant song, Jako, brought a Balkan folk flavour to the contest. Greek singer Marina Zatti also made it through, despite suffering pharyngitis and a fever in the run-up to her performance. Meanwhile, Latvia and Georgia broke an eight-year losing streak - sending their contestants to the final for the first time since 2016. The second semi-final also saw performances from former Eurovision winners Helena Paparizou, Charlotte Perelli and Sertab Erener - who led the crowd in a singalong medley of their winning entries during the interval. Host Petra Mede also sang a tongue-in-cheek number that boasted about Sweden's seven Eurovision victories. The sequence also featured a reprise performance from last year's runner-up, Käärijä, in all his tongue-waggling glory.

Perry shared two fake images of her on Instagram with the caption ""couldn't make it to the MET, had to work"". One image of the singer in a floral gown with a moss trim has been viewed over 13 million times on X. The picture was first posted at the start of the red carpet event at the Museum of Modern Art in New York with the caption: ""Katy Perry. That's it."" Fans replied to Perry's Instagram post admitting they had been fooled by the picture. ""I really reposted this believing it was true,"" one fan said, while another wrote ""Wait, it's AI-generated?! I got fooled."" The Fireworks singer also shared a screenshot of a conversation with her mum who was also fooled by the image. ""lol mom the AI got you too, BEWARE!"" Perry said in a message. Another AI image of the singer, this time wearing a gold corseted gown with a key breastplate on the red carpet, has also been going viral with over 5 million views. The dress was fitting with the 2024 theme, The Garden of Time - a short story about a Count and Countess who pluck time-reversing flowers. Marianna Spring, Disinformation and Social Media Correspondent Why does this matter? After all - this is the red carpet not an election. Well, it tells us how AI-generated content is becoming ever more convincing. They even managed to trick Katy Perry's own mum. The tell-tale signs are still there; a photographer missing half of his head, dodgy fingers on another - and the carpet itself is from 2018. But it still feels like an improvement on some of the other AI-generated images that have gone viral. And this can all  get a lot more serious. Over the past few months, I've investigated how AI-generated images of former US President Donald Trump with black voters - some satirical, others not - have been created and shared by supporters ahead of the election. And how faked AI-generated audio of London's Mayor - which sounded like a secret recording - fanned the flames of rest offline. It falsely suggested he was moving Remembrance Day ceremonies to accommodate a pro-Palestinian march. These tactics will be at play on our social media feeds in the coming months - so this is a reminder to put our social media sleuthing to the test. An AI-generated image of Rihanna has also had millions of views on social media. The picture shows her on the red carpet wearing an embroidered gown complete with fauna, birds and an enormous circular armpiece. According to People , the 36-year-old was unable to make the event after coming down with the flu. At the beginning of the night, fake photos of Dua Lipa were circulating showing her in an off-shoulder corseted gown with a fringe and bow. It showed her at a different location to the carpet. A few hours later, the 28-year-old British-Albanian singer later turned up to the event in an entirely different outfit - a lacy all-black dress with bedazzled belly chains, mesh polka-dot gloves and a massive black feather boa over her shoulder. The annual charity event draws A-list celebrities and the who's who of the fashion world and this year Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Bad Bunny joined Vogue's Anna Wintour as hosts. The event raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and tickets are rumoured to cost upwards of $70,000 (£56,000)"
politics,politics,Negative,"['the US House of Representatives', 'Pentagon', 'Congress', 'House', 'the US Senate', 'House', 'House', 'House', 'House', 'Congress', 'House', 'White House', 'House']",US Speaker Mike Johnson may pay political price for Ukraine deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68866912,2024-04-20,0.12941381358011772,Scandal,False,Methane release,"After months of delay and increasingly dire warnings, the US House of Representatives approved $61bn in new aid to Ukraine by a comfortable margin. The passage is a big win for Ukraine, which has been desperate for new military supplies to stave off a Russian offensive that is gaining ground. The US Pentagon press secretary told reports on Thursday that US military supplies, including for air defence systems and artillery units, could be moved to Ukraine in a matter of days after final approval. Saturday's rare moment of co-operation in Congress is also a cause for celebration for President Joe Biden, who has been calling the Ukraine war a world-defining conflict that the US cannot afford to shrug off. ""Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage,"" he said. The president could sign the aid into law later this week, as the US Senate is expected to approve the House foreign aid package - which also includes funding for Israel and Taiwan - as early as Tuesday. Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also has reason to be encouraged by the result. It was his change of heart on Ukraine support, from a reticence to active support, that proved the decisive factor in getting the foreign aid package approved. He received a vote of confidence from Donald Trump just a week ago, and the former president - who has spoken out against more support for Ukraine in the past - could have caused untold headaches for Mr Johnson as aid moved through the House. Instead, he largely stayed silent, focused instead on his ongoing trial in New York City. Mr Johnson may still pay a political price for Saturday's achievement, however. He relied heavily on Democratic support not just on the final votes but to clear procedural hurdles leading up to those votes. His decision to turn to Democrats was necessitated by intense resistance among a handful of Republicans, some in key positions of power in the House, who opposed any new aid to Ukraine. Now those Republicans may force a vote on whether to oust Mr Johnson from the speaker's chair. In remarks to the press after passage of the foreign aid bill, Mr Johnson defended his actions and said he was not walking around the halls of Congress worrying about being removed from power. ""I've done here what I believe to be the right thing,"" he said. While a move to trigger his ouster did not come on Saturday, three Republicans have come forward to call for Mr Johnson's removal - and they say more will join them in the coming days, as the House breaks for a week-long recess. ""I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents,"" Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who drafted a resolution to remove Mr Johnson weeks ago, said after the foreign aid package was approved. Public opinion polls have shown many Republican voters souring on additional aid to Ukraine, even as Democrats and independents support American help in the war effort. If a removal vote does come, some Democrats have expressed a willingness to back the speaker - essentially rewarding him for standing up to members of his own party to ensure Ukraine aid, a high priority for Democrats and the Biden White House, cleared the House. That could give Mr Johnson a short-term lease on political power, but it is difficult to imagine how a Republican speaker can reliably count on ongoing Democratic support. While there was overwhelming bipartisan backing for this foreign aid package, at some point Mr Johnson will push legislation on an issue that angers Democrats. If his Republican critics make another move then, he may find his former allies across the aisle are much less willing to throw him a lifeline. For now, however, Mr Johnson can savour a hard-fought victory. His strategy - to break the aid package into individual components on Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and to face down his Republican opponents who openly defied him - worked largely as planned. In his remarks after the votes, he said the legislation was not perfect, and that it was not a ""blank cheque"" - a reflection that recent months have shown there are clear and growing limits to US support. He said new aid must be monitored to ensure that it is being spent wisely and Ukraine must find an ""endgame strategy"" for the war. But he stood by the path he took to arrive at Saturday's result. ""I've said before, you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may,"" Mr Johnson said. For a legislator who languished in relatively obscurity until a leadership crisis last October pushed him into the spotlight, it is a historic achievement. But the coming weeks will determine whether it will also be his political epitaph."

Meta, Apple, and Alphabet, which owns Google, are being looked into for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduced in 2022. If they are found to have broken the rules, the firms can face huge fines of up to 10% of their annual turnover. EU antitrust boss Margrethe Vestager and industry head Thierry Breton announced the investigations on Monday. Just six companies have obligations under the DMA, but they are also the world's largest tech firms: Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and ByteDance. None of the firms are actually based in Europe - five of them are in the US, while ByteDance has headquarters in Beijing. Three of them are now facing questions just two weeks after submitting their compliance reports, which will have been meticulously compiled. It comes three weeks after the EU fined Apple €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking competition laws over music streaming. Meanwhile, the United States accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market in a landmark lawsuit against the tech giant introduced last week . An Apple spokesperson says the company will constructively engage with the investigation and that they're confident that their plan complies with the Digital Markets Act. They added that their teams established a variety of mechanisms to comply with the EU's landmark legislation, as well as privacy and security protections for EU users. ""Throughout, we've demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to the European Commission and developers, listening and incorporating their feedback,"" they said. Meanwhile a Meta spokesperson said the firm's use of subscriptions as an alternative to advertising were ""a well-established business model across many industries"". ""We designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA... we will continue to engage constructively with the Commission,"" they said. Alphabet has been approached for comment. The EU said it will investigate five different possible acts of non-compliance in its announcement: The first two of these investigations concern what is known as ""anti-steering"" - and the EU says it believes the firms are making it difficult for apps to tell users about ways to pay less for their services outside of using app stores' own payment methods. Under the third point, the EU says that Apple is obliged to allow users to easily uninstall apps on their devices, change default settings and be given ""choice screens"" to let them use different browsers or search engines. The EU says Apple's web browser ""choice screen"" does not give people enough choice, and said that some apps, such as Apple Photos, cannot be deleted at all. According to Ms Vestager, the investigation will take around 12 months to complete - though Mr Breton later clarified it could take slightly longer. ""We suspect that the suggested solutions put forward by the three companies do not fully comply with the DMA,"" she said. ""We will now investigate the companies' compliance with the DMA, to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe."" The five cases are consumer-focused, and highly relatable to most people who use products from these companies, which is collectively billions of people worldwide. ""We're talking about the protection of our citizens, we can't just sit around and wait,"" said Thierry Breton, of the EU's decision to act straight away. There is however another reason potentially in mind: European Parliament elections are due to be held in June 2024. Dr Rupprecht Podszun, director of the Institute for Competition Law at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, called it ""a strong signal"" from the EU. ""The DMA is designed for quick results,"" he said. ""The cases that the Commission has selected go to the heart of the business models; these are not marginal issues for the gatekeepers. ""The legal battles will be tense, but we must always bear in mind that the Court of Justice will have the last word."""

Getting ever more desperate, the fictional British TV presenter suggests shows such as Inner City Sumo, Youth Hostelling With Chris Eubanks, and finally, Monkey Tennis. All were perhaps unsurprisingly rejected. Maybe Partridge, played by comedian and actor Steve Coogan, would have had better luck if he had let an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system pick the ideas. That may initially sound like a highly fanciful idea, but a number of TV production companies have already announced that they are using AI to help them dream up new programmes. These include RTL Group, whose subsidiaries make everything from The X Factor, to The Apprentice, Grand Designs and QI. It said last year that it had ""started to support content creation with generative AI."" Meanwhile, Banijay, which makes Deal or No Deal and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, now has a fund to back AI-created content. Announcing this last year, it said: ""While human creativity will always prevail, it's important to work alongside the tools which are available to contribute to the future of ground-breaking entertainment."" While neither firm has yet to unveil a new TV series whose idea came from an AI system, I decided to put one to the test. So I logged into an AI chatbot, and typed in what I was looking for. I wrote: ""I am trying to think up a new TV format. A series with contestants. ""Maybe they would be learning a new skill, like dancing, or perhaps they are trying to compete in communities to have the most sustainable environment. Can you help me with some ideas?"" The AI confirms that this could be an exciting endeavour. And instantly comes up with six ideas. I like its first suggestion - Skills Mastery Showdown - where contestants would be paired with skilled mentors, and have a limited time to master a specific new skill, such as dancing, cooking or painting. But what do TV industry experts think about the use of AI in coming up with future content? I ask Dan Whitehead, who is a senior consultant at K7 Media, a Manchester-based research firm that reports on the TV business. ""The idea of a machine that you can type a request into, in normal conversational language, and have it spit out something close to what you asked for, still feels pretty magical,"" he says. ""So it's understandable that people are drawn to it. ""Can something like [AI chatbot] ChatGPT generate ideas for a TV show? Of course, but then ideas for TV shows have never been in short supply. The big problem for most production companies is the uncertainty - which ideas are best, which ones are worth investing in?"" Mr Whitehead argues that AI can give people false confidence, giving them the sense that if it - with access to billions of data points - can come up with these ideas, they must somehow be better. I look back at Skills Mastery Showdown. Maybe it's not that innovative after all.  Mr Whitehead says that AI is better used in a much more nuanced, background way. ""The BBC's Springwatch and Winterwatch use a bespoke AI system that monitors live camera feeds, and has been trained to recognise, record and log different species of animals and birds as they appear in the frame,"" he says. ""It can then tell the production team how often they appear, give behavioural insights, and generally do something that would eat up hours of human production time."" Eline van Der Velden, founder and chief executive of London-based TV production firm Particle 6, is more positive about using AI to both help come up with ideas for new programmes, and to write scripts. She says that recently she had two versions of a script ready for a client, one edited by humans, and the other by Chat GPT. ""We gave them both versions, and they preferred the ChatGPT one,"" she says. Ms van Der Velden adds that she wants her producers to know how to use AI to help them do their job. ""[Otherwise] it's like having someone who doesn't know how Microsoft Word works,"" she says. ""It speeds everything up."" She also says that AI isn't replacing jobs in TV, or at least not all of them. ""It's like when accountants thought they'd be out of work with the advent of Excel. ""You still need a creative director, but this is a tool that programme makers should use. It will enable us to reach the next level of our full potential."" Read more stories on artificial intelligence I still want to see if AI can help me make a hit TV programme? What about a drama series instead? Mr Whitehead reminds me that AI is not human, that it will never have an emotional response to any requests or prompts that I give it. Undeterred, I asked my AI chatbot for ideas for a new TV show about the Post Office scandal. It comes back with a six-part series called ""Broken Trust"", which will combine drama and documentary elements to ""engage viewers emotionally, while providing factual insights into the larger issues at play. Mr Whitehead is not impressed, describing it as ""about as generic a description of a programme on this subject as I can imagine"". He adds that ITV's hit show on the topic - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - could not have been dreamed up by AI. ""That needed human beings to see the human story, to trust that there was interest in that story,"" says Mr Whitehead. ""No algorithm would ever have predicted that as one of the biggest shows of Christmas 2023, yet here we are. ""In fact most of the big hit shows - scripted and unscripted - came about because someone took a punt on a leftfield idea or unlikely combination of ideas that nobody was sure would work. I don't think AI will ever replicate that essential random spark."" However, Ms van Der Velden thinks it soon will. ""AI helps us with scripts, topics for children's shows... The only thing it hasn't done yet, is come up with a great TV format - something like the Traitors. But it will. Just give it six months."""

In an open letter also signed by Katy Perry and the estate of Frank Sinatra, they warn AI ""will set in motion a race to the bottom"" if left unchecked. Tech giants including YouTube have tested AI music-making tools . ""We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal artists' voices and likenesses,"" they said. They have called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"". In an open letter organised by campaign group the Artists' Rights Alliance and posted on long-form writing site Medium , the artists say AI will ""infringe upon our rights and devalue the rights of human artists"" if it is used irresponsibly. They said the way that artists' work is used to train some AI models and systems was ""an assault on human creativity"", and warned it was being used to ""violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem"". Tom Kiehl, interim head of industry association UK Music, said he shared the concerns of artists who worry their work is being used to train AI without their permission. ""This amounts to music laundering and any companies engaged in these practices must stop and take a more responsible approach to our music industry,"" he said. ""Ensuring artists have given their consent and receive appropriate credit and compensation for the use of their work on AI systems must be the foundation to a more responsible approach."" Artists spanning creative disciplines and genres have spoken out about how AI is used in recent months, after a song which used AI to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral online. Drake voiced disapproval over the song which sounded a lot like him - but was in fact generated using AI voice cloning tools - and appeared on Spotify and Apple Music before being abruptly pulled down . Other artists have since spoken out about it, with Sting telling the BBC he believes musicians face ""a battle"" to defend their work against the rise of songs written by AI. ""The building blocks of music belong to us, to human beings,"" he said. But not all musicians oppose developments in or use of AI across the music industry, and electronic artist Grimes and DJ David Guetta are among those backing the use of such AI tools. Grimes has even encouraged fans and budding musicians to use her voice ""without penalty"" and said she would split royalties on successful AI-generated tracks using her voice . The BBC has approached Google, which owns YouTube, for comment."

Prices last month were up 1.1% from the same point last year, following a 0.4% annual rise seen in March. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said the housing market was ""finding its feet in an era of higher interest rates"". ""While borrowing costs remain more expensive than a few years ago, homebuyers are gaining confidence from a period of relative stability,"" she added, with activity and demand improving. “However, we can’t overlook the fact that affordability constraints are still a significant challenge, for both new buyers and those rolling off fixed-term deals,"" Ms Brydon said. ""Mortgage rates have edged up again in recent weeks, primarily as a result of expectations around future Bank of England base rate changes, with markets now pricing in a slower pace of cuts."" First-time buyers and homeowners looking to remortgage are still facing a ""significant challenge"" when it comes to finding affordable deals, the Halifax has said. The lender said house prices have been largely flat so far this year, and only saw a small increase in April. Mortgage rates have been rising in recent weeks, mainly due to expectations that the Bank of England will make fewer interest rate cuts this year. However, a forecast from estate agent Savills suggests that house prices will rise by more than a fifth by the end of 2028. Savills said it had upgraded its forecast for the next few years on expectations of a stronger performance from the UK economy together with steady cuts to interest rates. The Bank's latest decision on interest rates will be announced on Thursday, with most analysts predicting they will be left unchanged at 5.25%. At the start of the year, many analysts had expected the Bank to make several cuts to its key interest rate in 2024, with the first predicted to take place in June. But with inflation - the rate at which prices rise - not falling as fast as expected, forecasts of when the Bank will cut have been pushed back. This change in expectations has had a knock-on effect on the mortgage market, pushing rates back up. Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The lender said Northern Ireland saw the biggest rise among the nations and regions, with prices up 3.4% from a year earlier. Within England, the North West recorded the biggest rise, up 3.3%, while price falls were mainly in the south of England, the Halifax said. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said while house prices appeared to have stabilised, ""look a little closer at the annual figures and the market is wonky – with the north/south divide seeing prices climb in the north and drop steadily in the south"". She added this was due to mortgage rates remaining ""stubbornly high"" and creeping upwards. The average two-year fixed rate mortgage is currently at 5.93%, up from around  5.8% at the end of March. ""It’s not a dramatic move, but it’s in the wrong direction, and it’s coming at a time when homeowners expected mortgage rates to be dropping."" With homes in the south of England tending to be pricier, higher mortgage costs have had a bigger impact in the region. ""As a result, demand is down, and property prices are level or falling,"" said Ms Coles.  Halifax said that it still expected property prices to ""rise modestly"" in 2024, if interest rates are cut later this year. Savills is predicting house prices will grow by 2.5% this year, an upgrade from the 3% fall it was forecasting in November last year. By the end of 2028, the estate agent expects values to have risen by 21.6% on average, up from its previous outlook of 17.9%. The new forecast would mean the average house price rising by £61,500 between 2023 and 2028 to £346,500. ""Improving economic performance, combined with steady cuts to the base rate, will open up greater capacity for growth from 2025,"" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. Savills used data from Oxford Economics and Nationwide, and its forecasts apply to average prices in the second-hand market only, so do not include new-build properties. Read more here"

Posting on X, the 32-year-old Fortnite gamer - who has 19m followers on Twitch - said a mole removed from his foot was found to be cancerous. Ninja said a second dark spot on his foot was also being checked, and though ""shocked"" he was ""grateful to have hope"" that the cancer was found early. He is urging others to get regular check-ups. Ninja has become synonymous with Twitch since his return to the streaming site in 2020, following a brief stint with Microsoft's rival platform Mixer - which was shutdown in June that year. Such is his popularity on Fortnite that players can pay to make their characters look like him. His status as one of the most recognisable names in streaming has also led to him appearing on mainstream programmes, such as The Masked Singer US. In his post on X , Ninja said he found out about the cancer after visiting a dermatologist for an annual check-up of his moles. ""There was a mole on the bottom of my foot that they wanted to remove just to be careful,"" he said. ""It came back as melanoma, but they are optimistic that we caught it in the early stages."" According to the NHS website , melanoma is a form of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, and is typically caused by ultraviolet light from the sun.

One moment it is all about unprecedented missile and drone attacks between Iran and Israel. The next the headlines return to the fighting and suffering in Gaza. But policymakers, analysts and military leaders are still absorbing the extraordinary exchange of fire just days ago between two old adversaries, one that arguably came a small technological failure away from triggering a devastating international conflict. It is worth considering how close they came to the edge and how deep the abyss that lay before them. This was the first time Iran and Israel had attacked each other directly. Some analysts say the Iranian attack was the largest combined missile and drone assault ever - bigger than anything Russia has levelled against Ukraine. It was certainly the first external bombardment of Israel since Saddam Hussein's Scud missiles in 1991. Most of the 300-plus Iranian drones and missiles were shot down or failed en route. But I watched from our office in Jerusalem as the night sky was lit up by Israeli air defences trying to bring down the ballistic missiles flying overhead. All it would have taken is for one GPS guidance system to fail for a missile to land in an urban area at huge civilian cost. ""I don't think people realise how close we were that weekend,"" one senior Western security official told me. ""It could have been a very different story."" Yet some in the West think positives can be drawn from the attack on 13 April and Israel's limited retaliation last week. They argue it was a huge intelligence success to predict the Iranian strike, that the defence of Israel was an outstanding example of allied military cooperation, and that both Iran and Israel learned how to climb down the escalatory ladder. Let's take the intelligence operation first. I am told the US learned about Iran's plans on the Wednesday morning before the attack on Saturday evening. And crucially, they discovered the scale of Iran's ambition. ""We got wind that Iran's response would be at the top end of expectations,"" said one high-level Western source. ""And that was a bit of a shock. But it helped galvanise the international response."" Crucially, it helped the US persuade some countries in the Gulf to join in Israel's defence, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Their fear - once they were aware of the scale of Iran's plans - was the risk of an escalatory regional war if Israel had no choice but to retaliate hard. So a mixture of good intelligence gathering and private Iranian signalling (which the US denies took place) gave Israel and its allies time to prepare. The roles played by Jordan and Saudi Arabia are still not fully clear. Jordan has admitted shooting down Iranian drones in self-defence to protect its sovereignty. It is understood Jordan also allowed Israeli warplanes some access to its airspace. The Saudis are thought to have provided information to the US and kept an eye on any threat from Iranian-backed armed groups in Yemen. The key point is it worked. The US, British, French, Jordanian and Saudi militaries showed they could operate together on collective air defence. ""It was an extraordinarily successful tactical operation,"" said the security source. ""The intelligence cued it up, we had sight of the whole area and we worked together. No other group of nations can do that in the world."" Some have also argued this could be the start of a new regional alliance against Iran. To others, though, that is a typical security and military perspective, one that celebrates technological success while missing the bigger political picture. The more pessimistic analysts argue that if Iran wanted to inflict significant damage on Israel, it could have refrained from giving advance warning, broadened its targets, launched a second wave of attacks - or even ordered Hezbollah to mount a large attack from Lebanon. Emile Hokayem from the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank said the operation revealed how much Israel had to rely on allies for its defence. He also wondered whether Israel would have enough air defence missiles needed for a higher intensity conflict. ""As we've seen in the war between Ukraine and Russia, it matters how much of the good stuff you have in stock,"" he said. Mr Hokayem also dismissed the idea this crisis marked the beginning of a new regional military alliance. ""We're not at the cusp of a new era,"" he said. ""Arab states have cooperated because primarily they want to avoid a regional confrontation. And they want to demonstrate they're good partners to their western allies. It's also simply a matter of national sovereignty. They don't want stuff flying and exploding in their skies."" The second claim by optimists is that Iran and Israel have learned from this experience. They say both countries - for once - communicated their intentions accurately; they realised they could de-escalate without losing face; and they both had a scare that will re-establish mutual deterrence. Iran may have attacked Israel but it warned allies of its intent and signalled early it was a one-off. Israel showed it could retaliate modestly, targeting air defences in central Iran and using a small attack to signal a bigger capability, namely that it could hit Iran where and when it wanted. I am told Iran may even have been tipped off about Israel's retaliation. Certainly Iran signalled from a very early stage it did not intend to respond to Israel's counter-attack. Both sides certainly will have learned military lessons. ""The attack probably helped Iran identify the relative strengths and the weaknesses of the Israeli air defence system,"" said the Institute for the Study of War. Israel and the US will also have a greater understanding of Iran's tactical strategies. The counter-argument is that both Iran and Israel broke a taboo, that direct attack is now an easier option. In an essay for Foreign Affairs, Afshon Ostovar from the Foreign Policy Research Institute says the scale of Iran's attack shows it is no longer convinced by a policy of restraint. ""The notion that Iran intentionally launched a weak attack does not stand up to scrutiny,"" he writes. ""Iran hoped to land an impressive blow against Israel."" Mr Hokayem challenges the idea Iran and Israel have learned to understand each other. He cites Israel's failure to realise the consequences of its decision to kill several elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commanders in Iran's consulate in Damascus. ""These two countries don't talk to each other. Instead, they just signal through military posturing and third parties. These things can go badly quite quickly. Wrongly reading the other side's intentions - or risk appetite - is a feature rather than a bug in the relationship."" There is also scepticism either side have re-established deterrence. Amos Harel, defence analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said: ""The two countries breached the previous rules of the game, with limited costs… the balance of deterrence between the two countries (is) unsettled."" Perhaps the key lesson learned by many in this crisis was just how close the region had come to full scale war. ""It was just a huge relief,"" one Western diplomat told me. ""It could have gone so differently."""

Specifically, this line: “It’s barbaric, but hey! It’s home.” She’s telling the group about Edward Said, and how his work looking at the way Middle Eastern cultures had been depicted in the West could be applied even to Disney films. The talk then turns to how Said's theories could be applied to the portrayal of Palestinians in Western media. While this scene doesn't sound out of the ordinary, this isn’t your usual university seminar. This lecturer was giving her talk in the middle of an encampment, which university students set up on Wednesday to protest against the war in Gaza. Here in Newcastle, about 40 students have set up camp on the university’s quadrangle, with tents for sleeping, a makeshift first-aid centre, and tables for all the snacks donated by supporters - including crisps, water, and a Colin the Caterpillar cake. Students themselves do coursework or exam revision on the grass, or slip off for seminars and lectures, as they would if it were student halls. Several staff members come in to show their support and drop off donations of snacks. All of those I speak to tell me they feel “proud” to see their students taking part. Running along the perimeter are hand-painted signs. Naomi, who’s asked that we don’t use her full name, shows me a sign that she’d painted the night before. “It says ‘Tzedek, Tzedek, Tirdof’,” she tells me. “It means ‘justice, justice, shall you seek’.” Naomi says the sign - written in Hebrew - reflects how her Jewish faith has shaped her view of the conflict in Gaza. “I was always raised with a very strong sense of justice, because of my Jewish community,” she explains, adding that the sign “encompasses so much of what my Judaism means to me”. “In many ways, if I hadn’t been Jewish, I wouldn’t feel so firmly in solidarity with Palestine, because of the sense of social justice that my faith gives me.” Newcastle students are just one of many student bodies across the country to set up similar occupied protests this week . Similar outdoor camps have been erected on campuses including at Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield, while a camp outside Warwick University has been in place for 10 days. At Goldsmiths, University of London, students have occupied the library, inside the university building. Earlier this week the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) released a statement saying campus protests in support of Gaza were creating a “hostile and toxic atmosphere for Jewish students”. Guy Dabby-Joory, from the UJS, told me they knew there were Jewish supporters of the movement, but that they’d heard a lot of concerns from members. These UK protests have sprung up amid the backdrop of much larger demonstrations and occupations on campuses across the US - most prominently at Columbia University, New York, and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Those protests have seen more than 2,000 people detained over the past fortnight. While the calmness of the Newcastle camp feels a million miles away from those scenes, those who are taking part tell me that their counterparts in the US have seen what they’re doing, and have been in touch. “We’ve had some people from Columbia message us,” Frank, another student protester, tells me. Frank’s pronouns are they/them, and they asked that we not use their real name. “They just wanted to send us their solidarity - and that is really warming to see.” They say the group behind the occupation - Newcastle Apartheid Off Campus - had been organising in support of Gaza for several months, and that the occupation was planned before the recent disorder kicked off in the US. But the occupation was partly organised now to say to US students: “You’re not alone.” Students in the UK share some common goals with their US counterparts - in particular, the call for their universities to sever financial and research ties with Israel, a process known as divestment. But as well as this, Frank tells me they feel an emotional connection to students in Gaza - who, in better times, are no different to them. “There are tens of thousands of students in Gaza, and their lives are completely upended. There's no way you can pursue an education when you've got bombs raining down on you,” Frank said. “We’re sat in a peaceful university, studying, and they don’t have that opportunity.” Although it’s quiet now, rallies that are held at 5pm daily attract hundreds of other students. Frank estimates there were around 200 people at the last one. I ask one of the staff members - Dr Jemima Repo, a reader in political and feminist theory - whether she worries at all about the camp becoming disruptive during exam season. “No, not at all,” she says. The camp itself, while on the campus and visible, is set apart from walkways and entrances. “As far as I understand the relationship between campus security and police has been very good,” Dr Repo says, adding that there haven’t been any tensions among staff, either. The university, meanwhile, says it “respects the right to peaceful protests and freedom of speech” and that they are “engaging with protesters”. “Our priority is always to ensure that our campus remains safe for everyone and protests should be within the law - we do not tolerate the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour that causes, or is likely to cause, distress,” it said in a statement this week. Risk assessors also come by the camp while I’m there to make sure things are still peaceful, and that there aren’t any health and safety issues. Lecturer Dr Mori Ram also comes to chat to students and show his support. He’s originally from Israel, and has family near the border with Lebanon. The 7 October attacks by Hamas, and the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the months since, have deeply affected him. “To be honest, for the first time, I feel shame. My family is there… everything that happens there, they are exposed,” Dr Ram says. “I do think that encampments like this, and what's happening right now in the US, may provide the necessary political pressure on the Israeli government to hopefully bring things to an end, in a good way.” But Dr Mori says he knows he’s “not a representative of the majority of Israelis” with his views on the conflict. Mr Dabby-Joory, from the UJS, said that ""Jewish students, like all student communities, are broad and diverse, and there are a range of views in the Jewish student community"". “But I think many Jewish students are feeling unwelcome, uncomfortable and on edge,"" he said. “That doesn’t mean that every student is feeling it, but we know from speaking to so many of our 9,000 students across the country that so many of them are feeling those things while on campus.” The tensions within the community, and between others from her faith and those from her political groups, have affected Naomi too. “It’s incredibly isolating,” she tells me. “One of the slogans that’s often used [by Jewish pro-Palestinian activists] is ‘not in my name’. And I think, well, why should it be in anyone's name. “It's also been an incredibly isolating experience to see the reaction to pro-Palestinian activism by other Jewish people, personally and in the wider world. “It's been quite difficult at times to feel that sense of community, which has been such a big part of my upbringing.”"

Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from positions in the eastern Donetsk region. Russia is trying to take advantage of its superiority in manpower and artillery before Ukrainian forces get much-needed supplies of new US weapons. The US last week agreed a $61bn (£49bn) package of military aid for Ukraine. But new US weapons are yet to make their way to the frontlines, where Ukrainian troops have been struggling for months with a shortage of ammunition, troops and air defences. ""The situation at the front has worsened,"" Gen Syrskyi said in a post on the Telegram messaging service on Sunday. He confirmed Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from some of their positions in an area of Donetsk that had formed part of a defensive line, established after Russia captured Avdiivka in February. Much of the fighting has been taking place around Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing Avdiivka. New defensive lines had been taken up further to the west in some areas, with Gen Syrskyi conceding the loss of territory to the advancing Russians. Moscow had secured ""tactical successes in some sectors,"" he said. Gen Syrskyi added that rested Ukrainian brigades were being rotated in those areas to replace units that had suffered losses. Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday reported its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka, around 10 km (6 miles) north of Avdiivka. Gen Syrskyi became commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces in February. It followed speculation about a rift between his predecessor, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier this month, Gen Syrskyi warned the battlefield situation in the east of the country had ""significantly worsened"". The commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said this week that he was expecting an attempt by Russian forces to advance on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, which is near the Russian border. US President Joe Biden this week signed off on a $95bn (£76bn) package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after months of gridlock amid opposition to the aid from some in Congress. The Senate passed a similar aid package in February, but a group of conservatives who oppose new Ukraine support had prevented it from coming to a vote in the House of Representatives. On Friday, the Pentagon said it would ""rush"" Patriot air defence missiles and artillery ammunition to Ukraine as part of its new military aid package. Between February 2022 and January 2024, the US gave Ukraine more than $40bn in military aid, according to German research organisation, the Kiel Institute."

The Department of Commerce did not specify which permits were cancelled but US chip giants Intel and Qualcomm said they had been informed that some export licenses have been revoked. Huawei did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Since 2019, the US has restricted technology exports to Huawei, citing alleged ties to the Chinese military but companies like Intel and Qualcomm were granted some exemptions. Beijing condemned Washington's moves against its companies. The US was ""over-stretching the concept of national security and abusing export controls to suppress Chinese companies without justification,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. Some US lawmakers had criticised the administration of President Joe Biden following the launch last month of Huawei's MateBook X Pro laptop. ""Make no mistake, the Biden Administration would not have taken this action if Republicans in Congress were not holding them accountable,"" said Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik in a social media post. Huawei has been hit hard by US trade restrictions but more recently appeared to mount a comeback. The Chinese company has enjoyed a resurgence particularly after the launch of the Mate 60 Pro smartphone in August. In 2019, during the presidency of Donald Trump, US officials added Huawei to a so-called ""entity list."" It means that US companies need to obtain a licence from the government to export or transfer some technologies, especially over concerns that they will be used by the Chinese military. However, in that time licences have been granted to some US companies, including Intel and Qualcomm, to supply Huawei with technology that was not related to 5G. The US has imposed restrictions on several Chinese technology firms in recent years, as tensions between the world's two biggest economies intensified. Earlier this month President Biden signed a law that could ban the video app TikTok in the country unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company. TikTok filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to block the legislation."

The surge reflects scorching demand for the medicine which, alongside sister diabetes drug Ozempic, has been hailed as revolutionary and helped to transform Novo Nordisk into one of Europe's most valuable companies. But the drugs giant is facing new pressures, as the high price of such medicines comes under scrutiny in the US and rival offerings emerge from competitor Eli Lilly. In a quarterly update for investors, the firm said it had cut prices in the US in the first three months of the year. It said prices for Wegovy and Ozempic would continue to fall in the months ahead. But overall sales are still expected to grow by as much as 27% this year, up slightly from earlier forecasts, despite the price cuts and other supply constraints. ""With the volume opportunity we have at hand, that significantly outweighs what we see in terms of lower price points,"" chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. He attributed the price fall in part to the firm pushing to reach more ""vulnerable"" corners of the market. In all, Novo Nordisk said its diabetes and weight loss drugs served almost 42 million patients globally at the end of March. The US, where about 40% of adults are obese and more than 10% are estimated to have diabetes, represents by far the biggest market for the company. But the high price of the drugs has prompted many health insurance plans in the US - including Medicare, the government plan for seniors - to restrict access. Last month, Senator Bernie Sanders launched an investigation into the issue, noting that Novo Nordisk lists a monthly price of $1,349 (£1,078) for Wegovy in the US, whilst in the UK it can be purchased privately from around £140, and less for medical professionals. Mr Jorgenson acknowledged that demand for the treatments was ""putting strains on health care systems"". But he said he expected the firm would be able to convince regulators of the benefits of the drugs, which was also recently approved to treat heart disease. ""I'm optimistic about how we can communicate the value to health care systems of these interventions. I'm very optimistic about the underlying willingness among both patients and physicians to use these medicines,"" he said. So far, the biggest struggle Novo Nordisk has faced is keeping up with demand. It has spent recent years scrambling to try to expand its manufacturing capacity, investing in new factories. The five-fold jump in Wegovy prescriptions in the US since December is a sign that those issues are easing, said chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen. ""Clearly that is a sign of supply chains operating and running and building inventories and supplying the market,"" he said. ""You should see that as confidence in scaling."" Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017, and in 2018 in the EU. Wegovy followed in the US in 2021, and in the European Union in 2022. "

Security sources told BBC Ukrainian eight more aircraft were badly damaged, while 20 service personnel could have been killed or injured. The Morozovsk base houses Su-27 and Su-34 aircraft used on the front line in Ukraine, the sources said. There has been no word from Russia on reports of an airfield attack. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the reports. However, Russian officials said that more than 40 drones had been aimed at the region, which borders Ukraine. BBC Russian military analyst Pavel Aksyonov says an attack by so many drones over a short space of time could have overwhelmed air defences. Meanwhile, four people were killed and over 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said. The eastern city of Kharkiv also came under air attack, with local authorities reporting two deaths from the Russian bombardment. In Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said several high-rise blocks and private homes were damaged. Two missiles struck first, and then - after rescuers and police arrived - three more hit, he added. Ukrainian media said several journalists were among the injured. Earlier, Ukraine's air force said that overnight and into Friday, Russia had attacked Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions and Kharkiv with 13 drones and five missiles. All the drones were shot down, it said, but energy facilities were damaged in Odesa region, as well as residential buildings in Kharkiv. Also, Russian troops continued their slow advance in Donetsk region. Ukrainian officials said the town of Chasiv Yar was coming under constant bombardment amid reports that Russian forces had reached the outskirts. Reporting the Rostov attacks, the Russian defence ministry said Saratov, Kursk, Belgorod and Krasnodar regions had also been targeted. It said all the drones involved were shot down. In Rostov's Morozovsk district, an electrical sub-station was hit, leaving about 600 people without power for a few hours, Rostov governor Vasily Golubev said on his Telegram channel. He added that there had been some damage to a 16-storey residential block. In a later post, he said eight people had been injured by explosives detonating on one of the fallen drones during an investigation of the site ""not far from the aerodrome"". Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on targets within Russia recently, targeting military and energy facilities. It has warned repeatedly that its army is facing severe ammunition shortages, but has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year. On Tuesday it claimed responsibility for a drone attack in Tatarstan, more than 1,300km (807 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border. The strikes, targeting a drone factory and an oil refinery, are the deepest into Russian territory since the start of the war. Twelve people were reported injured."

The decision left the Federal Reserve's key rate hovering at the highest level in more than two decades, in the range of 5.25%-5.5%, where it has stood since last July. By keeping borrowing costs high, the Fed is hoping to cool the economy and reduce the pressures pushing up prices. But with inflation in the US proving more persistent than expected, the bank is facing questions about its next move. Analysts who had expected the bank to start cutting rates early this year have been forced to postpone forecasts - and some have even raised the possibility of a rate rise. At a press conference following the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said he thought that a rate increase was ""unlikely"", while repeating that officials wanted greater confidence that inflation was easing before moving to cut. ""It really will depend on the data,"" he said. ""It's going to take longer to reach that point of comfort. I don't know how long it will take,"" he added. In the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March. That is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. In its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting ""a lack of further progress"" bringing inflation back to its goal. ""The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. ""Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing."" The Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022. Higher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt. The Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. Mr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown. ""The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,"" he said. ""We can be patient."" Separately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries. It built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. Mr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight."

It's a question that has rung out across dancefloors for more than 20 years. The answer, for The Killers' Mr Brightside, lies in breaking chart records... if not actually topping the charts. The 2000s indie-rock anthem has now overtaken Oasis' Britpop ballad Wonderwall to become the UK's biggest-selling single never to reach number one. According to the Official Charts Company, Mr Brightside's 5.57 million combined sales and streams also make it the UK's third biggest song of all time, surpassing Wham!'s festive staple Last Christmas. This is calculated from an eye-watering 530.3 million streams (100 paid streams or 600 free streams equal one sale) and 1.1 million copies sold since it was first released in 2003. It already holds the record for the UK's longest-running chart hit, after spending 408 weeks - or seven whole years - in the UK top 100. Its closest competitor, Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved, is far behind, with 234 weeks in the countdown at the time of writing. Mr Brightside is streamed 1.8 million times a week on average in the UK. Last year proved its most successful on streaming services, with a cool 80 million plays. Not bad for a song that only reached number 10 in the UK on its second release in 2004 - and didn't chart at all the first time around. Now a crowd favourite from indie discos to wedding dancefloors and karaoke bars, nowhere is its cross-generational appeal more evident than at the band's live festival shows. Luke Broadhurst, 51, says the song is ""one of the few the whole family loves"", including his teenage son and daughter. ""Festivals have given it legendary status for us, from Latitude, with my then 10-year-old old daughter Roxy on my shoulders, to seeing them headline Glastonbury in 2019. ""Being part of 130,000 fans was about as biblical an experience as you can get."" Roxy, now 17, says experiencing Mr Brightside at Reading Festival with her friends was ""the best thing I've seen live - uplifting, a sense of unity, it's seen as the national anthem. ""At house parties people belt out the lyrics, it's a classic."" Reflecting on the song's seismic impact, The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers told the Official Charts Company: ""It's incredible. I recently went to see Ed Sheeran in Las Vegas, and I joined him for a version of Mr Brightside. ""These are people that may not be Killers fans, but it just lit up like a casino in this place when we started playing Mr Brightside."" So how did it all happen? Flowers wrote the lyrics when he was about 20, after discovering his girlfriend had been cheating on him. Around that time, Flowers met guitarist Dave Keuning, who'd already written Mr Brightside's backing track. As soon as Flowers heard that chiming riff, his heartbreak spilled onto the page. ""When I first heard those chords, I wrote the lyrics down and we didn't waste much time,"" he told Spin magazine. ""That's also why there's not a second verse. The second is the same as the first. I just didn't have any other lines and it ended up sticking."" The primitive demo was a much darker song. Flowers alternately sounds angry and on the verge of tears - his vocals raw and raspy against a grungy, fuzztone guitar. But when it came to recording the studio version, he adopted a more detached, almost voyeuristic tone. Mr Brightside was the first complete song The Killers wrote - and the only track to survive from the original version of their debut album, Hot Fuss. All the other songs were scrapped after The Strokes released Is This It, a record that redefined US guitar music at the start of the millennium. ""That record just sounded so perfect,"" Flowers told the NME in 2012. ""We threw away everything [we were working on] and the only song that made the cut and remained was Mr Brightside."" The Killers debuted Mr Brightside at their first ever show, in Las Vegas in 2002 - a gig Flowers later recalled was ""terrible"". Things didn't improve for some time. Their sound, heavily influenced by British bands like The Cure, New Order and Depeche Mode, was unpalatable to the US record industry. It wasn't until their demo found its way to UK indie label Lizard King that they landed a record deal. ""Everyone in America had turned them down,"" said label boss Martin Heath. He was particularly impressed by the band's frontman. ""It was very clear to me that he was a major star. He had huge charisma."" Lizard King released Mr Brightside in 2003 in a limited run of 500 CD singles, and it got its first review in The Times. ""Mr Brightside is one of those records that come along all too rarely and make you think, hel-lo,"" wrote Dan Cairns. ""A fantastically bleak and catchy ode to romantic paranoia and jealousy, it nails that moment in a love affair when one half is suddenly forced to accommodate the possibility that the other half is playing away."" Despite the buzz, 500 copies wasn't enough to make a dent in the charts, and The Killers seemed destined to become a footnote in musical history. But destiny was calling them... After a second single, Somebody Told Me, crept into the top 40, The Killers were signed to Island Records in America and Mr Brightside was re-released. This time, the song caught fire, making the top 10 in both the UK and US. Even so, there was no indication that Mr Brightside would become a defining anthem of the 2000s. Flowers first realised Mr Brightside could become one of those songs when The Killers played Glastonbury's John Peel tent in 2004. ""It went off,"" the singer told Rolling Stone. ""It looked like footage of the Sex Pistols!"" Pretty soon, the song began to reappear in the lower reaches of the charts. It made number 100 in the first week of 2005, as fans spent their Christmas record tokens (remember those?) on the remaining copies of the single. Once downloads started being counted towards the countdown in July 2005, Mr Brightside would pop into the charts every time The Killers played a festival or toured the UK. Meanwhile, the song became a staple of wedding parties and student discos. Ed Balls shrugged off his defeat in the 2010 Labour leadership race with a karaoke version, and Coronation Street star Andy Whyment made it his party piece on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. In December 2018, Mr Brightside reached the landmark of one million pure sales (ie downloads and CD sales). But its unparalleled chart run truly began in 2014, when the Official Chart Company incorporated streams into its calculations. Since then, it has taken up semi-permanent residence in the lower reaches of the countdown, becoming the most-streamed song of any track released before 2010. At the time of writing, it features on 60 million separate Spotify playlists. The company says it's most likely to appear on playlists designed for road trips, although it also features on Billie Eilish's Life Playlist and compilations from Ultimate Party Classics to Darts: All the Walk-On Songs. While some bands grow to resent the idea of being forever associated with their debut single, Flowers has said he's proud Mr Brightside has ""stood the test of time"", insisting in 2015 : ""I never get bored of singing it."" Fans, it seems, never get bored of hearing it either. This article updates an earlier version first published in April 2021, when Mr Brightside was announced as the UK's longest-running chart hit."
politics,politics,Negative,"['University of Texas', 'Yale University', 'Columbia', 'Yale', 'University of Southern California', 'USC']",US campus protests: 'Student arrests will be my final college memory',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68946501,2024-05-04,0.2208341619265668,Scandal,False,Desertification,"In January 2020, they were seniors in high school. Graduation was just around the corner. But so was a deadly pandemic. By mid-March, Covid had upended daily life and many students were forced to spend their final months of school at home. Proms were cancelled. Four years later, those same students are now in college about to graduate. And once again, they face a similar souring of what would normally be a festive occasion. Pro-Palestinian protests have erupted at over 130 college campuses across the US, as organisers demand their universities cut ties from companies linked to Israel. They've set up vast encampments in the middle of university grounds and defied multiple warnings to disperse, sparking police raids and over 2,000 arrests. Three seniors explain how they're dealing with this tumultuous ending of their academic careers - for the second time. Madison Morris, 22, University of Texas The day the state troopers came in, that was also the day I had my last final exam. When I got to campus, they were already there and were closing in on students. The tension was super high. I had never been that close to so many police before. It was scary. I didn't really study for my exam later that day - I couldn't focus. All I kept thinking about was what I had just seen. I doubt I did as well on the exam as I wanted. My last day of class was the day I saw protesters - my fellow students - who were peacefully gathered on the main lawn, getting dragged away by police and arrested. That's something that's going to be ingrained in my memory forever. Those are going to be the memories of my final moments in college. It's hard to even feel happy right now while seeing all the negative stuff that's happening. I feel like I can't even really celebrate my accomplishments, because I'm just so overwhelmed. Graduation is next week. I had been looking forward to it for the last four years, because I didn't get to have a real one in high school. Because of Covid, we had to wear masks and there was social distancing. It wasn't the same. I was really hoping for a traditional graduation this year. I have been trying to make the most of my senior year and really just take it all in, but it's hard when stuff like this is going on. Like Covid, honestly, it all feels super dystopian. Craig Birckhead-Morton, 21, Yale University I was one of the 48 students arrested on 22 April. I woke up in the encampment at 6:30 to warnings from our safety marshals that we're being surrounded by the police. They told us to get up and prepare for arrest. I went to class the same day. It's been a very difficult time - a whole new level of stress. I have two final papers due. I have an Arabic project due. And I'm still behind on it because of everything that's going on. Senior year is extremely important, considering my family in all of this. They want to see me graduate. It's been a major concern of mine. We still haven't heard how the university plans to respond. And in many ways that's scarier than our actual legal charges. We might not be allowed to walk at graduation. We might not receive our diplomas or final transcripts. For me, the transcript is critical. I need it to matriculate into the master's programme I was accepted into at Columbia. Personally, I feel that all this knowledge I'm acquiring at Yale needs to go to a just cause. That's why I felt it necessary to hold the line on this. The situation in Palestine is unacceptable. I remember the first week of March during my senior year of high school. We were sent home and things were made remote. We didn't know that would be the end, but it was. No prom, no graduation. The pandemic was a major disruptor, but so were the Black Lives Matter protests. That was also a crucial part of the end of my high school experience and something that led me into organising and where I am today. Melissa Manesh, 21, University of Southern California This is supposed to be a happy time, the last few days on campus we'll ever have as students. And now it's being taken over by protesters. There's so much chaos happening. It's frustrating. The protesters are ruining student life. Libraries aren't being open at a time when most people are trying to study for final exams. There are helicopters flying around. Only two entrances are open to campus, which forces some of us to walk extra-long distances. Protesters are also blocking a huge area on campus and making it feel unsafe to walk through. I know for the Jewish students, a lot of us are scared. They'll shout at you. They'll call you a genocide supporter. We don't want to see these protesters and their signs that are extremely offensive. It heightens the stress of having to study. It's hard not to think about this when it's all happening right in front of you. It's extremely distracting. If you had told me that graduation was going to be cancelled, I wouldn't have believed you. When we found out, we were all really distraught and upset. This was supposed to be one of the biggest moments of our academic careers - one that we've all been waiting for - and now it's gone. I was also the class of 2020 for high school, and we didn't have a graduation then because of Covid. This feels really similar, and it's so sad and so upsetting. But now it feels much deeper and much more personal. It's not every graduating senior in the world this time that's losing their ceremony. It's just every graduating senior at USC."
tech,business,Positive,"['SUM', 'Society of Automotive Engineers', 'Monash University', 'BBC', 'the Seoul City Bus Union', 'Tesla', 'AVs']","Look, no hands! My trip on Seoul's self-driving bus",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68823705,2024-04-21,0.12818444661672013,Normal,False,Air pollution,"There is a moment on the A21 bus, at around midnight, when the man in the driver's seat presses a small red button on his dashboard. He smiles, then lets go of the steering wheel and lifts his feet from the pedals. The vehicle continues to glide through the streets of South Korea's capital, Seoul, turning corners and stopping at traffic lights. No-one on board seems to notice. ""One day all the buses in Seoul will be driverless,"" says Park Sang-uk, head of operations at SUM (Smart YoUr Mobility). His company has spent the past four years developing the city's new self-driving night bus, which authorities say is the first of its kind anywhere in the world. These kinds of buses and cars are known as autonomous vehicles or AVs. ""There are fewer and fewer people who want to drive buses, especially at night,"" Mr Park says. ""This is the perfect solution to help fill that void."" The quiet night-time roads are also the ideal place to test the technology, which is still far from perfect. There are some safety measures on board. For example, passengers have to be sitting down and must wear a seatbelt at all times. There is also someone in the driver's seat, who can take control of the bus in case something goes wrong. Soon, Mr Park insists, there won't be any need for that. The journey is mostly smooth. It took us past the glowing storefronts of the city centre and then into the capital's more dimly-lit residential neighbourhoods - stopping about 20 times on the way. At first, looking at the steering wheel moving by itself, then seeing the bus ghost to the left and right accordingly, is enough to fill you with trepidation. But soon that feeling passes. Having said that, there are a couple of times when the driver has to take the wheel and hit the brakes. These sudden jolts are a reminder that human drivers are on the road and the artificial intelligence (AI) controlling the bus is not prepared for every eventuality. Most passengers were fairly relaxed though. ""I was excited to try this,"" said one student on his way home from university. ""The fact that it's a late-night bus also means it can reduce the burden on drivers."" ""I had no idea this was a driverless bus!"" said one woman who had just finished work. ""You really wouldn't know."" Another student, visiting from the Netherlands, seemed a little less convinced: ""I was a bit nervous getting onboard. Seeing the driver sitting there did reassure me a bit."" The US-based Society of Automotive Engineers categorises AVs from Level 1 to 5. Level 1, the most basic, relates to vehicles with features such as cruise control, while Level 5 is a fully-automated vehicle that can operate under any conditions and in any situation. These do not currently exist. Seoul's new night bus is a Level 3 vehicle, which means that some human intervention is required in certain situations. The most advanced AVs operating at the moment are in China and the United States, passengers can take a Level 4 taxi in Beijing, and parts of California and Arizona. These cars have no safety driver but must stick to certain roads and routes. How far self-driving technology can actually advance is up for debate. Without a complete overhaul of how our cities function some experts doubt whether truly autonomous vehicular traffic is possible. ""The view that autonomous cars are our future is sheer science fiction"", says Graham Currie, a professor of public transport at Monash University in Melbourne. ""It's nonsense, quite frankly. On the street we have dogs, we have children, we have weather, we have other vehicles. Technology hasn't sorted all of that out yet and it may never do."" According to Professor Currie, governments are especially interested in the possibilities of autonomous public transport because the majority of the cost of a bus route is the driver's salary. Naturally, this has led to some concern among bus drivers. The trade union representing Seoul's 18,000 bus drivers told the BBC that the city government has never contacted them about its plans for an autonomous future. ""Self-driving should not replace human labour completely,"" says Yoo Jae-ho, Secretary-General of the Seoul City Bus Union. ""Right now, I don't think that's even possible - it's too dangerous."" ""If self-driving technology is ready and it can be implemented one day, then it should come along with re-education and re-hiring support programmes for the bus drivers and maintenance workers."" South Korean authorities are planning to invest more than $1bn (£810m) in projects to develop autonomous driving technologies and build related infrastructure by 2027. China is also making strides when it comes to self-driving vehicles. Last week, the ride-hailing firm Didi announced a partnership with state-owned electric vehicle manufacturer GAC Aion to mass-produce a fleet of Level 4 robotaxis. Tesla boss Elon Musk said earlier this month that his electric car maker would unveil its own robotaxi in August. However, Professor Currie argues that investing in private AVs does little to address real transport problems faced by cities. ""I don't want to be negative. I do believe it's worth experimenting with new systems,"" he said. ""But I find myself being sceptical"". ""Having thousands of autonomous cars driving around a city, often empty, is only going to make make our roads more congested - not less."" Back on the A21, we reach the end of the line. The man behind the wheel, an ex-bus driver who's in his 60s, waves me goodbye. Before getting off I ask him what he thinks about the new technology. ""It's easy for me to say, but I think it's great,"" he laughs. ""Driving a bus at night is a hard job - I don't think many people would miss doing this."" Additional reporting by Hosu Lee"

The 27-year-old told BBC Newsnight he has donated about £1m to help people in his home country since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. He said Ukraine has become a ""shield"" for Europe and called for more support. On Wednesday, the country's president signed into law a bill lowering the military mobilisation age from 27 to 25. This would allow the country to call up more people to replenish its reserves and comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky said in December that the country would need 500,000 more soldiers to be mobilised. BBC Newsnight asked the footballer whether he would answer a call-up to fight, if he saw more value in that than staying to play football in the Premier League. ""I think it's a clear answer. I would go [to fight]"", he said. He added that he had former school friends fighting on the frontline. ""It's tough to understand that just recently we've been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,"" he said. ""And, honestly, [it's] so hard to accept this, but it is what it is. We cannot give up."" Mr Zinchenko said the situation in the country is ""super tough"" but he and his family were ""proud of our president"". ""I know maybe some people might think that it's much easier … for me being here [in London] rather than being there [in Ukraine]. I really hope that this war will end soon,"" he said. The Arsenal defender began his football career with Russian team Ufa in 2016, and said he no longer talks to his friends or former teammates that are in Russia. ""Since the invasion really few [have] texted mebut I stopped any communication since February 2022. They sent me some messages and I can't blame them because this is not their fault,"" he said. ""I cannot tell them, 'Guys, do the protests outside and all these things', because I know they can be [put] in prison. ""But I have a question to the people of Russia - how do you live in the country where you don't have a freedom of speech at all?"" He said Russians used to call Ukrainians their ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but the invasion has shown ""all of us Ukrainians that we can't be friends with them any more"". ""We will never forget what they have done to us, to our people,"" he said. ""And that's what I will teach my kids as well. And my kids will teach their kids. This is not acceptable."" In February, President Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during Russia's full-scale invasion and tens of thousands of civilians had died in areas of the country occupied by Russia. In the first few days of the invasion, Mr Zinchenko said he sent money to help refugees in Ukraine, and his donations have amounted to over £1m. He added that he knows of hundreds of children whose parents have died in the war. The Arsenal star said: ""What is my duty now? How can I help as much as I can to my country, to my people, over there and all these things? ""I can't be more proud than I am right now to be Ukrainian. ""I have a dream that this war will end very, very soon, and we can rebuild our Ukraine like we really want [to]."" Additional reporting by Tetiana Kharchenko and Jasmin Dyer.

business,business,Negative,"['Boeing', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'BBC', 'Boeing', 'Quality Management System', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'BBC', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', 'the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration']",Boeing: Dead whistleblower warned of safety breaches,https://www.bbc.com/news/68907597,2024-04-27,0.16870919890180924,Scandal,False,Illegal logging,"A former Boeing employee, who was found dead in March, accused the company of ""countless"" violations of US law in testimony given just before his death. John Barnett claimed the firm tried to ""eliminate"" quality inspections at a plant that makes 787 planes. The former quality control manager had been giving a formal legal deposition against the plane manufacturer. The 62-year-old's death after two days of testimony was from a ""self-inflicted gunshot wound"", officials said. Boeing says it was ""saddened"" by Mr Barnett's death, but said the issues he raised had been reviewed and addressed. The aerospace giant's safety standards are currently under the spotlight, in part due to an incident in January when a disused door fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off. The transcript of Mr Barnett's deposition has now been released by his lawyers. The lengthy document runs to more than 140 pages. Mr Barnett had worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before his retirement on health grounds in 2017. He subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he had suffered retaliation from managers after raising a number of serious safety concerns, a charge the company denies. The bulk of Mr Barnett's deposition focuses on the period from 2010 onwards, after he had moved from Boeing's facility in Everett, Washington to what was then a brand-new factory in North Charleston. The plant had been set up to help assemble the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes. Mr Barnett had previously told the BBC and others that managers there had routinely ignored formal procedures in order to build planes as quickly as possible. In his deposition, he provided more detail on these allegations, in support of his legal complaint that he had been ""denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn"" by senior managers, who had subjected him to a gaslighting campaign, and created a ""hostile work environment"" as a result of his actions. A key part of his testimony focused on the alleged falsification of records relating to problems within the production process and in particular the logging of defective or substandard parts. He claimed employees had been under pressure to circumvent established procedures, set out in Boeing's own Quality Management System, to save time. A common theme within the factory, he said, was: ""We don't have time to follow processes, we're building airplanes"". This, he said, had allowed ""an awful lot"" of faulty parts onto the production line, while others had simply been lost. These included two large sections of aircraft fuselage, which ""weren't anywhere to be found"". In one specific instance, he claimed a contaminated and faulty tube designed to work in an oxygen system had been removed from a scrap bin and might have been installed on an aircraft that was now in service. Such parts normally had to be carefully sterilised to reduce the risk of unwanted chemical reactions. Without that, he said, there was a risk that if the system was activated, it could cause an explosion that would ""bring the whole plane down"". He suggested that there had been ""countless"" occasions on which paperwork had been falsified, and agreed with his lawyer's suggestion that each violation of procedure amounted to a ""criminal offense and felony"". Mr Barnett was also deeply critical of what he saw as a drive at the South Carolina plant to reduce quality control inspections, again to speed up the manufacturing process. ""So the push for probably the last 15 to 20 years at Boeing is to eliminate quality [inspections]"", he said. ""But when here in Charleston they put that push on steroids"". Boeing's own lawyers focused more on Mr Barnett's claims that he had been retaliated against, and appeared to question his assertion that his safety concerns had not been taken seriously at the time. In a statement given to the BBC, Boeing said: ""We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing and our thoughts continue to be with his family and friends. ""Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety"". It also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law. It added: ""We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously. ""To ensure the safety, quality and conformance of our products, we investigate all allegations of improper behaviour. We then work diligently to address them and make improvements."" Mr Barnett's lawsuit is expected to continue. It will be taken forward by his mother Vicky Stokes and his brother Rodney Barnett as representatives of his estate. The case is now expected to go to trial in September."

In the filing, the social media company called the act an ""extraordinary intrusion on free speech rights"" of the company and its 170 million American users. It said the US had put forward only ""speculative concerns"" to justify the measure and asked the court to stop it. President Joe Biden signed the bill into law last month , citing national security justifications. It followed years of debate in Washington, which has claimed that TikTok's Chinese ownership raises the risk that data on US users could fall into the hands of the Chinese government or be used for propaganda. TikTok has maintained it is independent of the government, while parent company ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell the business. The Chinese government has criticised the law as US ""bullying"" of a foreign firm and signalled it would oppose a sale. In a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the law was ""not a ban. It is a divestment"". She referred further questions to the Department of Justice which declined to comment. Under the US law, app stores would be barred from offering TikTok in the US starting in January 2025, unless parent company ByteDance found a buyer. President Biden could extend that deadline by 90 days if talks are making progress. In the filing with the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday, TikTok said the sale requirement was ""simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.  And certainly not on the 270-day timeline required by the Act"". It said the measure had unfairly singled out TikTok, creating a “two-tiered speech regime with one set of rules for one named platform, and another set of rules for everyone else”. It noted that similar attempted bans, including by former president Donald Trump, had met with trouble in US courts. The company added that the decision by many politicians, including Mr Biden, to maintain accounts on the app undermined the claims of a security threat. The US has in the past restricted foreign ownership of broadcast television and radio stations, which require government licences to access public airwaves. TikTok said its business was distinct, and the government could not dictate ownership of ""privately created speech forums"". It said it had spent more than $2bn in an effort to address US concerns, creating safeguards on US data. Jacob Helberg, who leads a committee charged by Congress with monitoring the national security implications of US-China trade, said TikTok's investments were viewed in Washington as a ""deceptive marketing effort"". He said the lawsuit was ""unserious"" and failed ""to address the national security question at hand"". But Ashley Gorski, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union,  said TikTok's lawsuit made a persuasive case that the measure was an effective ban, despite White House claims to the contrary, raising free speech concerns. ""The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,"" she said. ""There is no public evidence of harm that would meet the extraordinarily high bar imposed by the first amendment."" She said comments by lawmakers, such as US Senator Mitt Romney, who recently tied the widespread support for the measure in Congress to the desire to shape US perceptions of the Israel-Gaza conflict, would make it harder for the US to defend the law. But Congressman John Moolenaar, the current leader of the committee that helped to craft the law, said he was confident it would be upheld. “Congress and the Executive Branch have concluded, based on both publicly available and classified information, that TikTok poses a grave risk to national security and the American people,"" he said. ""It is telling that TikTok would rather spend its time, money, and effort fighting in court than solving the problem by breaking up with the Chinese Communist Party."" The law aimed at TikTok is part of a number of actions the US has taken against Chinese technology firms in recent years, as tensions rise between the world's two biggest economies. Separately on Tuesday, the Department of Commerce confirmed it had revoked permissions that had allowed US companies to export certain goods to Chinese technology giant Huawei . The US sharply limited exports of items such as computer chips to Huawei starting in 2019, citing ties to the Chinese military. The measures hit the company hard but more recently it appeared to mount a comeback ."

A masked pro-Israeli group assaulted a pro-Palestinian student camp, before officers were called to the campus. Governor Gavin Newsom's spokesperson said the ""limited and delayed"" police intervention was ""unacceptable"". Hundreds of police swarmed the campus early on Wednesday morning after more than two hours of fighting. State officials and university leaders have said they immediately deployed security personnel to the tent camp on Dickson Plaza when clashes erupted just before midnight on Tuesday. But several people on site said law enforcement did not act quickly enough. ""Law enforcement simply stood at the edge of the lawn and refused to budge as we screamed for their help,"" UC Divest at LA, a group involved in the encampment, said in a statement. The BBC has contacted UCLA and LAPD for a response. The university declared the pro-Palestinian encampment, in the shadow of its Royce Hall, an illegal gathering on Tuesday. Footage online shows that, as midnight approached on Tuesday, a large pro-Israeli group donning black outfits and white masks arrived on campus and attempted to dismantle barriers. Campers, some wearing goggles and helmets, and others carrying placards and umbrellas, rallied to defend their makeshift space. Dylan Winward, a reporter with the Daily Bruin student newspaper, said the counter-demonstrators had thrown objects including ""fireworks, a scooter, water bottles and tear gas"". The Bruin also said on social media that four of its reporters had been assaulted and sprayed with an irritant early on Wednesday morning by attackers who recorded the incident on their mobile phones. ""Tonight they escalated to a whole new level, they started inciting violence,"" one pro-Palestinian student activist told the BBC. Protesters started leaving the site roughly two hours after the attack began and police had established control as day broke on Wednesday morning. It is unclear whether police made any arrests. Governor Newsom condemned the violence in a post on X, formerly Twitter, separate to his office's statement. ""The law is clear,"" he said. ""The right to free speech does not extend to inciting violence, vandalism or lawlessness."" He said those responsible ""must be held accountable... including through criminal prosecution, suspension, or expulsion"". Citing law enforcement sources, the Los Angeles Times reports there were only a few UCLA police officers on hand and they retreated because they were outnumbered by the crowd. According to the newspaper, reinforcements were called from California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles and it took three hours to bring the situation under control. The overnight clash at one of America's top public colleges took place only hours after police in New York City raided and cleared a Columbia University building taken over by students. Protests at Columbia against the war in Gaza have inspired similar actions at universities - small and large, public and private - in more than two dozen states, with activists demanding that institutions cut financial ties with Israel and companies profiting from the war. On Wednesday, state troopers arrested 17 anti-war protesters at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the BBC's Tom Bateman on campus, while the NYPD arrested at least 15 people at Fordham University in the Bronx. UCLA cancelled classes on Wednesday, as it sought to ease tensions on the central quad of its Westwood campus. Mary Osako, a UCLA vice-chancellor, said police and other first responders were called to the scene of its encampment over ""horrific acts of violence"" early on Wednesday morning. ""We are sickened by this senseless violence and it must end,"" she said. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass slammed the clashes as ""absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable"". Speaking later on Wednesday, she called for an investigation into the violence. ""Those involved in launching fireworks at other people, spraying chemicals and physically assaulting others will be found, arrested and prosecuted, as well as anyone involved in any form of violence or lawlessness,"" she said. By morning, a tight security cordon was in place as a handful of protesters fortified their encampment. It remains unclear how many of the people involved in the night-time chaos, particularly on the pro-Israeli side, are students at the university. The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations blamed the violence on a ""mob of pro-Israel extremists"". Meanwhile, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles sought to distance itself from the violence, but blamed the university's chancellor for allowing ""an environment to be created over many months that has made students feel unsafe"". ""The abhorrent actions of a few counterprotesters last night do not represent the Jewish community or our values,"" the group wrote. ""We believe in peaceful, civic discourse."" Earlier on Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said several out of some 300 arrests at two New York campuses had been ""outside agitators"". Pressure has been mounting on college leaders to rein in pro-Palestinian protests as they spread across the country. But University of California leaders had sought to pursue a more light-touch approach to the demonstrations that colleagues across the country. College guidance to managing protests changed in 2011, after heavy handed policing during a demonstration on campus sparked outrage. Guidelines stated that the college should allow protests as long as they are peaceful, with police action used as a last resort. Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

entertainment,entertainment,Neutral,"['TikTokker', 'BBC Newsbeat', 'BBC iPlayer', 'BBC']",I Kissed A Girl: Dating show contestants on finding love and friends,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68928538,2024-05-04,0.09704331293548041,Normal,False,Overfishing,"Last summer, I Kissed A Boy made history as the UK's first gay dating show. Now it's the girls' turn. I Kissed A Girl - as you might have guessed - puts a cast of lesbian and bisexual women at the centre. Ten contestants are shacked up in an Italian villa and, as the title suggests, they're introduced with a kiss. Like its predecessor it will be hosted by Dannii Minogue, but this time it's TikTokker Charley Marlowe stepping in to the voiceover booth. The contestants on the show come from a range of backgrounds, and BBC Newsbeat spoke to three - Priya, Amy and Demi - about their journeys before the show. Priya is a Sikh, and says she's been fortunate to feel embraced by her religion, something she speaks about on the show. ""Just because you're queer doesn't mean you can't be religious,"" she says. ""I just think your own relationship with God is very personal and you don't have to share that with anyone else."" By speaking about her own experiences it on the programme, Priya hopes to encourage ""other South Asian and queer women to feel comfortable with who they are"". ""It might be different for other people, but I'm a Sikh,"" she explains. While some Sikhs face homophobia and there are opposing views on same-sex marriage within the religion, Priya says she follows the interpretation of love as something that exists on a spiritual rather than physical level. ""Basically, the religion is just like falling in love with a soul,"" she says. ""It's not necessarily a gender, or a person, but a soul. ""I think that's really beautiful. ""And that's why I love the religion so much and I do speak about it on the show."" But Demi had a more difficult time coming out to her family. She has a Nigerian background, and same-sex activity is illegal in the country. While she says she was able to casually drop the fact she liked girls in to conversation, Demi says she hasn't spoken to her dad since appearing on the show. ""He made suggestions that I'd go back to the villages in Nigeria where they didn't really accept queer people - so that was very hurtful at the time,"" she says. ""And then, since I also told him that I was going on the show, we haven't spoken. ""So yeah, I think it's difficult. But I'm 24 - it doesn't affect me as much as it would have, like, in my youth. It's fine."" Demi says she has a strong support network thanks to her mum and sister and new friends from the show. ""Even when all that happened with my dad, I felt still quite safe, because of my friends,"" she says. Amy has two sisters who are gay, and says she's been out to her family for a few years now. But she says being on the show will still be interesting because a lot of people at home don't know about her sexuality. ""Growing up, I found it quite difficult,"" she says. ""So they're going to see my face and hear my voice, which is going to be quite an experience."" She says her sisters would have loved to see a show like I Kissed A Girl when they were younger. ""If we had that growing up, that would have been such an amazing thing to see,"" she says. Amy says she hopes the show will challenge another preconception lots of LGBT females face - how they're expected to look. ""I had different kind of levels of what I would consider masculine, feminine, and then going in and meeting all these new people completely changed that,"" she says. ""It's really just knocking down that binary."" Demi and Priya say that one of the biggest challenges they face is people assuming they're heterosexual because they present as more feminine. ""They assume you're not a lesbian, because of the way you look,"" Priya says. ""I feel like we're all femme here,"" Demi says. ""So I think everyone comes to the assumption that we're not looking for other women or non-binary people."" Whether they find love or not will be revealed on the show, but all the contestants say the show has helped them make ""friends for life"". ""I had no gay friends, like the only people I knew who were gay were the women I dated,"" Priya says. ""And coming into that environment, meeting all these amazing, colourful, beautiful women and building friendships with each and every one of them is so amazing. ""And I'm gonna have queer friends for life."" Amy says meeting the other girls on the show, who come from all over the UK, gave her the chance to meet people she never normally would. ""So it's just adding just layers and layers and layers to my chosen family,"" she says. ""And it's amazing."" I Kissed a Girl will begin on BBC iPlayer on 5 May. Episodes will air on BBC Three every Sunday and Monday night at 9pm. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here ."

They did so as Minouche Shafik, Columbia's president, made her way to Capitol Hill to face a Congressional grilling over antisemitism on campus and how she was tackling it. In nearly four hours of questioning that Wednesday, she defended actions she was already taking. Students, she said, were ""getting the message that violations of our policies will have consequences"". The next afternoon, the Columbia president made a decision that would ignite a wildfire of protest at colleges across the United States. The students at the protest camp were trespassing, had refused to leave and had created a ""harassing and intimidating environment"" for many of their peers, she said. She was sending in the NYPD. Soon after, officers from the largest police department in the US, wearing riot gear and wielding plastic handcuffs, arrested more than 100 students - the first time mass arrests had been made on Columbia's campus since Vietnam War protests more than five decades ago. ""It was a shock to us all,"" said Rashida Mustafa, a doctoral student at Columbia. ""I was in disbelief. But it felt like a call to action."" The outrage among students was immediate. By the next day, another protest camp was established at a different lawn just a few metres away. It was much bigger than before, having swelled from a small number of tents to a congested campsite, complete with buffet-style meals of donated food, live performances and a ""security team"" at the gate watching for infiltrators. A day later, another protest camp was set up just over 70 miles (112km) north-east of Columbia, at Yale University in Connecticut, another elite institution. By the middle of this week, demonstrations were taking place at dozens of campuses across the country, and they stretched into the weekend: US police said on Saturday they had ended another protest at Northeastern University in Boston, arresting about 100 people. The Columbia students have sparked a national movement. The students' anger over how Israel is fighting its war against Hamas has raised fraught questions for university leaders, who are already struggling with combustive campus debates around what is happening in the Middle East. How do they balance the right to protest and free speech with the need to protect other students from harm and abuse? When do they send in the police to enforce university policies, knowing heavy-handed responses will be filmed and appear instantly on millions of social media feeds? At Yale, police arrived at a protest encampment in the heart of the campus in the early hours of 22 April as many students were still asleep. Nearly 50 students were arrested after refusing to leave, with some locking arms around a flagpole. ""They came very quickly, and with no warning. Droves of police just poured into the plaza,"" Chisato Kimura, a law student, told the BBC from New Haven. ""Seeing a militarised force, invited by Yale to come onto campus, was very jarring,"" she added. ""We were peacefully protesting."" US college campuses have been a flashpoint for Gaza war protests since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages. Since then more than 34,000 people, most of them women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. But the past 10 days have seen the most intense and widespread US protests of the past six months. Simmering tensions boiled over after the first Columbia camp was cleared - clashes and arrests followed elsewhere. At the University of Texas at Austin, state troopers - some on horseback - stopped hundreds of students occupying a university lawn on Wednesday. At Emory University in Atlanta, a female professor was wrestled to the ground by a police officer, and a video of her being stopped and handcuffed went viral on Thursday. Police have also taken on protesters at Emerson College in Boston, George Washington University in Washington DC, New York University and the University of Southern California (USC). The protest encampments are calling on university administrators to ""divest"" school endowments from companies they perceive as linked to Israel's war in Gaza, cut ties with Israeli academic institutions and formally call for a ceasefire Some Jewish students and faculty have said they fear for their safety. And these concerns are part of what has prompted university officials, including Ms Shafik, to call in police. ""Students have a right to protest,"" said Page Fortna, a political science professor at Columbia. ""But they don't have a right to protest in a way that makes other students feel discriminated against or harassed."" In interviews this week, Jewish students at several campuses spoke of incidents that made them feel uncomfortable, ranging from chants and signs supporting Hamas, a proscribed terror group, to physical altercations and perceived threats. Eli Kia, a 22-year-old Jewish student at USC, said the protests had left him with a constant sense of unease and fear. He has begun hiding a Star of David he wears on a chain. ""It's challenging to feel safe coming to school every day,"" he told the BBC. ""There's that second thought when you walk on campus of 'what am I going to walk into?' and 'what am I facing?', and 'who's potentially coming after me?'"" Northeastern University authorities said some of the protesters had used antisemitic slogans, which is why they decided to take action on Saturday. The university said the demonstration started as a student protests but that outsiders had also joined it. Many protesters have sought to distance themselves from antisemitic incidents and in some cases they have blamed outside agitators. They say that many Jewish students have joined the protests and that the focus should be on the civilian death toll in Gaza. As negotiations between institutions and students grind on, many demonstrators - and their outside supporters - are convinced that what they see as heavy-handed police tactics will help keep the movement going. ""This is a movement that started with only 70 students,"" Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat fiercely critical of the Biden administration's Gaza policy, told the BBC while visiting the Columbia encampment this week. ""And because Columbia University decided to crack down on them and violate their first amendment, this has now spread nationally and internationally."" Her daughter was one of the Columbia protesters arrested. Omar Zegar, a protester at USC, said he believed Columbia was only the start of a wider movement. ""I think a lot of universities nationwide will begin doing these encampments,"" he said. ""The police escalated the situation."" For some observers, the protests hark back to the 1960s, and demonstrations against US involvement in the Vietnam War. Marianne Hirsch, a Columbia professor who participated in the 1960s protests, told reporters this week that - like with the Vietnam War - the situation in Gaza should make it ""impossible to continue business as usual"". The wave of protests also adds to a politically stressful time for President Joe Biden, who has been criticised by some for his country's backing of Israel, as he campaigns for re-election. Some Democrats fear thousands of protesters will swarm this summer's national convention in Chicago, where the party will formally make him its presidential nominee. The 1968 convention, also in Chicago, was overshadowed by Vietnam War demonstrations. Ahmad Hasan, a USC graduate who attended rallies this week, said he believed that the student protests would have a wider impact on US attitudes. ""It has always rested on students to tell people that this is not right,"" he said, ""that we won't stand for this."""

I've done interviews with the likes of Zoe Ball, Jeremy Clarkson and Chris Tarrant. There has been a common theme to these stories, and it is all about how each celebrity made vast sums of money from an online investment opportunity in crypto currencies. And if this all sounds a bit unbelievable, that's because it is - I hadn't done a single one of these interviews, nor written any of the articles. And none of the famous people involved, or me, would dream of endorsing crypto investments of any kind. Instead, the fake stories were all AI-generated scams that appeared on Facebook news feeds in a BBC template, and with my byline. The fraudsters behind them hope that people will click through to the full article, and from there be tempted to invest in a fake investment scheme being promoted on the page. I was curious as to how these scam posts were getting onto Facebook in the first place, so I contacted Tony Gee, a senior consultant at cybersecurity firm Penn Test Partners. After examining the URL, or web address, of one scam page he said it was most likely a paid-for Facebook advert. Mr Gee said he could tell that because the URL had a unique value that Facebook adds to allow it to track outbound clicks. I put this finding to Facebook's owner Meta, who said: ""We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms, and have removed the ads brought to our attention."" But how are the scammers able to get the fake ads onto Facebook news feeds in the first place? How can they get past Facebook's automated detection systems? Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, says the criminals appear to be using tools that very quickly redirect users to another web page. So when the advert is first placed with Facebook, the link goes through to a harmless page, one that doesn't try to con you out of your cash. But then once this has been approved by Facebook, the fraudsters then put on a redirect that instantly takes people somewhere else - to a web page that very much wants to maliciously dent your bank account. ""If you control a website then it is relatively easy to include a redirect command, such that before someone's browser has had a chance to show them the original webpage, their browser is sent to an alternative one,"" says Prof Woodward. He adds that the fraudsters can quickly and easily keep changing the destination of the redirect. ""As soon as you are able to obfuscate the true nature of a URL, that is manna for scammers,"" he says. This is a type of online fraud called ""cloaking"", whereby malicious adverts are able to get past a social media firm's review stage because the fraudsters have hidden their intentions. Meta says it is using what it has learnt about this technique to improve its automated detection systems. Read more stories on artificial intelligence Margaret (not her real name) is a retiree who lives in Buckinghamshire. She was recently conned out of £250 when she fell victim to fake advert on Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. She had been tempted to click on a link to a fictitious ITV article in which presenter Robert Peston (or rather, a scammer pretending it was him), chats about an investment opportunity he had come across. Margaret who trusts Mr Peston and the ITV brand decided to invest. In addition to paying the £250, Margaret sent off pictures of her passport, and both sides of her credit card. She immediately started getting phone calls. ""It was someone with an American accent welcoming me and saying my money was already making money,"" she tells me. The phone calls kept coming, as did a torrent of emails. Margaret became suspicious, particularly when they started asking her about her income and savings, and when she intended to invest more money. ""I contacted my bank and was refunded but it didn't stop the scammers."" Margaret still receives daily calls, and even started getting them from someone purporting to be from the US National Security Agency promising to help her investigate the scam. ""My own mental health is being impacted and I believe I am at risk, in particular identity theft and indeed potential monetary theft,"" she says. ""They are so mega persistent, and are dangerous pests."" It is an issue that UK consumer watchdog Which? has been looking into. ""Malicious advertisers may mask web links or impersonate trusted brands such as the BBC to evade online platforms' reporting systems, and people often don't know they're looking at a scam or a deepfake until it's too late,"" says Rocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy. ""It should not fall on consumers to protect themselves from this fraudulent content online. Ofcom must use its powers under the Online Safety Act [which was passed late last year] to ensure that online platforms are verifying the legitimacy of their advertisers to prevent scammers reaching consumers."" Ofcom said in a statement that tackling fraud ""is a priority"" for the regulator. ""The UK's new online safety laws will be an important part of making it harder for fraudsters to operate,"" it added. ""Under the new laws, online services will be required to assess the risk of their users being harmed by illegal content on their platforms - including fraud, take appropriate steps to protect their users, and remove illegal content when they identify it or are told about it."" Nicolas Corry is managing director at financial investigation firm Skadi. He says he was ""troubled"" by the amount of causal fraud occurring on Facebook and other social media sites. ""These companies are making vast amounts of profits, and exposing people to fraud,"" he adds. ""And then it's the finance companies that pay for this, or the victims themselves."" Mr Corry says social media firms should be more rigorously checking each advert, and its links, before they allow them to go up."

The Ivy League school said it was ditching the 15 May commencement in favour of smaller celebrations to focus on ""keeping them safe"". The New York City university said it had arrived at the decision after consultations with student leaders. Colleges across the US are bracing for disruptions at graduations amid pro-Palestinian protests. Columbia University said in a statement on Monday: ""Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families. ""They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers. ""As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly."" There have been demonstrations at nearly 140 colleges across 45 states and Washington DC since the protests started at Columbia University in mid-April, according to a BBC tally. About 2,500 people have been arrested at campuses nationwide, according to an Associated Press count. Last week, Columbia called in the police to clear pro-Palestinian protesters from its campus in Upper Manhattan, leading to more than 100 arrests. Demonstrators had occupied Hamilton Hall, renaming it Hind's Hall, after a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza. The college also sent in officers on 18 April to arrest more than 100 demonstrators who had pitched dozens of tents at the Morningside neighbourhood campus. The protesters have been calling for the college to divest from companies they say are profiting from the Israel-Gaza war, but a number of incidents of antisemitism have been reported during the unrest. Columbia has asked that New York police remain on campus until at least 17 May. Also on Monday, Harvard University's President Alan Garber warned protesters must end the encampments on campus or face suspension. Police in riot gear, meanwhile, arrested dozens of protesters while clearing a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California San Diego. Monday's raid came a day after police in Los Angeles cleared out a similar encampment at the University of Southern California (USC). No arrests were reported. In a statement on Sunday, USC President Carol Folt said action had to be taken because the situation was ""spiralling in a dangerous direction"". Also on Sunday, Northeastern University's graduation ceremony in Boston passed largely peacefully at the city's Fenway Park, with police on site. Members of the graduating class held Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian phrases. Other students waved Israeli flags. Similar demonstrations unfolded at the University of Michigan's commencement in Ann Arbor on Saturday. The University of Mississippi, meanwhile, is investigating a student accused of apparently making monkey sounds towards a black woman during protests on campus last week. The student's membership of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity has been revoked. Social media videos showed pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted down by a larger group of counter-protesters last Thursday. The college said it had opened an inquiry into ""actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones"". At Princeton University, at least 17 students said on Friday they would go on hunger strike until campus officials meet them to discuss divestment and a ""cultural boycott of Israel"". They are also demanding the New Jersey college reverse punishment of students after police last week arrested 13 individuals for trespassing during an attempted sit-in. The students were barred from campus and face disciplinary action including possible suspension or expulsion. Also on Friday, faculty members from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) condemned the handling of student protests. History department faculty members posted two letters condemning the administration after police last week swarmed the campus to clear an encampment. University of Virginia history professors, meanwhile, released an open letter condemning that institution after police arrested 25 people on Saturday on campus, where pro-Palestinian protesters had refused to remove an encampment."

Nationwide rallies - during which there have been hundreds of arrests - showed no sign of stopping over the weekend. At UCLA ""physical altercations broke out"" after a barrier separating the two sides was breached, an official said. The White House has insisted that demonstrations must remain peaceful. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told ABC that the US government respects the right of protesters demonstrating over the Israel-Gaza war. But he condemned antisemitic incidents that have been reported, as well as ""all the hate speech and the threats of violence out there"". At UCLA, a pro-Palestinian encampment has grown in size in recent days, as has a group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters. The Israeli American Council (IAC) organised the counter-protest. It recently said it had ""profound concern"" over the antisemitism reported elsewhere, including at Columbia University in New York City. Many pro-Palestinian protesters who spoke to the BBC there sought to distance themselves from antisemitic incidents. In some cases they have blamed outside agitators. A group of 21 Democratic members of Congress has called on Columbia to end what they call the ""unauthorized and impermissible encampment of anti-Israel, anti-Jewish activists on campus"", in a letter obtained by Axios. Similar calls for action had largely come from the Republican side of the political divide. In a fresh statement on Monday, Columbia head Dr Minouche Shafik said ""alternative internal options to end this crisis"" were under discussion, after talks between protest organisers and the university failed to result in a deal. At least some of the protesters involved in the disturbances at UCLA appeared to have come from outside the university, the Reuters news agency reported. The two groups remained peaceful until Sunday, when campus police with batons separated them as they pushed and shoved each other, and traded punches. It was not immediately clear which group broke through the barrier between them. ""We are heartbroken about the violence that broke out,"" the university said, adding that additional security measures had been introduced. Tensions flared at US universities after the 7 October Hamas attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed in Israel, and the retaliatory Israeli military assault that has killed more than 34,000 people in Gaza. In the last fortnight, a nationwide uprising has emerged which university officials and law enforcement have struggled to contain. They have blamed outside groups for infiltrating the demos. The movement seems to have been emboldened by the arrest of more than 100 protesters at Columbia after police were called to clear an encampment. Hundreds of people have since been arrested in locations across the US - many of whom had pitched their own tents on university grounds. The protests have also spread to Canada, with a pro-Palestinian camp of about 20 tents now installed in the grounds of Montreal's McGill University. Activists in both countries are demanding a ceasefire in the conflict, and that their universities - many with massive endowments - cut their financial ties, or divest, from Israel. They say that companies doing business in or with the nation of Israel are complicit in its ongoing war on Gaza - and so are institutions that invest in those companies. Officials in the US have also scrambled to tackle alleged incidents of antisemitism, with a number of Jewish students voicing fears for their safety. At several campuses, they have spoken of incidents ranging from chants and signs supporting Hamas - a proscribed terror group in the US - to physical altercations and perceived threats. Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, reported ""virulent antisemitic slurs"" in a statement on Saturday that accused ""professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern"" of infiltrating a student protest. More than 100 people were detained, it added. In other recent developments:"

Students in Leeds, Newcastle and Bristol set up tents outside university buildings, on Wednesday, and called for supporters to donate food, drinks and hygiene products. Elsewhere, student activists held marches and one-off protests. One camp, at Warwick University, has been set up in the town's piazza for a week. The UK protests follow much larger demonstrations on campuses across the US, most prominently at Columbia University, in New York. More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested in the US - dozens on Tuesday night, after police raided a Columbia building occupied by students for almost two weeks. Organisers of the Warwick protest said they had begun the occupation because the university had ""ignored"" previous demonstrations. ""After countless demonstrations, sit-ins, open letters and even a motion through our students union, the university hasn't even engaged with us, let alone met our demands,"" they said on a fundraising page. Warwick University said it was ""working to begin discussions"" with the protesters about their demands. ""We recognise our students and staff have a right to voice their opinions, as freedom of speech is a vital component of university life,"" it said. ""We are continuing to urge everyone to respect the views of others even when they are different to their own."" Protesters want their universities to divest from Israel in response to its deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. Divestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties. Lewi, who asked for his surname be withheld, told BBC News he had been at the Newcastle encampment since it had begun, at about 08:00 on Wednesday, and students across the country had coordinated their protests for roughly the same time. About 60 students and staff members were there, with more expected to join for a rally later in the day, he said. ""We've tried to be democratic since 10 October, when activism on campus began,"" Lewi said. ""And since then, we've had no luck. ""So now, we've resorted to an indefinite encampment until the university will enter negotiations with us."" Northumbria Police told BBC News there was ""a proportionate policing presence"" at the protest. Lewi said the UK protests, while influenced by the Columbia occupation, were distinct. ""What's happened at Columbia has obviously inspired us to a degree but we have been thinking about this for a while,"" he said, adding the police response to student protests in the UK was ""less heavy-handed generally than the US"". ""Thankfully we're able to have our free speech on campus to a degree. ""And we're able to have freedom of assembly. ""So while the thing in Columbia has inspired us, I think there is a slight difference in what we're both wanting."" Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

More than 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested, but the protests continue as universities prepare for graduation ceremonies in coming days. Since the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war. They are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment, for many of the protesters, means cutting those endowments' ties to Israeli companies or ones that do business with Israel. Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions. Student activists say that companies doing business in Israel, or with Israeli organisations, are complicit in its ongoing war in Gaza - as are colleges investing in those companies. University endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments. The encampments began last month, with dozens of students at Columbia University pitching tents on a campus lawn while the president of the New York City university testified before Congress about antisemitism. The police moved in a day later and detained the protesters, sparking a wave of action at other colleges across the US. Activists quickly set up camp again at Columbia and eventually moved into an academic building. The police were called in again due to vandalism and risks to public safety, the university said. More than 100 arrests were made as both the building and encampment were cleared. The escalating crisis at Columbia inspired similar protests and encampments across the country, including: The BBC has counted more than 130 colleges and universities in the US where protests or encampments have arisen in the past few weeks. Protests have occurred in 45 states and Washington D.C. Pro-Palestinian protesters have also gathered over the past week on university campuses in Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK. Some are negotiating with student activists while others are issuing ultimatums that have led to police being called in. An agreement was reached between Northwestern University near Chicago and protesters that limits the size of the encampment. Another deal was reached at Brown University where school officials agreed to hold a vote on divestment in October in exchange for students removing the encampment. National politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting antisemitic incidents at some protests. Jewish students at several campuses have told the BBC about incidents that made them feel uncomfortable or fearful. These ranged from chants and signs supporting Hamas, a proscribed terror group, to physical altercations and perceived threats. More than 2,000 people have been arrested at the demonstrations across the US, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press. In just the first two days of May alone, hundreds of arrests were made at campuses around the country, including Yale, Dartmouth, Stony Brook, Portland State, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Dallas. At UCLA, 210 people were taken into custody after police moved in on a pro-Palestinian encampment. In New York, 282 were arrested earlier this week after police cleared Columbia's Hamilton Hall - which had been occupied by protesters - as well as the encampment on campus. The figure includes detentions made at the nearby City College of New York. Pro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel. No US university has ever committed to the BDS framework, although some have cut specific financial ties in the past. While divestment would have a negligible impact, if any, on the war in Gaza, protesters say it would shed light on those who profit from war and help build awareness of their issue. In response, Israel has banned some BDS groups from entering the country. Activists at Columbia and elsewhere have highlighted the protests at the end of the 1960s against US involvement in the Vietnam War. Thousands were arrested and there were violent clashes with police. Four students in Ohio were killed in 1970 when the National Guard opened fire. The National Guard is not being deployed to the Gaza campus protests. Their deaths triggered a nationwide student strike and hundreds of universities closed. Graduation ceremonies across the US are kicking off this weekend and some protests are expected including at Indiana University and the University of Michigan. It remains to be seen exactly what demonstrations at commencements will look like. At the University of Southern California, the commencement ceremony was cancelled altogether because of the potential impact of protests. On Friday, the school announced it would host an event celebrating graduating students at the LA Memorial Coliseum."

Antony Blinken was speaking as a Hamas delegation discussed the new proposal with mediators from Egypt and Qatar. A source close to the talks told the BBC they were cautiously optimistic. The proposal includes a 40-day truce in return for the release of hostages and the prospect of displaced families being allowed back to northern Gaza. It reportedly also involves new wording on restoring calm meant to satisfy Hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire. The Hamas delegation has now left Cairo and will return with a written response to the proposal, Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera TV said. The Israeli government is coming under growing pressure from its global allies and the families of the hostages to agree a deal. Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. More than 34,480 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US have been attempting for weeks to broker a new agreement that would secure another pause in the fighting and the release of the 133 hostages who Israel says are still being held, at least 30 of whom are presumed dead. Earlier this month, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week truce and the release of 40 women, children and elderly or sick hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas said it was sticking to its demands for a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes. The source close to the talks in Cairo told the BBC that the new proposal from Israel was significantly different from previous offers. On Saturday, the Axios news website cited Israeli officials as saying the proposal included a willingness for the return of people to northern Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the east-west corridor that divides the territory and prevents freedom of movement. It also included a willingness to ""discuss the establishment of a sustainable ceasefire as part of the implementation of the second phase of the deal"", the officials said. Israeli officials and a diplomat meanwhile told the New York Times and Financial Times on Monday that Israel was also prepared to reduce the number of hostages released during the first phase to 33, down from 40. Hamas has only said publicly that it is studying the new Israeli proposal, but an unnamed senior official told AFP news agency on Sunday that ""the atmosphere is positive unless there are new Israeli obstacles"". ""There are no major issues in the observations and inquiries submitted by Hamas regarding the contents [of the proposal],"" they added. Mr Blinken also expressed optimism at a meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Riyadh, which was attended by several of his European and Arab counterparts. ""Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous, on the part of Israel. And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas,"" he said. ""They have to decide, and they have to decide quickly... And I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."" Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, whose country is a mediator in the Israel-Hamas negotiations along with Qatar, also said he was ""hopeful"". ""The proposal has taken into account the positions of both sides and has tried to extract moderation,"" he said. ""There are factors that will have an impact on both sides' decisions, but I hope that all will rise to the occasion."" Sunday's phone call between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have focused on the negotiations. They also discussed the need to sustain a recent increase in aid reaching Gaza and continued US opposition to a full-scale offensive on the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering. Local medics and rescuers said at least 22 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on three homes in Rafah overnight. ""We demand the entire world calls for a lasting truce. This is enough,"" a man called Abu Taha told AFP at al-Najjar hospital, as a crowd of relatives mourned over the shrouded bodies. There was no immediate comment on the reports from the Israeli military. Meanwhile, children in Rafah told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today radio programme that rising temperatures were making life unbearable in the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters erected there. ""Being inside the tent does not protect me from the intense heat; it is as if I am standing directly under sun's rays,"" said Sarah Abu Amr, 11. ""There is no electricity to power fans or get cold water to ease the terrible effect of the heat, and there is no food, water, or anything at all to keep us hydrated."" Last week, when temperatures reached 40C (104F), a five-month-old girl reportedly died in a tent due to the extreme heat, according to the UN . Over the weekend, there were further indications from senior Israeli generals that plans were being finalised for a major operation in Rafah, where the military says Hamas's remaining battalions and leaders are based. But Mr Blinken - who is due to fly from Saudi Arabia to Jordan and Israel - noted that the US had ""not yet seen a plan that gives us confidence that civilians can be effectively protected"". Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas - a rival of Hamas who is based in the occupied West Bank - said on Sunday that the US was the only country capable of preventing an assault on Rafah, which he warned would cause ""the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people"". Israeli Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that Israel's military would ""suspend the operation"" in Rafah if a hostage release deal was agreed. But far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich warned Mr Netanyahu not to cancel the Rafah assault, saying that if he failed to destroy Hamas ""the government headed by you will have no right to exist""."

Helen Day, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, has lovingly collected and researched the classic pocket-sized works for more than 20 years. She said the ""beautiful pictures"" that explained historical events and fairy tales ""had such a big impression on me as a child"". ""They were the backdrop of my childhood, used for school projects and given as birthday presents, they were just always there,"" she added. Ms Day, who now lives in Harpenden, said the touring exhibition first started in 2018 in Canterbury, but it was always her ambition to ""bring it home"". She said her devotion to the titles was instilled by her parents, who were both teachers. ""To me, they were beautiful pictures of the history of Elizabeth I, Nelson, fairy tales like Cinderella, they were the pictures that had such a big impression on me as a child,"" she added. Ms Day said she owned thousands of Ladybird books, but ""literally I do not know how many"". The books were originally printed by the Loughborough company, Wills & Hepworth, who then published the first volume under the Ladybird title in 1940. The small, illustrated books continued until the mid-1970s, when Ladybird was sold to Penguin Books, she said. The books' distinctive size came about during World War Two's paper shortages. ""Someone discovered if you took the largest sheet of paper, that was around at the time, and you laid it out really carefully and folded it and cut it really economically, you could make a small-sized children's book out of just one sheet of paper,"" Ms Day said. ""That's the accident that caused the magic of that Ladybird formula that so many of us will remember."" The durability of the cover was also part of its success, Ms Day added. ""They were strong little books, not only were they good quality, but they did not fall apart so they stayed on shelves for years and years and schools didn't throw them out and parents gave them to their kids, and so on and so on,"" Ms Day said. She cannot name her favourite book, but said that at the age of four she remembered it was Little Red Riding Hood, as she was given it as a birthday present. ""Most of the history books were about men, just a few were about women, so I spent my pocket money on those, I remember Elizabeth I becoming my heroine,"" she said.

The agreement signed on Monday says both countries will work together on developing ""robust"" methods for evaluating the safety of AI tools and the systems that underpin them. It is the first bilateral agreement of its kind. UK tech minister Michelle Donelan said it is ""the defining technology challenge of our generation"". ""We have always been clear that ensuring the safe development of AI is a shared global issue,"" she said. ""Only by working together can we address the technology's risks head on and harness its enormous potential to help us all live easier and healthier lives."" The secretary of state for science, innovation and technology added that the agreement builds upon commitments made at the AI Safety Summit held in Bletchley Park in November 2023. The event, attended by AI bosses including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and tech billionaire Elon Musk, saw both the UK and US create AI Safety Institutes which aim to evaluate open and closed-source AI systems. While things have felt quiet on the AI safety front since the summit, the AI sector itself has been extremely busy. Competition between the biggest AI chatbots - such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude - remains ferocious. So far the almost exclusively US-based firms behind all of this activity are still cooperating with the concept of regulation, but regulators have yet to curtail anything these companies are trying to achieve. Similarly, regulators have not demanded access to information the AI firms are unwilling to share, such as the data used to train their tools or the environmental cost of running them . The EU's AI Act is on its way to becoming law and once it takes effect it will require developers of certain AI systems to be upfront about their risks and share information about data used. This is important, after OpenAI recently said it would not release a voice cloning tool it developed due to ""serious risks"" the tech presents, particularly in an election year. In January, a fake, AI-generated robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden urged voters to skip a primary election in New Hampshire. Currently in the US and UK, AI firms are mostly regulating themselves. Currently, the majority of AI systems are only capable of performing single, intelligent tasks that would usually be completed by a human. Known as ""narrow"" AI, these tasks can range from quickly analysing data or providing a desired response to a prompt. But there are fears that more intelligent ""general"" AI tools - capable of completing a range of tasks usually performed by humans - could endanger humanity. ""AI, like chemical science, nuclear science, and biological science, can be weaponised and used for good or ill,"" Prof Sir Nigel Shadbolt told the BBC's Today programme. But the University of Oxford professor said fears around AI's existential risk ""are sometimes a bit overblown"". ""We've got to be really supportive and appreciative of efforts to get great AI powers thinking about and researching what the dangers are,"" he said. ""We need to understand just how susceptible these models are, and also how powerful they are."" Gina Raimondo, the US commerce secretary, said the agreement will give the governments a better understanding of AI systems, which will allow them to give better guidance. ""It will accelerate both of our Institutes' work across the full spectrum of risks, whether to our national security or to our broader society,"" she said. ""Our partnership makes clear that we aren't running away from these concerns - we're running at them."""
business,business,Neutral,"['The Bank of England', 'the Office for National Statistics', 'ONS', 'Budget', 'the Office for Budget Responsibility', 'OBR', 'National Insurance', 'OBR', 'OBR', 'OBR']","How much money is the UK government borrowing, and does it matter?",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50504151,2024-04-23,0.15506643364218609,Normal,False,Carbon emissions,"The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest - and that can influence wider tax and spending plans. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on their profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and in some years that happens. But if it can't, it will cover the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects - such as new railways and roads - which they hope will help the economy. The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments over the bond's lifetime. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The Bank of England has also bought hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of government bonds in the past to support the economy, through a process called ""quantitative easing"" . The amount the government borrows varies from month to month. For instance, when people submit tax returns in January, they often pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go, so the government sees a jump in the amount of money it takes in. So it is more helpful to look at the whole year, or the year-to-date. In the year to March, the government borrowed £120.7bn . While it was lower than the previous year, it was £6.6bn more than the government's forecaster predicted. Borrowing in March alone stood at £11.9bn, which was £4.7bn less than a year earlier. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about £2.7 trillion. That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year , known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. That current level is more than double what was seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up from those historic lows to its current level. But in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century, and also compared with some other leading economies. The larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay. That extra cost was not as big when the interest rates due were low through the 2010s, but it is more noticeable now that interest rates have been rising. Around a quarter of UK debt is index-linked, meaning payments are directly linked to the rate of inflation. Rising prices in the last two years have pushed up the bill for servicing debt significantly. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying its debts, it may mean it has less to spend on the public services which it borrowed to fund in the first place. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt fluctuates, and by one measure, hit a 20-year high in early October 2023 . The most significant figures tracking the cost of debt are published monthly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). According to this data, two months in 2022 saw record levels of money set aside for debt interest: £20.2bn in June and £18bn in December. June 2023 saw the third largest monthly amount - £13.1bn. The most recent figure for March revealed interest on government debt was £2.5bn. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has previously said the government will take ""difficult but responsible"" decisions on the public finances. He previously blamed the ""twin global emergencies of a pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine"" for driving up government costs. The chancellor has set a target of getting underlying debt to fall in five years' time. In the Budget in March, the chancellor said the government was on track to meet the debt target. The government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted that debt will fall as a share of the economy to 92.9% in 2028-29. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made reducing the national debt one of his five key promises and government finances will be a key focus in the run-up to a General Election. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run. With measures such as a cut in National Insurance announced at the March Budget, the OBR expects borrowing to rise slightly in the next financial year , before remaining in line with previous forecasts. It would fall below 3% of GDP by 2025-26, meeting one of the financial rules the government has decided to set itself. But the OBR has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions. In its latest forecasts in March, the OBR said debt, measured against the size of the economy, is still set to rise over the next four years, before falling back marginally in the fifth year. Other economists argue that big economies like the UK could borrow much more than they currently do , and the negative impact is greatly exaggerated. The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus."

It is the latest move in a years-long row over safety fears about the app which is owned by a Chinese company. Officials, politicians and security staff in many Western countries have been banned from installing it on work phones. So what are the three biggest cyber concerns about TikTok, and how does the company respond to them? TikTok says the app's data collection is ""in line with industry practices"". Critics frequently accuse TikTok of harvesting huge amounts of data. A cyber-security report published in July 2022 by researchers at Internet 2.0, an Australian cyber-company, is often cited as evidence. Researchers studied the app's source code and reported it carries out ""excessive data harvesting"". Analysts said TikTok collects details such as location, what specific device is being used and which other apps are on it. However, a similar test carried out by Citizen Lab concluded ""in comparison to other popular social media platforms, TikTok collects similar types of data to track user behaviour"". Similarly, a report by the Georgia Institute of Technology last year stated: ""The key fact here is that most other social media and mobile apps do the same things."" TikTok says the company is fully independent and ""has not provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we if asked"". Although it irks privacy experts, most of us accept that handing over swathes of private data is the deal we make with social networks. In exchange for giving us their services free of charge they gather knowledge about us and use it to sell advertising on their platform, or sell our data to other firms trying to advertise to us elsewhere on the internet. The issue that critics have with TikTok is that it is owned by Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, making it unique as a non-American mainstream app. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, for example, all collect similar amounts of data but are all US-founded companies. For years, US lawmakers, along with most of the rest of the world, have assumed a level of trust: that the data collected by these platforms will not be used for nefarious reasons which might put national security at risk. Donald Trump's 2020 executive order alleged TikTok's data collection could potentially allow China to ""track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage "". So far, evidence points to this being only a theoretical risk - but fears are stoked by a vague piece of Chinese law passed in 2017. Article seven of China's National Intelligence Law states that all Chinese organisations and citizens should ""support, assist and co-operate"" with the country's intelligence efforts. This sentence is often cited by people suspicious not just of TikTok, but all Chinese companies. However, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology argue this sentence is taken out of context, and note that the law also includes caveats protecting the rights of users and private companies. Since 2020, TikTok executives have repeatedly tried to reassure people that Chinese staff cannot access the data of non-Chinese users. But in 2022, ByteDance admitted that several of its Beijing-based employees did access the data of at least two journalists in the US and UK to track their locations and check whether they were meeting TikTok employees suspected of leaking information to the media. TikTok's spokeswoman says the employees who accessed the data were dismissed. The firm insists user data has never been stored in China and is building data centres in Texas for US user data, and at sites in Europe for data from its citizens. In the EU the company has also gone much further than any other social network and enlisted an independent cyber-security company to oversee all use of data at its European sites. TikTok says ""data of our European users is safeguarded in a specially designed protective environment, and can only be accessed by approved employees subject to strict independent oversight and verification."" TikTok argues that its community guidelines "" prohibit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public, which includes engaging in co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour"". In November 2022, Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told US lawmakers: ""The Chinese government could… control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations."" The claim has been repeated many times. Those concerns are further inflamed by the fact that TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - is heavily censored and reportedly engineered to encourage educational and wholesome material to go viral for its young user base. All social networks are heavily censored in China, with an army of internet police deleting content which criticises the government or excites political unrest. At the start of TikTok's ascendancy, there were high-profile cases of censorship on the app: a user in the US had her account suspended for discussing Beijing's treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. After a fierce public backlash, TikTok apologised and reinstated the account. Since then there have been few cases of censorship, other than the sort of controversial moderation decisions with which all platforms have to deal. Researchers at Citizen Lab carried out a comparison of TikTok and Douyin. They concluded that TikTok does not employ the same political censorship. ""The platform does not enforce obvious post censorship,"" researchers said in 2021. Georgia Institute of Technology analysts also searched for topics such as the independence of Taiwan or jokes about Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, and concluded: ""Videos in all of these categories can easily be found on TikTok. Many are popular and widely shared."" The overall picture, then, is one of theoretical fears - and theoretical risk. Critics argue TikTok is a ""Trojan horse"" - although it looks harmless, it could prove to be a powerful weapon during times of conflict, for example. The app is already banned in India, which took action in 2020 against the app and dozens of other Chinese platforms. But a US ban on TikTok could have a huge impact on the platform, since typically US allies often fall in step with such decisions. That was apparent when the US successfully led calls to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from being deployed in 5G infrastructure - again, based on theoretical risks. It is worth noting, of course, that these risks are a one-way street. China does not have to worry about US apps because access for Chinese citizens has been blocked for many years."

The BBC Arabic correspondent shares the harrowing moments he faced covering a war that pushed him to his limits. Warning: This report contains descriptions and images some readers may find distressing One of the worst moments of the past six months was the night we all slept on the street. I looked at the faces of my wife and children, huddled in the bitter cold in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and felt helpless. My 19-year-old twins, Zakia and Batoul, lay on the pavement alongside my daughter, Yumna, who is 14, my son Mohamed, who is eight and my youngest girl, Razan, aged five, with their mother, Zaynab. As we tried to rest outside the Palestinian Red Crescent Society's headquarters, the sounds of shelling echoed through the night and drones buzzed overhead. We had managed to find an apartment to rent, but the landlord had called earlier that day, saying the Israeli military had warned him the building would be bombed. I was working at the time, but my family grabbed their bags and fled. We met up at the Red Crescent headquarters, which was already overflowing with displaced people. My brother and I sat on cardboard boxes all night, discussing what we should do. We had fled our homes in the town of Jabalia a few days earlier, on 13 October, leaving most of our possessions behind, after the Israeli military told everyone in northern Gaza to move south for safety. And now we had just escaped being bombed in the area we had been told to move to. It was hard to think straight. I felt angry, humiliated and terrible that I could not provide any protection for my family. Eventually, my family moved to an apartment in Nuseirat in central Gaza, while I stayed with the BBC team in a tent at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. I visited every few days. Communication was difficult, with internet and phone signals sometimes cut. Once I did not hear from my family for four or five days. In Khan Younis, the BBC team - about seven of us - lived on one meal a day. Even when there was food, sometimes we did not eat it because there was hardly anywhere to go to the toilet. During this time my friend, Al Jazeera bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, suffered a terrible loss. The house his family had been staying in was hit in an Israeli air strike. His wife, teenage son, seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed. The Israeli military says it takes ""feasible precautions"" to reduce civilian casualties, and in this case had ""targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area"". Reporting Gaza: My War In Gaza, Palestinian journalists document the war as they live it on a daily basis. In this BBC World Service film, we hear the story of BBC Arabic's Reporter in Gaza, Adnan El-Bursh who found himself reporting the news, as he was living through it. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK) I watched the footage of my friend, who I have known for 20 years, embracing his children's shroud-wrapped bodies in central Gaza. I wished I was there with him. The news came amid a string of reports about the deaths of other friends, relatives and neighbours. My heart ached. I have now lost about 200 people in the war. That day I wept live on air, as I was reporting. In the night, I woke up with tears covering my cheeks. Wael's image never left my mind. I have covered conflicts in Gaza for 15 years, but this war stands apart, from the unprecedented attack that triggered it, to the scale of the losses. At 06:15 on 7 October I was woken by loud explosions and my children screaming. I went up to the rooftop and saw rockets being launched towards Israel from Gaza. When we realised Hamas had breached the fence into Israel - in its assault that saw about 1,200 people killed and 250 taken hostage - we knew the response from Israel would be like nothing we had seen before. More than 34,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The risk of injury and death has been ever-present. Two days into the war, I hurried to our local market in Jabalia, to stock up with food. It was busy with others doing the same. But the area was bombed heavily just 10 minutes after I left. The entire place was destroyed, including the large grocery store where I had shopped moments earlier. I knew the faces of the shop owners. Many of them were among the dead. Amnesty International says at least 69 people were killed in the attack and that it should be investigated as a war crime. The Israeli military has not responded to the BBC's question about this incident. Throughout the war it has said its operation is targeting Hamas, which it says operates from civilian locations. It also says ""strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law"". Before the war, Jabalia was a beautiful, tranquil town. I was born there and had been living a simple, contented life with my family, filled with love and plans for the future. I had a farm east of the town, where I had planted olive, lemon, and orange trees with my own hands. It was peaceful and I loved to drink tea there after work. The day we decided to flee northern Gaza for Khan Younis - leaving our homes and the BBC office in Gaza City behind - was a pivotal moment in my life. With more than 10 people crammed into one car, my family and I crawled our way south, along a single road, with tens of thousands of other people, on foot and in vehicles, all loaded with belongings. The journey was punctuated by air strikes on nearby areas on both sides of the road. Confusion, grief and uncertainty marked the faces of my family and the crowds. The children kept asking me: ""Where are we going? Will we be back tomorrow?"" I really wish I had taken our photo album, full of pictures of me as a young child, my parents, and my wife and I when we got engaged. My dad was an Arabic teacher and I also wish I had taken some of his books that I kept after he died. Later, I learned from a neighbour that my house had been completely destroyed, and my farm burned. After that terrifying and surreal journey south, and our night outside the Red Crescent headquarters, I continued working from Khan Younis for several weeks. My family were still in Nuseirat and being separated from them took a toll emotionally. Then, in early December, Israel began telling Gazans to leave parts of Khan Younis and move to other areas, including Rafah, further south. The Israeli military also closed the main road leading north, which connected me and my family. I did not know how I would get to them or where we should go if I did. Rafah was already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of people, and there was barely anywhere to stay. For days, I grappled with swirling emotions. News circulated about Israeli forces advancing towards the main roads, apparently aiming to divide the south from the central and northern regions.  I was terrified that I - or my family - would be killed and we would never see each other again. For the first time I felt like I had lost it. I did not even know what day it was. I considered stopping work and returning to my family. If we died, we would die together. In the end, on 11 December, I drove with a colleague along a back road to Nuseirat. When I arrived, my youngest children rushed up to hug me, with Razan reaching round my neck and holding on tight. We managed to move the family to Rafah. The BBC team had also relocated there, continuing to report. There were some awful moments. In late December, I reported as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) handed about 80 bodies to the authorities in Gaza. The IDF said it had taken them from Gaza to Israel so they could be checked to see if there were any hostages among them. A large lorry drove into the cemetery in the Rafah area. The stench was overwhelming when the container was opened. Men in aprons and masks placed the remains, wrapped in blue plastic, in a mass grave dug by an excavator in the sandy ground. I had never seen a scene like that before. It is hard to describe how horrible it was. Then, in January, I was reporting from a hospital in Rafah when several bodies were brought in, including another of Wael Al-Dahdouh's sons, Hamza, his eldest, who was also a journalist working for Al Jazeera. Who would tell Wael? It just seemed impossible, after the tragedies he had already faced. I could not even listen as one of my colleagues called someone close to Wael to pass on the news. Hamza and his colleague, freelance videographer Mustafa Thuraya, were killed in an Israeli air strike on their car, after they had reported on the aftermath of another strike in the area. The Israeli military alleges they were ""members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations"". The families and Al Jazeera reject the claims as false. The IDF says the two were operating drones ""posing an imminent threat to IDF troops"", but a Washington Post investigation ""found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day"". More than 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to Reporters Without Borders - the vast majority are known to be Palestinian. The IDF says it ""has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists"". It says it ""takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists"", but ""remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks"". Eventually, the news came that the BBC team's families had permission to leave Gaza. Four weeks later, we too finally left through the Rafah crossing, facilitated by the Egyptian authorities. I am writing this in Qatar. But I know that in Jabalia, they have been pulling up grass and grinding animal feed to eat, while I'm here having meals in a clean hotel. I find it hard to eat - it's like eating poison. The future is a blur. Gaza is my life. I want to return one day, but for now, that seems impossible."

Paul Freeman-Powell said he was told to park next to nearby grass because his car ""could explode."" The hospital says it has temporarily banned access to the car park while it improves its sprinkler system. But industry figures have challenged the decision, pointing to research that indicates petrol cars are considerably more likely to catch fire than EVs. Mr Freeman-Powell told the BBC he attempted to tell the security guard he spoke to that the hospital's policy did not make any sense. But he said in the end he complied because he did not want his seven-year-old son to miss an appointment he had waited nearly five years for. In a statement issued to the BBC, Alder Hey hospital said following advice from Merseyside Fire and Rescue it had ""temporarily restricted the parking of electric vehicles in one of our smaller car parks while we upgrade its fire sprinkler system."" ""Electric vehicles are still able to park in our main Hospital car park"", it continued, pointing out it also had 14 spaces with EV charging points. Merseyside Fire and Rescue has been contacted for comment. Mr Freeman-Powell shared a picture of a sign at the entrance to the car park which reads “no electric vehicles” on X, formerly Twitter. Fair Charge, a campaign group for electric vehicles, described it as “misinformation erroneously shaping public policy”. Its founder, the motoring journalist Quentin Willson, said ""for the NHS to restrict electric cars from coming into car parks dramatically conflicts with the clean air and health benefits from zero tailpipe emissions."" Colin Walker, head of transport at the research group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, agreed that the evidence did not support the hospital's position. “Data from EV FireSafe, which is backed by the Australian Government, indicates that petrol cars are over 80 times more likely to set on fire than EVs,” he told the BBC. He also highlighted a report released last year from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency which found that in 2022 there was an average of 3.8 fires per 100,000 electric and hybrid cars, and 68 fires per 100,000 cars of all fuel types, with these figures including arson. “It’s important that drivers understand the relative risks"", Mr Walker said, He also pointed out that a recent car fire which closed Luton Airport was started by a vehicle running on diesel fuel, not electric as some initial reports claimed. Electric car sales have slowed this year, comprising just 15% of new cars registered in the UK in March 2024, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The US EV maker Tesla reported a drop in revenue for the first time since 2021, and has been cutting jobs, with co-founder Elon Musk saying the firm had to be “absolutely hardcore” about reducing costs."

Peterborough's Nene Valley Railway (NVR) has launched a fundraiser to get the railway back on track. Running for 7.5 miles through the countryside and city, NVR is campaigning to raise £300,000 which will help maintain operations, conduct essential repairs and embark on vital infrastructure upgrades and restoration projects for the railway's long-term viability. It said rising operating costs, the current economic climate and dwindling passenger numbers since the pandemic had led to ""stark financial challenges"". For the last 40 years, NVR has offered visitors an immersive journey through time aboard meticulously restored steam and diesel locomotives. Michael Purcell, its chairman, said: ""Nene Valley Railway is more than just a railway attraction - it's a community of volunteers, a legacy, and a symbol of our industrial heritage. ""We are calling upon all those who cherish the heritage and charm of Nene Valley Railway to join us in this crucial effort. Your contributions will not only help us weather the current storm but will ensure that the railway can continue to inspire and delight our visitors and volunteers for years to come."" Brian Pearce, from volunteer-led Railworld Wildlife Haven nature reserve, which is next to the NVR's Peterborough station, urged more people and passengers to get behind the railway. ""I have been a member for 50 years. See how far we have come with the railway, with the museum. It's a great asset for Peterborough,"" he said.

Damage to a major supplies depot has also severely disrupted repairs. The lack of clean water and flows of untreated sewage pose a serious threat to health, say aid agencies. The Israel Defense Forces told the BBC that Hamas cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes. The destruction comes despite Israel's duty to protect critical infrastructure under the rules of war, unless there is evidence sites are being used for military reasons, say human rights lawyers. Clean water has always been a limited resource in Gaza and the territory has largely relied on a system of boreholes and desalination plants for its supply. Our analysis found that more than half of these vital facilities have been damaged or destroyed since Israel launched its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas attacked on 7 October. We also found that four of the six wastewater treatment plants - crucial to preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease - have been damaged or destroyed. The two others have shut down because lack of fuel or other supplies, according to one aid agency. The plants were among more than 600 water and sanitation facilities that we analysed, using a list of locations provided by Gaza's Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU). In one satellite image, of Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, two damaged large water storage tanks can be seen. The destruction of water and sanitation facilities has led to ""disastrous health consequences for the population"", said Dr Natalie Roberts, executive director of Medecins Sans Frontieres UK. ""The rates of diarrhoeal disease have gone catastrophically high,"" she said. In very severe cases, such disease can kill young children and the vulnerable. Rates of hepatitis A - found in contaminated water and particularly dangerous for pregnant women - are also high, according to the charity. ""This is killing people,"" Dr Roberts said. There is a particular spike in disease in Rafah in the south where many Gazans have fled to, Dr Roberts said, and a risk of cholera. There has been widespread damage to buildings across Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. According to the UN, about 69,000 housing units have been destroyed and a further 290,000 damaged. Homes are now ""very unlikely"" to have running water, according to aid workers we spoke to. To carry out this analysis we sought advice from experts at the UN and Human Rights Watch on the best approach. For each site, we sourced the most recent high resolution satellite imagery and compared each shot with an image taken prior to 7 October. We then marked a facility as destroyed or damaged if the closest structure to the given co-ordinates appeared to be reduced to rubble, partially collapsed, or showed other signs of damage. BBC Verify has not distinguished between ""destroyed"" and ""damaged"" facilities. This is because without knowing the precise outline of each facility, we cannot say whether it has been partly damaged or completely destroyed. Water wells usually consist of an underground borehole and electric pump, together with a small control room above ground. However, as the control room is not always visible or easily identifiable we had to rely on analysing the nearest visible buildings when assessing damage. Of the 603 water facilities we analysed, 53% appeared to have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October. A further 43 facilities were in areas that showed some damage or where solar panels had been removed, but we were unable to determine whether the water facility itself had been damaged so these were not included in our analysis. The latest available satellite images were acquired in March and April, and our analysis has been ongoing since April. The majority of sites identified as destroyed or damaged are in northern Gaza or in the area around the southern city of Khan Younis. At one wastewater facility in Bureij, in the centre of the Strip, solar panels that power the plant had been obliterated and sewage treatment tanks appeared to have algae growing on the surface. Not all damage is visible from satellite images, so our analysis may have missed some affected facilities. Some sites also may not be fully operational due to a lack of fuel. For example, the Unicef desalination plant in Deir al-Balah - one of three large seawater facilities in Gaza - can only work at 30% capacity because of lack of fuel, Unicef told the BBC. With most Gazans now displaced from their homes, and living in tented camps, the build-up of sewage in the streets is even more of a threat. ""The pumps for sewage are not operating and the streets are flooded [with it],"" said Muhammad Atallah, who works for the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. The conflict has already made water facility repair difficult for Gaza's water authority, but a strike on a key maintenance warehouse has made it harder still. The building, in the neighbourhood of al-Mawasi, was severely damaged in a missile strike on 21 January. Four people died and 20 others were injured, according to the CMWU. Monther Shoblaq, the director general of CMWU, told the BBC this warehouse, which acted as a depot for both the CMWU and Unicef, contained more than 2,000 items used for maintenance, and was the heart of the water and sanitation services in Gaza. Its destruction has severely limited CMWU's ability to repair and maintain vital facilities such as water pipelines, he said. The IDF said the warehouse was not targeted, but that Hamas terrorists operating nearby were struck and ""it is possible that parts of the warehouse suffered damage as a result of the strike"". We gave the IDF a sample of five other damaged or destroyed water sites from our analysis. In one case, the IDF denied there had been an air strike, in the four other cases it said Hamas fighters or sites were the actual targets. ""Hamas stores its weapons and ammunition within these civilian structures, constructs terror infrastructure beneath them, and from them, launches its attacks… The IDF is locating and destroying these terror infrastructures, which have been discovered, among other places, in and near the water facilities in question."" Leila Sadat, a former special adviser on crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, told the BBC that facilities critical to the survival of civilians should be protected unless a military body has some concrete evidence to suggest otherwise. To assess war actions in terms of legality, you need to consider ""the pattern"" of those actions, she said. ""You can't just look strike by strike… [t]hey [the IDF] have hit water pipes, tanks, reservoirs, and infrastructure,"" she said. ""To take out over half of water and sanitation would be very difficult without intentionally doing so. So the pattern is evidence of either a reckless approach to civilian objects or the intentional destruction of them; these were not all mistakes,"" she added. In response to our findings, Sara Elizabeth Dill, an international criminal and human rights lawyer, said: ""What we are seeing is essentially siege warfare and the total destruction of Gaza, without regard for human life or human decency, or any attempts to comply with international law.""

Looking at the state of the world, you might wonder whether apes could possibly do a worse job of running things. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes presents a realm – and a film – almost free of humans, and while that ape-dominant planet is not necessarily worse, it's definitely no improvement. Same old quest for power, same old questions about whom to trust, and unfortunately same old movie. Kingdom follows the hit franchise that was rebooted in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes and became a trilogy featuring Caesar, an intelligent, peaceful leader of the apes played by Andy Serkis. Brilliant, expressive motion capture was used to create lifelike CGI animals. Wes Ball, the director of the Maze Runner trilogy, has stepped into this series with an instalment that is not quite a reboot but that takes a leap in time, with different characters, signalling a new turn. Whatever you call it, this all-action spectacle relies on the same dazzling motion-capture but adds nothing fresh or especially interesting. The new story is set so many generations after Caesar's death that Noa, the ape-hero played by Owen Teague (It), has no idea who he was even though he has benefitted from Caesar's legacy. Noa's village is a calm, wooded place where the simian villagers have built treehouses out of branches. They haven't figured out technology, but they have a much better grasp of the English language than before. Now they speak in complete sentences. What they say in those sentences is pretty dull, though. Even an ape movie can use some character development and a decent screenplay, and while Teague does a fine job of making the gentle-voiced, soulful-eyed young Noa seem alive, his coming-of-age journey is no match for Caesar's civilising project. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes Director: Wes Ball Cast: Owen Teague, Freya Allan, Kevin Durand, Peter Macon Run time: 2hr 25m In the film's first big action set piece, Noa's village is attacked by marauding apes on horseback wearing rusted face masks and carrying torches and taser-like spears. The scene is deftly orchestrated to let us share Noa's horror as they set fire to his village and take any survivors prisoner. The kinetic scene proves how well Ball uses the technology, and if all you need is apes in action, there is plenty of that throughout. After the attack, Noa vows to his slain father that he will bring the prisoners home, and sets off on a typical, too-familiar hero's journey, being brave and learning some lessons. His first lesson is from a wise orangutan, Raka (Peter Macon), who teaches him what Caesar believed: ""Apes together strong. Ape not kill ape."" Good luck with that. The masked riders are led by a power-mad ape who wears a crown and calls himself Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). He has adopted the original Caesar's mottos but uses them as a veil for his dictatorial regime. More like this: Anyone looking for an analogy with authoritarian trends today will have a hard time, though. The screenplay is so flat it's kind of an insult to the apes' intelligence. And they are smart. In this world, the virus that made Caesar and other apes brainy has spread to humans, with the opposite effect. We are now stupider than ever and unable to speak. One exception is Mae (Freya Allan), a young woman Noa and Raka meet as they head toward Proximus' settlement. She doesn't have much of a character herself, and mostly stands for the question of whether apes and humans can trust each other and coexist. William H Macy, the film's other human character, has a small role as a man who has survived being captured by Proximus by reading books to him, a skill the apes have not yet mastered. If you have seen War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), the final instalment of the Caesar trilogy, you might be astonished at how derivative the last stretch of Kingdom is. Once again, a ruthless leader holds apes prisoner in an abandoned weapons depot. This time everything is rusted from age and the ruler is Proximus instead of Woody Harrelson's Colonel, but still. They couldn't come up with anything better to cause the inevitable explosion? Behind the impressive CGI, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the definition of generic, all two hours and 25 minutes of it. The ending teases a sequel that offers a more intriguing conflict ahead, but that doesn't help us now. ★★☆☆☆ If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The government announced last year that it will stop building new stretches of these roads, following concerns about cost and safety. Smart motorways were designed to ease traffic flow, with some using the hard shoulder as an extra lane. Technology is used to regulate traffic flow and ease congestion. As of April 2024 there were 396 miles of smart motorways in England: All three types of smart motorway use overhead gantries to direct drivers. Variable speed limits, controlled by speed cameras, manage traffic flow when there is congestion, or if there is a hazard ahead. On dynamic motorways, the overhead gantries also tell drivers whether or not they can drive on the hard shoulder. A red X is displayed if a lane is closed, for example, because of an accident or breakdown. Traffic is monitored using CCTV. All-lane-running schemes operate in the same way, except there is no hard shoulder at all. If drivers get into trouble, they are meant to aim for emergency refuge areas (essentially lay-bys) at intervals along the road. Motorways in general account for far fewer casualties than rural or urban roads. And National Highways, which manages England's motorways, says the latest data shows that ""smart motorways are our safest roads"". However, the removal of the hard shoulder on some smart motorways has concerned critics. If a vehicle breaks down, or if there is an accident, vehicles can be left stranded and emergency services may struggle to get through. National Highways' latest figures suggest that if you break down on a smart motorway without a hard shoulder you are three times more likely to be killed or seriously injured than on one with a hard shoulder. Across all smart motorways, radar and cameras are supposed to spot broken-down vehicles, and warning signs are then supposed to close affected lanes. However, in April, figures obtained by Panorama revealed hundreds of incidents when crucial safety equipment was out of action. National Highways says radar detects 89% of stopped vehicles - but that means one in 10 is not spotted. At least 79 people have been killed on smart motorways since they were introduced in 2010. In the past five years, seven coroners have called for them to be made safer. In 2021, MPs on the Transport Committee said they were ""not convinced"" that the benefits of all-lane-running motorways were enough to justify the safety risks of permanently removing the hard shoulder. Then, in January 2022, the rollout of new stretches of all-lane-running was paused for five years, in order to collect more information and make existing schemes safer. Ministers have since gone further, and in 2023 cancelled the building of new smart motorways - this included 11 schemes that were already on pause and three earmarked for construction. However, work on some stretches of smart motorway that were near completion were allowed to continue. In 2020, the government promised to build more emergency refuges - safety lay-bys that motorists can use if they are in trouble. Although 150 are supposed to be built by next year, only 13 have been completed so far. National Highways says a further 34 refuges are under construction. The government says it is also spending £900m on technology to make the existing network safer, but there are no plans to put back the hard shoulder."

One of them was subsequently shot and killed for protesting against eviction. The Saudi government and Neom management refused to comment. Neom , Saudi Arabia's $500bn (£399bn) eco-region, is part of its Saudi Vision 2030 strategy which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil. Its flagship project, The Line, has been pitched as a car-free city, just 200m (656ft) wide and 170km (106 miles) long - though only 2.4km of the project is reportedly expected to be completed by 2030. Dozens of global companies, several of them British, are involved in Neom's construction. The area where Neom is being built has been described as the perfect ""blank canvas"" by Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. But more than 6,000 people have been moved for the project according to his government - and UK-based human rights group ALQST estimates the figure to be higher. The BBC has analysed satellite images of three of the villages demolished - al-Khuraybah, Sharma and Gayal. Homes, schools, and hospitals have been wiped off the map. Col Alenezi, who went into exile in the UK last year, says the clearance order he was asked to enact was for al-Khuraybah, 4.5km south of The Line. The villages were mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe, who have inhabited the Tabuk region in the country's north-west for generations. He said the April 2020 order stated the Huwaitat was made up of ""many rebels"" and ""whoever continues to resist [eviction] should be killed, so it licensed the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home"". He dodged the mission on invented medical grounds, he told the BBC, but it nevertheless went ahead. Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti refused to allow a land registry committee to value his property, and was shot dead by Saudi authorities a day later, during the clearance mission. He had previously posted multiple videos on social media protesting against the evictions. A statement issued by Saudi state security at the time alleged al-Huwaiti had opened fire on security forces and they had been forced to retaliate. Human rights organisations and the UN have said he was killed simply for resisting eviction. The BBC was not able to independently verify Col Alenezi's comments about lethal force. But a source familiar with the workings of the Saudi intelligence directorate told us the colonel's testimony - regarding both how the clearance order was communicated and what it said - was in line with what they knew about such missions more generally. They also said the colonel's level of seniority would have been appropriate to lead the assignment. At least 47 other villagers were detained after resisting evictions, many of whom were prosecuted on terror-related charges, according to the UN and ALQST. Of those, 40 remain in detention, five of whom are on death row, ALQST says. Several were arrested for simply publicly mourning al-Huwaiti's death on social media, the group said. Saudi authorities say those required to move for The Line have been offered compensation. But the figures paid out have been much lower than the amount promised, according to AlQst. According to Col Alenezi, ""[Neom] is the centrepiece of Mohamed Bin Salman's ideas. That's why he was so brutal in dealing with the Huwaitat."" A former senior executive of Neom's ski project told the BBC he had heard about the killing of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti a few weeks before leaving his native US for the role in 2020. Andy Wirth says he repeatedly asked his employers about the evictions, but was not satisfied with the answers. ""It just reeked of something terrible [that] had been exacted upon these people… You don't step on their throats with your boot heels so you can advance,"" he said. He left the project less than a year after joining it, disenchanted with its management. A chief executive of a British desalination company who pulled out of a $100m (£80m) project for The Line in 2022 is also extremely critical. ""It might be good for some high-tech people living in that area, but what about the rest?"" said Malcolm Aw, the CEO of Solar Water PLC. The local population should be seen as valuable assets, he added, given how well they understand the area. ""You should seek that advice to improve, to create, recreate, without removing them."" Displaced villagers were extremely reluctant to comment, fearing that speaking to foreign media could further endanger their detained relatives. But we spoke to those evicted elsewhere for another Saudi Vision 2030 scheme. More than a million people have been displaced for the Jeddah Central project in the western Saudi Arabian city - set to include an opera house, sporting district, and high-end retail and residential units. Nader Hijazi [not his real name] grew up in Aziziyah - one of approximately 63 neighbourhoods affected by those demolitions. His father's home was razed in 2021, for which he received less than a month's warning. Hijazi says the photos he had seen of his former neighbourhood were shocking, saying they evoked a warzone. ""They're waging a war on people, a war on our identities."" Saudi activists told the BBC of two individuals arrested last year in connection with the Jeddah demolitions - one for physically resisting eviction, the other for posting photos of anti-demolition graffiti on his social media. And a relative of a detainee in Jeddah's Dhahban Central Prison said they had heard accounts of a further 15 people being held there - reportedly for staging a farewell gathering in one of the neighbourhoods marked for demolition. The difficulty of contacting those inside Saudi prisons means we have not been able to verify this. ALQST surveyed 35 evicted people from Jeddah neighbourhoods. Of those, none say they had received compensation, or sufficient warning, in accordance with local law, and more than half said they had been forced out of their homes under threat of arrest. Col Alenezi is now based in the UK but still fears for his security. He says an intelligence officer told him that he would be offered $5m (£4m) if he attended a meeting at London's Saudi embassy with the Saudi interior minister. He refused. We put this allegation to the Saudi government but they did not respond. Attacks on critics of the Saudi government living abroad are not without precedent - the most high-profile being that on US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, murdered by Saudi agents inside the country's Istanbul consulate in 2018. A damning US intelligence report concluded Mohamed Bin Salman approved the operation. The crown prince has denied any role. But Col Alenezi has no regrets about his decision to disobey orders regarding Saudi's futuristic city. ""Mohamed Bin Salman will let nothing stand in the way of the building of Neom…I started to become more worried about what I might be asked to do to my own people.""

The company, which is under pressure as audiences move away from traditional pay-TV and cinema, said it was on track to meet its goals after new subscribers and price rises helped to narrow losses in its streaming business. Disney+ gained more than six million subscribers globally between January and March, excluding India. The streaming service now has more than 117 million subscribers. The increase is important for a service that has seen growth flag in recent months but is viewed as critical to Disney's future. However, Disney's share price tumbled by more than 8% with investors remaining wary of its prospects. Disney told investors that a planned password crackdown, which will start in some countries this summer and roll out globally in September, should help drive subscriber sign-ups in the months ahead. It is also hoping a number of sequels bring fans to the box office. Disney has follow-ups to its Moana and Inside Out movies as well as sequels for Planet of the Apes and Deadpool. Chief executive Bob Iger, whom Disney brought out of retirement in 2022 to boost profits and investor confidence, admitted that the company was ""swinging back a bit to lean on sequels"" after a period in which some of its new films flopped. ""Given the competition in the overall movie market, there's a lot of value in sequels obviously because they're known and cost less in terms of marketing,"" he said. Mr Iger added that the company would strike a ""balance"" with new films, while cutting back on Marvel films and television shows to ensure what is produced is higher quality. Disney's sprawling empire, which includes news stations, sports-focused ESPN as well as theme parks and cruise lines beyond its film and television studio, has been buffeted by changes in the entertainment industry. Mr Iger recently fended off a campaign by investment groups, which had accused the company of being slow to respond. In the most recent quarter, revenues in Disney's traditional television business continued to drop, falling 8%, as subscribers cancelled and advertising declined. But Mr Iger said his turnaround plan was working, noting that Disney+ reported an operating profit of $47m in the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $587m in the same period a year ago. Including ESPN+ and Hulu, home to hits such as Shogun, operating losses for its streaming businesses narrowed to $18m in the quarter from $659m a year ago. “It’s extremely rare in streaming to hear the word ‘profitable’ but Disney finally achieved it, kind of,"" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester. ""This is a big turning point for Disney and for the streaming market in general so long as content quality and frequency don’t get compromised,"" he added. Revenue in the company's experiences division, which includes its theme parks and cruise lines, grew 10%. It warned investors that it was seeing signs that travel was moderating from the post-Covid boom, but said it expected growth to rebound later this year. Overall, the company said revenue rose about 1% to $22.1bn. It reported an overall loss of $20m, which was affected by a $2bn charge related to the merger deal it struck for its business in India, which has struggled after it lost key rights to show certain cricket matches."

""It's going to make America safer, it's going to make the world safer,"" he said after signing the bill into law. The president said the US would ""right away"" send fresh weapons and equipment to Ukraine to help Kyiv fend off Russian advances. He spoke a day after the US Senate approved the aid package following months of congressional gridlock. Ukraine has recently stepped up its calls for Western assistance as Russia makes steady gains in its invasion. Included in the package is $61bn in military aid for Ukraine. It passed the Senate in a bipartisan vote of 79-18. Tuesday evening's approval came after the measure passed the US House of Representatives on Saturday. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""After more than six months of hard work and many twists and turns in the road, America sends a message to the entire world: we will not turn our back on you."" Reacting to the vote, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it ""reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and leader of the free world"". The Senate passed a similar aid package in February, but a group of conservatives who oppose new Ukraine support had prevented it from coming to a vote in the House of Representatives. Last week, Democrats and Republicans in the lower chamber joined together to bypass this opposition. They ultimately agreed to a package bill that included the foreign aid as well as legislation to confiscate Russian assets held by Western banks; new sanctions on Russia, Iran and China; and a provision that will force the Chinese company ByteDance to sell the popular social media service TikTok. In the House on Saturday, a majority of Republicans in the chamber voted against the foreign aid package. The bill also faced resistance among a handful of Senate Republicans who opposed any new aid to Ukraine. Fifteen voted with two Democrats - as well as independent Senator Bernie Sanders who objected to providing new offensive weapons to Israel - against the bill. ""Pouring more money into Ukraine's coffers will only prolong the conflict and lead to more loss of life,"" Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville said in remarks on Tuesday. ""No-one at the White House, the Pentagon, or the state department can articulate what victory looks like in this fight."" The aid package is expected to provide a significant boost to Ukraine's forces, which have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defence systems in recent months. On Tuesday, Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, faced the latest in a series of recent drone and missile strikes, with authorities saying two people in a residential neighbourhood were injured. The commander of Ukraine's National Guard, Oleksandr Pivnenko, said he was expecting an attempt by Russian forces to advance on the city, which is near the Russian border. Between February 2022 and January 2024, the US gave Ukraine more than $40bn in military aid, according to German research organisation, the Kiel Institute. The foreign aid package passed on Tuesday also allocates $17bn to Israel, as well as $9bn for civilians suffering in conflict zones around the world, including Palestinians in Gaza. A further $8bn has been earmarked for allies in the Asia-Pacific, including Taiwan, to ""counter communist China"". Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reacted to the vote by thanking congressional leaders for their ""unwavering commitment to Israel's security"". ""Israel and the United States stand together in the fight against terrorism, defending democracy and our shared values,"" he said. The US already provides Israel with $3.8bn in military aid each year. Over in Asia, a Chinese government spokeswoman called the military aid for Taiwan a ""serious violation of the one-China principle"" that would ""send the wrong signal to the pro-independence separatist forces"" in Taiwan. ""We urge the US to take practical actions to fulfil its commitment not to support Taiwan independence by not arming Taiwan in any way,"" she said. Taiwan's incoming President William Lai said the aid package would ""strengthen deterrence against authoritarianism"". Taiwan is a self-governing island and considers itself distinct from China, but Beijing views it as a breakaway province and hopes to bring it back under its own control. The national security package also includes a provision that could lead to a nationwide ban on TikTok. The popular social media app's China-based parent company has nine months to sell its stake and find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down across the US. The statute gives the US president the option of extending the deadline by an additional 90 days, which means the latest the ban could take effect is nearly a year from now. The TikTok provision drew bipartisan support, with lawmakers arguing that the Chinese government could invoke security laws to compel ByteDance to hand over data about the app's estimated 170 million US users. TikTok has repeatedly said it has not provided, and would not provide, its foreign user data to the Chinese government. On Saturday, the House of Representatives held a separate vote on a border-security bill that included conservative priorities, but it did not garner the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome a procedural hurdle. In the Senate, several Republicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, voted against the Ukraine aid package because it did not include increased funding for US border security. Mr Cruz called it one of the toughest votes of his congressional career, but that the US needed to address the immigration issue first. ""I can't continue to allocate funds to secure Ukraine's border before we secure our own,"" Mr Cruz said. In February, a group of Democratic and Republican senators proposed a foreign aid package that included significant immigration policy reforms and additional funding. That effort collapsed, however, after former President Donald Trump and his congressional allies said the changes were not enough."

The issue had sparked controversy , with critics noting the names of other cities do not prompt flag emojis to appear. Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city. Apple previously told the BBC the flag's appearance when Jerusalem was typed had been inadvertent. The issue, according to Apple, related to unintended behaviour in a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps. Users noticed the flag started being suggested after the company rolled out iOS 17.4.1 - the latest publicly available version of the software on which its mobile devices run. Critics such as TV presenter Rachel Riley had demanded Apple explain why the flag appeared, particularly when other cities do not produce flag emojis when typed. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism,"" she wrote on social media . Apple's apparent resolution is currently only in the ""developer beta"" version of iOS 17.5 released on Tuesday. The Apple Developer Programme allows programmers building apps to sign up for early releases of the software - called beta versions - so they can test out apps they are building on them. In the new update no emoji is suggested when a user types ""Jerusalem"", in line with what happens with other cities. It's not clear when the update will be released more widely, either as a public beta, or as an finished update to the general public. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967. They have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. There have been increased tensions in the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed 33,729 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."

Staff at 16 train companies will take part in rolling one-day walkouts between 7 and 9 May over pay and working conditions. An overtime ban will also take place between 6 and 11 May. Passengers are advised to check before they travel, with the action likely to lead to delays and cancellations. The Bank Holiday falls on 6 May this year. Aslef, the train drivers' union, said it is seeking better pay for its members and claimed drivers are being asked to sacrifice working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Drivers from several train companies will strike on different days. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, the body that negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, said: ""This wholly unnecessary strike action called by the Aslef leadership will sadly disrupt customers and businesses once again, while further damaging the railway at a time when taxpayers are continuing to contribute an extra £54m a week just to keep services running. ""We continue to seek a fair agreement with the Aslef leadership which both rewards our people, gives our customers more reliable services and makes sure the railway isn't taking more than its fair share from taxpayers."" Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary, said: ""It is now a year since we sat in a room with the train companies - and a year since we rejected the risible offer they made and which they admitted, privately, was designed to be rejected."" Little progress has been made in solving the row between Aslef and the rail companies since the union first started striking in July 2022. The most recent pay deal was rejected almost a year ago in April 2023. The offer included 4% pay rises for two years in a row, on condition that drivers would accept industry-wide changes to training, and negotiate changes to work patterns at individual operators. The last series of train strikes took place during the first and second weeks of April. However, a London Underground drivers' strike scheduled for Monday 8 April and Saturday 4 May was called off. A spokesperson for Aslef said at the time that ""key issues"" had been ""successfully resolved"" in the London Underground dispute ""without the need for strikes"". The train drivers' dispute is stuck on repeat. And passengers are left in the middle of a standoff with no current end in sight. Each time a new strike is announced, the government insists the offer which Aslef's committee rejected a year ago should be put to members in a vote. Ministers and the industry group which does the negotiating say any deal has to be fair to be taxpayers, who put billions in subsidies into the railway every year. Aslef argues those proposals, especially with strings attached to a pay rise, were never going to be acceptable to its members. It thinks a better offer should be put forward. The government wants to cut costs and the industry argues proposed changes would also increase reliability. But from Aslef's perspective, members are being asked to give up too much by way of terms and conditions, for the pay rise that's on offer. Train drivers have kept voting for more industrial action. So, the strikes keep coming. It is difficult to see a resolution coming before the general election. And whoever's in government after that, it's not clear what they would do differently to end the dispute."

SSEN's East Coast project includes plans for a new substation and overhead power lines between the villages of Kintore in Aberdeenshire and Tealing in Angus. On Sunday, 25 farmers took their tractors along a 15-mile stretch of the proposed network, calling the plans ""devastating"". SSEN said the work was necessary to meet climate change targets. The ""tractor run"" travelled through Durris, Drumoak, Echt and Dunecht to Leylodge near Kintore, where a new substation is set to be built. Supporters also lined part of the route. Eileen West from the campaign group Deeside Against Pylons said it would be ""difficult"" for the farmers to work around the pylons. She added: ""They'll have to be very careful about their own safety, of their machinery going around them. ""They all turned up on a pretty grim day, the farmers are all behind on their crops, but for them to turn up on a day like this shows the appetite for protest."" Plans were overturned last year that would have seen the pylons located across land at the heart of the classic novel Sunset Song. Residents in the area objected to the original plans on both environmental and cultural grounds. In a statement SSEN Transmission said: ""The Kintore-Tealing 400kV overhead line project is part of a GB-wide upgrade of the electricity transmission network that is required to deliver energy security and net zero. ""We are committed to work with all stakeholders to minimise and mitigate environmental, community and land use impacts."""

Brian Altman KC told the Post Office Horizon inquiry on Wednesday that he ""didn’t turn a blind eye to anything"". But he admitted with hindsight, the Post Office should have disclosed the information to subpostmasters. Mr Altman knew after his appointment in August 2013 that Gareth Jenkins, an expert witness, had failed to disclose information about bugs in the Horizon IT system to defendants. That information might have helped subpostmasters who had been found guilty to challenge their convictions. Soon after his appointment, Mr Altman, formerly the top barrister representing the government, read formal legal advice from Simon Clarke, a barrister with law firm Cartright King. This made it clear Gareth Jenkins had been in breach of his duties as an expert, and that that might be disclosable to subpostmasters convicted of theft and false accounting. However, he avoided meeting Mr Jenkins and did not advise the Post Office to investigate his evidence. Mr Clarke’s advice was not shown to defendants until 2021. The inquiry saw evidence that Mr Altman re-wrote the terms of reference of his review to remove issues of Gareth Jenkins’ evidence and avoided meeting him. He wrote to fellow lawyers for the Post Office at Bond Dickenson that he knew that not meeting Gareth Jenkins ""risks exposing the final report [of his review of convictions] to criticism"". ""This is something I shall need to think about carefully. At this very early stage I am not unnaturally undecided,"" he wrote. ""For now it may be better for the Terms of Reference to remain silent about him."" ""Why did you consider it best for the terms of reference to remain silent on Mr Jenkins?"" asked Jason Beer, counsel to the inquiry. “My view was if the terms if I had yet not yet resolved to see him, that there was no point sticking it in the terms of reference,” Mr Altman said. “Not meeting him would be turning a blind eye to a potentially useful source of information? That’s why you wouldn’t want to do it,” said Mr Beer. Mr Altman responded: “If you’re suggesting that I’m turning a blind eye, I was not turning a blind eye to anything.” Mr Beer also asked why Mr Altman didn’t advise the Post Office that it should investigate why Mr Jenkins had given evidence that was, according to Mr Clark, misleading and in breach of his duties to the court. “Because I come back to what I had thought… that the advice I was giving was about the impact of that failure on the prosecutions and the convictions - and not the reasons why he had failed to do it,” said Mr Altman. Mr Altman also admitted he did not ask whether Mr Jenkins had been properly instructed by the Post Office on his duties as an expert witness. Mr Beer: “Did you consider making a report to attorney general?” Mr Altman: “No.” “Or the [Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?]” “No.” “And I think you’ve said it didn’t cross your mind to advise to call in the police?” “No.” The inquiry saw evidence that Post Office lawyers were interested in hiring Mr Altman because of his political connections and because he ""had the ear"" of the Attorney General’s office. Post Office lawyers Rod Williams  and Gavin Matthews discussed on 25 July 2013 how Altman was a good candidate to review subpostmasters’ convictions because he was ""clearly [very] alive to the political dimension"". The inquiry continues."

It seems an unlikely choice of theme for fashion's event of the year. The title of JG Ballard's 1962 short story The Garden of Time has an elegiac romanticism to it. Images immediately stir, visions of flowers and vines springing forth. Depending on the bent of your imagination, those visions may err towards tidy blooms or overgrown thickets, perpetual splendour or the endless cycles of death and growth so necessary for even the smallest pocket of paradise. After all, a garden is time incarnate, bound by the slow march of the seasons. But what kind of garden is this? Do the normal rules of chronology apply? This year, fashion's annual extravaganza the Met Gala has taken Ballard's title as its dress code. The theme has been chosen to complement The Costume Institute's exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, an exploration of the many items held within the Met's archives that are now too fragile to be worn. Reanimated using technologies including X-rays, AI and soundscapes, these artefacts are interspersed with iconography related to the natural world, the combination promising to ""serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal."" It's an odd pairing. Perhaps asking the Gala's attendees to embark on further reading before they attend is setting them up to fail (see the various interpretations of ""camp"" in 2019 that would have had Susan Sontag smashing her Tiffany lamps in protest), but for anyone who does choose to dig deeper, the choice of Ballard's short story may prove puzzling. It relays the tale of Count Axel and his Countess wife who live in a magnificent hilltop villa, surrounded by their gardens. These gardens, where ""the air seemed brighter, the sun seemed warmer"" hold a series of ""time flowers"" – translucent growths with crystal hearts. When plucked, that crystal core dissolves, emitting the light trapped within. ""Strange shifts momentarily transformed the evening, subtly altering its dimensions of time and space,"" Ballard writes. ""The darkened portico of the house, its patina of age stripped away, loomed with a curious spectral whiteness as if suddenly remembered in a dream."" The flowers can slow the clock, but they cannot stop it. So far, so fitting for an exhibition concerned with historical clothing that embodies time without being immune to it. After all, garments are vulnerable, affected by heat, sweat, pressure, stains, moths, storage methods and so on. The job of the archivist is to attempt as much preservation as possible, suspending the usual process of decay even if it cannot be staunched entirely – conserving history so that future generations can maintain some connection with the products of the past. However, Count Axel is not picking his precious flowers for the thrill of it. On the horizon, an army advances, ""a vast confused throng of people, men and women, interspersed with a few soldiers in ragged uniforms, pressing forward in a disorganised tide"". While the Countess plays Mozart on her harpsichord, and the Count tends to his library, this crowd draws ever closer, threatening destruction on their arrival. Each flower delays the inevitable, pushing the crowd back slightly. But there are only so many flowers, and no more are growing. The villa's days are numbered, husband and wife living in an exquisite glass prison. To briefly spoil the ending, when the mob finally reaches the edge of the gardens, they find only crumbling relics: the lawns overrun with weeds, the house full of rotting doors and caved-in floors. On the terrace there stand two statues protected by belladonna-laced thorn bushes. The stone woman clutches a rose; an Ovidian vision of protected permanence sprung forth from the land, saved from the ravages of time. Commentators writing breezy accounts of this year's costume theme have focused on the metaphorical significance of Ballard's story, pointing to its exploration of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction (the fact that one of the top-ranked explainers on Google from 2016 uses that exact wording is, I'm sure, complete coincidence.) Although this holds some truth, it does seem to deliberately ignore a more obvious point. This is a short story in which the last bastion of rich, refined beauty – with its classical music, rare books, and its lovely clothing – is overrun by a working-class mob. ""Some laboured under heavy loads suspended from crude yokes around their necks; others struggled with cumbersome wooden carts, their hands wrenching at the wheel spokes,"" Ballard writes.  The mob is variously described as a tide, a nightmare, and a minor detail from a Goya painting. More like this: It's a jarring image in the context of an event that is a celebration of affluence, excess and rarefied beauty, where a table for the evening sells for $300,000, and an invite bestows an exclusive glitter of Vogue-approved importance on the attendee; perhaps acutely so, when set against the backdrop of global volatility and economic uncertainty, the divisions between safety and danger, wealth and poverty feeling ever starker. Under those circumstances, what on Earth are we to make of this theme based on a story that, regardless of where its loyalties lie, features the destruction of high culture by an undifferentiated mass of humanity? In its evocation of beauty on the brink of ruin, who does it disdain? Any discussion of wealth and exclusivity in the context of the Met Gala is a little plus ça change . Events like this have always been for the privileged few. Similarly, given the consistency of world inequality, contrasting celebrities parading in expensive gowns with images of abject poverty is nothing new (and it is worth pointing out that these expensive gowns do generate a lot of jobs). That said, it is rare to have a dress code that manages to touch on that inequality quite so explicitly before immediately burying it again beneath predictions of attendees wearing ""melancholic florals"". Those contrasting images often rub shoulders in an age where they might pop up one after the other on an Instagram story: the same tools that have made the Met Gala so phenomenally popular also enhance our proximity to suffering the world over. In 2023, the Met Gala generated 12.3 billion impressions for Vogue's channels under the hashtag #metgala, while the event's livestream generated 53 million views across Vogue's various social platforms and global markets. We live in an age of visual saturation, where tragedy and beautiful distractions crowd in on all sides, clamouring for our attention. The Gala itself has been around since 1948, when fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert (a busy woman who was also responsible for the inception of New York Fashion Week) put on a midnight fundraising dinner costing $50 a head. In the 1970s, shrewd Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland introduced costume themes, cementing the event as a crucial part of the socialite calendar, and ensuring a steady stream of funding for the Costume Institute. However, although it's gone from strength to strength under Anna Wintour's gaze, it's really only been in the past decade or so that the Met Gala has played a pivotal role in popularising the idea of fashion as mass entertainment – aided, of course, by enormous advances in social media. It has become the red carpet to end all red carpets, a chance for the whole world not invited to the costume party to enjoy judging its attendees on how gorgeous, inventive and fitting (in all senses of the word) their outfits are. And just with other forms of mass entertainment, it is both extremely enjoyableand extraordinarily lucrative. According to LaunchMetrics , last year the Gala accrued nearly $1 billion in media-impact value for the various brands involved – and a nice packet of publicity for everyone in attendance. It would be interesting to know how the Ballard short story first came to the table. Was it just a neat title? Or is someone in the committee's midst trying to foment class rebellion? Perhaps the dystopian premise is part of a fiendish plan to get people talking – after all, no publicity is bad publicity for the Met Gala. It welcomes controversy, whether it's Kim Kardashian wearing Marilyn Monroe’s famous ""Happy Birthday, Mr President"" dress or Doja Cat attending dressed as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat Choupette, speaking only in meows. This may be too generous a reading though, given that the fashion world loves a reference shorn of complexity. There are some interesting parallels with the 1927 silent film Metropolis, another fashion favourite that has inspired designers including Thierry Mugler , which features a paradisical garden quite literally built above the working masses. At the very least, we can hope that Iris van Herpen brings a thoughtful interpretation. Whatever the reasoning, there's a certain, delicious irony found in invoking Ballard at the Met Gala. The Garden of Time belongs to the earlier, most science fiction-oriented part of his career, which sprawled in all sorts of directions over the decades but retained a consistently bleak interest in the apocalyptic atmosphere of modernity and its uncertain future: frequently invoking urban hellscapes, wide-scale global destruction, mass media, the cult of celebrity, the thin line between spectacle and violence, and identities configured through consumerism.  In an essay written for Vogue in the 1970s, he even predicted the rise of social media: ""Every one of our actions during the day, across the entire spectrum of domestic life, will be instantly recorded on video-tape. In the evening we will sit back to scan the rushes, selected by a computer trained to pick out only our best profiles, our wittiest dialogue, our most affecting expressions filmed through the kindest filters, and then stitch these together into a heightened re-enactment of the day."" One wonders what he would have made of his own work being amplified and distorted in such a context, his words becoming the backdrop to a fluttering cornucopia of florals, each outfit paraded on the first Monday in May a blooming display of finery hiding a complex network of roots – sponsorship deals, brand calculations, dedicated craftsmanship, exposure opportunities – beneath its pretty skirts. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The much-delayed measure had vocal opponents in Congress and it took a fragile bipartisan deal to get the $61bn (£49bn) package through. Republicans said more than a third would be dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the US support as ""vital"". The aid is likely to include air defence systems, mid to long-range missiles and artillery shells. It is unclear when it will arrive. The package will now go to the Senate, which is expected to pass it within the next few days before President Joe Biden signs it into law. Ukraine, which relies on Western weapons, desperately needs the aid as it struggles to contain invading Russian troops, who have been making steady advances in recent weeks. Mr Zelensky said the aid should come as quickly as possible. In an evening address on Sunday, he said that if Ukraine were given the right weapons it could change the situation on the frontline. ""Frontline air defence is as crucial as the protection of our cities and villages. Our long-range capabilities. Our artillery. Our ability to expand the area of our control,"" he said. ""Every day is important now."" Alongside replenishing weapons and ammunition systems, Ukraine will also receive more than $9bn (£7.28bn) of economic assistance in the form of ""forgivable loans"" - ones that do not need to be paid back. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since then tens of thousands of people, mainly soldiers, have been killed or injured on both sides, and millions of Ukrainians have had to flee their homes. Ukrainian soldiers are now running low on munitions and having to ration artillery shells on a front line more than 1,200km (745 miles) long. Last weekend, the head of Ukraine's military warned the battlefield situation in the east of the country had ""significantly worsened"" as Russia intensified its armoured assaults. Cheers and applause erupted in the House when the measure passed, by 311 votes to 112, with some Representatives waving Ukrainian flags. Welcoming the result, Mr Biden praised the bipartisan effort to ""answer history's call"" and urging the Senate to approve it quickly ""so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs"". The foreign aid package passed on Saturday also includes: Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the significant boost in aid would supplement the tens of billions of assistance being provided to Ukraine by European allies. ""Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia,"" EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel said in a joint statement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the package would ""make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians"". Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukraine's foreign affairs committee, described the vote as a ""historic decision"" that would ""definitely save lots of lives of our civilians and our soldiers"". ""It gives us strength, it gives us courage and resolve to continue to fight, and I'm sure that the situation at the front will soon change in our favour,"" he said. Both Mr Zelensky and head of the CIA William Burns have said that Ukraine will lose the war without American help. That has been reinforced over the past six months by Russia taking more territory, and other Western allies struggling to fill the gap left by Washington. Ukraine is now feeling the weight of American support once more. This is not the silver bullet which will help Ukraine win the war, but it extends its window to fight and keep the negotiating table at bay. The House vote had been delayed by Republicans for months, with some objecting to sending money overseas instead of dealing with the US-Mexico border issue. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he wanted to push the measures through, even if it jeopardised his position. On Saturday, it was passed by a comfortable margin - but those numbers obscure the increasingly sharp partisan divides on the issue. While all 210 Democrats voted in favour, more Republicans were against the legislation than in favour of it, 112 to 101. That could spell trouble for Mr Johnson. Three House Republicans are already calling for him to be ousted as Speaker. They may even force a vote on the matter next week. While the billions of dollars in new aid is expected to sustain the Ukrainian war effort in the months ahead, if Republicans gain more power in Congress - or take back the White House - further US support seems increasingly unlikely. Separately, the House also passed a bill that would force the China-based owner of the TikTok social media platform to either sell its stake or face a ban in the US."

The UK will provide an additional £500m to Kyiv on top of the £2.5bn allocated for this financial year. Rishi Sunak wants to emphasise the UK's role in defending Ukraine. Mr Sunak will then head to Berlin to meet the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday. Europe confronts an ""expansionist Russia"" and Ukraine faces a ""difficult summer"", Downing Street says. ""Defending Ukraine against Russia's brutal ambitions is vital for our security and for all of Europe. ""If Putin is allowed to succeed in this war of aggression, he will not stop at the Polish border,"" Mr Sunak said. Ukraine and Poland share a 300-mile border. Poland also has a 130-mile land frontier with Russia itself - with Kaliningrad, the chunk of Russia, its exclave on the Baltic Sea. The focus from Mr Sunak is the extra support for Ukraine and so he will argue for Europe as a whole: more ammunition, air defences, drones and engineering support. In what it is billing as it largest-ever single delivery of equipment, the UK is sending more than 1,600 strike and air defence missiles, and additional Storm Shadow long-range missiles. There will also be more than 400 vehicles, including 162 armoured vehicles, 60 boats, including offshore raiding craft, and nearly four million rounds of ammunition. The additional £500m in funding for this year would also be put towards drones made in the UK, Downing Street said. As well as meeting Mr Tusk, who used to be one of the European Union's most senior figures, and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the UK will offer to deploy an RAF squadron to carry out policing of Poland's skies for Nato next year. It is another reminder that alongside war in the Middle East, war continues in Europe too. And conversation about it will continue on Wednesday in Berlin, when Mr Sunak meets the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The US House of Representatives has finally approved billions of dollars in new US military aid for Ukraine. The much-delayed measure had vocal opponents in Congress and it took a bipartisan deal to get the $61bn (£49bn) package through. It will now go to the Senate, which is expected to pass it within the next few days before President Joe Biden signs it into law. And following a Nato-Ukraine summit last week, Mr Stoltenberg said Nato will give Ukraine more advanced air defences after urgent Kyiv pleas and deadly Russian attacks."

It is the second report of the brakes failing on this particular model while in motion. Mr Phillips said it was ""terrifying"" to feel ""out of control"" of the vehicle while his family were also inside. Jaguar said it was investigating and took both claims seriously. Earlier this week , another I-Pace driver claimed to have found himself unable to brake on a motorway as the car accelerated and had to be flanked by police. ""Following the incident involving a Jaguar I-Pace on the M62 on the afternoon of 6th March, we are looking into this matter with urgency,"" Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said. ""A full review is underway to determine the cause of this incident, which is still yet to be established. The safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority."" It said it was also taking Mr Phillips' claims seriously. Mr Phillips' experience, first reported by the Daily Mail, happened on New Year's Eve 2023. He told BBC News: ""In the afternoon, I'd set off from home with my wife and kids in the back of the car. I'd barely gone a mile from home and as I came to traffic lights, travelling at about 30mph, three cars away from the lights I could not brake. ""I was pushing on the pedal, but the hydraulic felt like it was pushing my foot up. My whole body was locked up trying to push down on the brake."" He said fortunately the lights then changed from red as he could not have physically stopped. ""I immediately returned home really slowly. I didn't want to go above 10 to 15mph. I would not want anyone else to be in the same situation, particularly with children in the back."" He had owned the car for more than three years and has now returned it. He called for a full recall of the model by Jaguar as a safety precaution. A Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said: ""We are taking these recent claims by Mr Phillips very seriously and are looking into his complaint. In addition we are concerned to hear that Mr Phillips may not have received the high levels of care to which we hold ourselves accountable. ""Our client experience as well as the safety of our clients and vehicles is JLR's highest priority."" Like many electric vehicles, the Jaguar I-Pace offers regenerative braking, in which the energy created as the car brakes is re-captured and sent back to the battery. Thousands of the cars have been sold in the UK since 2018, which cost nearly £70,000. In 2019, some Jaguar I-Pace vehicles were recalled in North America because of a fault with the system. Jaguar was already due to end production of the I-Pace, which was its first electric car, next year."

""It's been a whirlwind,"" Daniel Rooney told BBC News. ""My phone's not stopped for three days. It's been really fun."" The 26-year-old had been playing at a hotel bar nearby when he was asked to step in for support act Murs, who could not make it due to transport issues. Take That's frontman Gary Barlow later thanked him on Instagram. Rooney, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, said he had been playing in his regular slot at the Radisson Red hotel when the presenter Ross King spotted him. He was then whisked to the Ovo Hydro, where he found himself playing in front of 14,000 fans. ""I usually play to around 40 people,"" he laughed. ""It's madness."" Rooney said he did not have time to feel nervous as it all happened so fast. ""I was more just focusing on what songs to sing,"" he said. ""I was more excited than anything else."" Rooney said Take That were ""brilliant"" and gave him some advice on what to play. When the gig finished, he also got some positive feedback from them. Barlow also showed his appreciation on social media, writing: ""This young man saved the day, thank you."" He added a picture of Rooney and three love heart emojis. Rooney said his friends and family didn't believe him when he first told them what had happened. ""They thought it was a wind-up,"" he said. ""It was only when they started seeing the news reports that they knew I wasn't joking."" He said he wants to enjoy his newfound fame and will spend the coming weeks recording some music. ""I just want to keep it going, and and see where it all goes,"" he said. Ross King told BBC Good Morning Scotland that he had been having a meal in the hotel when he saw the news that Murs could not make the gig. ""Gary Barlow is one of my best mates. We suddenly got in contact,"" he said. King said he told Barlow there was a ""young guy"" playing in the hotel, adding: ""He's a great player, he's a great singer and he's got a great personality, I'd love to bring him over."" He said Barlow responded, telling him to bring Rooney over. ""We literally ran from the Radisson Red, there were no soundchecks and Daniel went on and just absolutely slayed the audience. He was just sensational,"" he said. On social media, fans praised Rooney's performance at the Ovo Hydro, with one saying he'd smashed it. Murs, who has been supporting the world famous boy band on their This Life tour, was unable to make the gig on Friday night after his flight from London was cancelled. He had been updating fans over the day on his Instagram story on his efforts to get to Glasgow. He posted a video from inside the plane before exiting and attempting to board another flight. Eventually, he posted on social media that it was not going to happen. After their gigs in Glasgow, Take That are due to perform in Manchester this week. But their five dates will now be held at the AO Arena, after they were forced to move from the troubled Co-op Live arena due to ""ongoing technical issues""."

Mr Musk is suing the company he helped found, alleging it has abandoned its original mission of helping humanity. He says it is focusing on generating profits for partner and major investor Microsoft instead. But OpenAI says Mr Musk previously backed the idea of a for-profit structure and even suggested a merger with his car firm Tesla. In a blog post on its website, OpenAI also claims Mr Musk at one point wanted ""absolute control"" of the company, before eventually leaving it in 2018. It says it intends to move to dismiss claims in Mr Musk's recently filed lawsuit . OpenAI also published a trove of Mr Musk's emails to his fellow co-founders to dispute some of his claims. BBC News has approached Mr Musk for comment. But he has already responded to the blog post on X, formerly Twitter. ""Change your name,"" he wrote . Mr Musk's lawsuit, filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday 29 February, claimed that OpenAI breached principles he agreed to when helping co-found the company in 2015. It also took aim at Microsoft. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the AI firm since it established a for-profit arm in 2019, which allowed it to raise money. His lawyers argued in court filings the firm had since become a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world"". ""We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired - someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him,"" OpenAI said in its blog. It was written by fellow co-founders and executives including chief executive Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Mr Musk's lawsuit had targeted both Mr Altman and Mr Brockman, alongside the firm itself. The blog goes into detail to dispute a number of claims made in the lawsuit. It says that in early 2018 Mr Musk had forwarded an email saying OpenAI should join up with his electric car company, Tesla, to use it as its ""cash cow"". ""As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control,"" the blog post adds."
tech,tech,Neutral,"['AI', 'Picador', 'Canongate', 'Pegasus Books', 'USA & Canada', 'Facebook']",Why we have co-evolved with technology,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240404-why-we-have-co-evolved-with-technology-tom-chatfield-wise-animals,2024-04-06,0.22342691767024492,Normal,False,Unsustainable mining,"Our relationship with technology has a far deeper history than it seems, argues the philosopher and author Tom Chatfield in his book Wise Animals. The computer scientist Alan Kay once observed: ""Technology is anything that was invented after you were born, everything else is just stuff."" There's some truth to this: when asked to name a world-changing technology, many people might reach for something recent like AI, smartphones or the internet. What comes less readily to mind are the older ones, such as stone tools. However, if we want to understand today's technology better, we need to consider our long-running relationship with it, says philosopher and author Tom Chatfield. In his new book, Wise Animals: How Technology Made Us Who We Are , Chatfield argues we have co-evolved with technology over the last few million years. The entire human story, he says, is entwined with the innovations we create. Chatfield (who also contributes to BBC.com ) spoke to science writer David Robson about our ancestor's relationship with tech, how it has become an extension of our minds, and the insights that we can draw from taking a longer perspective on today’s developments. What inspired you to write Wise Animals? As someone who loves technology, I've been very frustrated by the way that it’s so often talked about – as though people are just consumers who are interested in buying technologies with a bunch of features that are going to fix their problems. Technology is implicated in everything we do; it's bound up with our politics, our personal relationships, the education of our children and the future of our planet. So it feels very important to me that we have a rich, multi-faceted way of talking and thinking about technology that gets the full spectrum of human activities into these discussions. As part of your research, you looked deep into prehistory and human evolution. What should we know about our ancestors' relationship with technology? The crucial point for me is that we can't put our finger on a single moment in which technology emerged, but we can say that technological culture predates the evolution of anything like Homo sapiens . When our ancient ancestors started crafting fine stone tools, and then later started creating survival strategies through fire and the harnessing of artificial heat, they moved to a place where technological expertise and bodies of knowledge were non-optional; when survival strategy was predicated upon intergenerational knowledge – an adaptation through nurture, rather than through nature. You suggest that technology is now so entwined with who we are that it's become an extension of our minds. What ethical issues does this bring? I borrow this concept from the philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers. They made the point that, in many ways, human minds are literally extended into aspects of the environment surrounding them. So when I write things down, or even when I use my fingers to count, I'm outsourcing an aspect of cognition. The same occurs when I use a computer to manipulate shapes on a screen to see whether they will or won't fit together or fit into a certain space. I am almost becoming a coupled system with that device in order to perform a cognitive act. Their paper predated the rise of the smartphone, and the thesis was so radical at the time that they had trouble finding a publisher, but it has now come to seem almost like common sense. If your phone batteries run out, you feel like a little bit of your mind is missing. A large part of your mental or cognitive capacities are bound up with the human-made world, and the ethics of these things and the values embedded in them are very important. For example, I could theoretically outsource a lot of child-raising to automated systems. I could set up surveillance cameras with climate control and AI. My children could be monitored in their rooms with facial recognition, and when they're sad, it could produce voices that cheer them up or it could them the story when they’re ready for bed. Fairly obviously, that is a horrific scenario, because, by outsourcing these things, I completely withdraw from a mutually caring, loving relationship with my children. The model for me is that we need a knowing and informed negotiation with the technologies around us – a conversation about what we want from the human-made world, why we want it, and which of its offerings might not be aligned with human thriving. These are incredibly important conversations. We mustn't be afraid to use the language of values and sentiment and morality when it comes to technology. As a prosaic personal example, I'm happy to offload navigational skills to my phone, but I hate it when my phone starts auto-suggesting answers to people's messages. I don't really want to offload my social cognition to a computer – I'd rather engage in real communication from my mind to another person's . Precisely. The question is, what tasks are so dangerous, dull, demeaning or repetitive that we're delighted to outsource them, and what do we feel are important to be done ourselves or by other humans? If I was going to be judged in a trial, I don't necessarily want an algorithm to pass a verdict on me, even if the algorithm is demonstrably very fair, because there's something about the human solidarity of people in society standing in judgement of other people. At work, I might prefer to have a relationship with human colleagues – to talk to and explain myself to other people – rather than just getting the work done more efficiently. Technology may have evolved with us, but it’s not alive. Yet many of the latest technologies, especially artificial intelligences, can appear to act like they have a mind, tricking us into recognising some kind of sentience. You describe this as the ""anthropomorphic delusion"". What is it? And why is it dangerous? There's a double danger to anthropomorphism. The first is that we treat machines like people, and project personalities, intentions and thoughts onto artificial intelligences. Although these systems are extraordinarily sophisticated, they don't possess anything like the human sense. And it's very dangerous to act as though they do. For a start, they don't have a consistent worldview; they are miraculously brilliant forms of autocomplete, working on pattern recognition, working on prediction. This is very powerful, but they tend to hallucinate and make up details that don't exist, and they will often contain various forms of bias or exclusion based upon a particular training set. But an AI can respond fast and plausibly to anything, and as human beings, we are very predisposed to equate speed and plausibility with truth. And that's a very dangerous thing. You may also like: Similarly, we might overlook the very large corporations that lie behind these entities, who have their own agendas, their own modes of profit, their own issues around privacy, and so on. So anthropomorphism gets in the way of something really important, which is the well-informed, critically engaged process of debating what these systems are, what they can do for us, what their risks are, and how we should deploy and regulate them The other danger of anthropomorphising technology is that it can lead us to think of and treat ourselves like we're machines. But we are nothing like large language models: we are emotional creatures with minds and bodies who are deeply influenced by our physical environment, by our bodily health and well-being. Perhaps most importantly, we shouldn’t see [a machine’s] efficiency as a model for human thriving. We don't want to optimise ourselves with perfectible components, within some vast consequentialist system. The idea that humans can have dignity and autonomy and potential is very ill-served by the desire to optimise, maximise and perfect ourselves.

The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of users' data and its links to the government in Beijing. Lawmakers from both major US political parties have called for a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell the app to a non-Chinese company. They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government. The House of Representatives and Senate have now both approved a $95bn (£76bn) foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan which also contained a bill paving the way for the forced sale of TikTok. The legislation has been signed into law by President Joe Biden . Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed. Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020. But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook. Although Mr Biden has signed the bill into law, it does not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok. The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect. That means that the sale deadline would most likely come some time in 2025, after the winner of the 2024 presidential election takes office. If Mr Trump wins, he may seek to block the ban from being implemented. TikTok has vowed to fight the forced sale in the courts, which could take years. The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices. App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. TikTok has called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech. ""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told users in a video , ""we aren't going anywhere"". He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk. ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move. Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban. Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work. In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill. But the deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired . Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation. It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears . At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You. The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app. This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral. Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system. This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing. But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users."
business,business,Neutral,"['Japan Airlines', 'Japan Airlines', 'JAL', 'Japan Air System', 'JAS', 'JAL', 'JAL', 'JAL', 'Japan Airlines', 'Airbus', 'Japan Airlines', 'JAL', 'JAL', 'JAL', 'JAL', 'JAL']",The ex-flight attendant who became the first female boss of Japan Airlines,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68823400,2024-04-26,0.11406239117376615,Normal,False,Air pollution,"When Mitsuko Tottori was named as the new boss of Japan Airlines (JAL) in January, it sent a shockwave across the country's corporate sector. Not only was Ms Tottori the carrier's first female boss, she had also started her career as a member of cabin crew. The headlines ranged from ""first woman"" and ""first former flight attendant"" to ""unusual"" and ""no way!"" One website even described her as ""an alien molecule"" or ""a mutant"", a reference to her having worked at Japan Air System (JAS), a much smaller airline that JAL bought two decades ago. ""I didn't know about an alien mutant,"" Ms Tottori  laughs as she spoke to me from Tokyo. In short, she was not from the elite group of businessmen that the carrier had customarily appointed to its top job. Out of the last 10 men who held the post, seven were educated at the country's top university. Ms Tottori is a graduate of a far less prestigious women-only junior college. With Ms Tottori's appointment, JAL has joined the less than 1% of Japan's top companies led by women. ""I don't think of myself as the first woman or the first former flight attendant. I want to act as an individual so I didn't expect to get this much attention."" ""But I realise the public or our employees don't necessarily see me like that,"" she adds. Her appointment also came just two weeks after JAL's flight attendants were lauded for the successful evacuation of passengers from a plane that collided with a coast guard aircraft during landing. Japan Airlines Flight 516 burst into flames after the collision on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Five of the six crew on the coastguard plane died and captain was injured. However, within minutes of the collision, all 379 people on board the Airbus A350-900 had safely escaped. The rigorous training of the carrier's flight attendants was suddenly in the spotlight. As a former flight attendant herself, Ms Tottori learned the importance of aviation safety first hand. Four months after she became a flight attendant in 1985, Japan Airlines was involved in the deadliest single aircraft accident in aviation history, which killed 520 people on Mount Osutaka. ""Every member of staff at JAL is given an opportunity to climb Mount Osutaka and speak to those who remember the accident,"" Ms Tottori says. ""We also exhibit aircraft debris at our safety promotion centre so instead of just reading about it in a book, we look with our own eyes and feel with our own skin to learn about the accident."" While her appointment in the top job came as a surprise, JAL has changed rapidly since it went bankrupt in 2010, in what was the country's biggest ever corporate failure outside the financial sector. The airline managed to continue flying thanks to major state-backed financial support and the business underwent a sweeping restructuring with a new board and management. Its saviour was then-77-year-old retiree and ordained Buddhist monk, Kazuo Inamori. Without his transformational influence it is unlikely that someone like Ms Tottori could have become JAL's leader. I spoke to him in an interview in 2012 . He did not mince his words, saying JAL was an arrogant firm that did not care about its customers. Under Mr Inamori's leadership the company promoted people from frontline operations, like pilots and engineers, rather than from bureaucratic posts. ""I felt very uncomfortable because the company didn't feel like a private firm at all,"" Mr Inamori, who died in 2022, told me. ""Many former government officials used to get golden parachutes into the firm."" JAL has come a long way since then, and the attention its first female president is receiving is not surprising. The Japanese government has been trying for almost a decade to increase the number of female bosses in the country. It now wants a third of leadership positions at major businesses to go to women by 2030, after failing to achieve the goal by 2020 . ""It is not just about the corporate leaders' mindset, but it is also important for women to have the confidence to become a manager,"" says Ms Tottori. ""I hope my appointment would encourage other women to try things that they were afraid of trying before."""

Almost 1,000 artists were played often enough to generate at least £100,000 in royalties each, the company added. The figures were revealed as part of Spotify's ""Loud and Clear"" campaign, which aims to provide transparency on how it pays the music industry. However, the company is unable to say how much of those royalty payments actually goes to musicians. That's because every artist has a different contract with their record label and publishers, which determines how the money is divided. The artist's share is often around 16%, a committee of MPs heard in 2021 . That would mean an artist whose music generated £100,000 on Spotify might only receive £16,000 in royalty payments, before tax. However, Spotify is not the only source of revenue. The Swedish company has about a 50% share of the UK music streaming market, according to the CMA , which means artists could make the same amount again via platforms like Apple Music, Amazon Music and Tidal. Ed Sheeran was the most popular British artist on Spotify last year, with his songs played 6.35 billion times. Coldplay came second with 5.58 billion streams, followed by Harry Styles with 5.11 billion streams. However, British artists were unable to crack Spotify's Top 10 most-played chart, which was topped by Taylor Swift (on 29 billion streams) and also featured Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny, Mexico's Peso Pluma and Colombia's Karol G.  The shift suggests that speaking English is no longer a pre-requisite for global music success. More than half the artists who generated $10,000 (£8,000) on Spotify last year are from countries where English is not the first language, the company said. English is still the top language for music globally, accounting for 54.9% of the top 10,000 songs. But its share of the market is falling, with languages like Hindi and Japanese making gains. ""It's really interesting time for music,"" said Spotify UK's head of artists and industry partnerships, Bryan Johnson. ""In the past few years, we've seen genres like K-pop and Amapiano take off, and now Music Mexicana is really starting to travel. ""The choice now for fans and listeners is incredible."" He noted that 75% of all the royalties paid to UK artists came from international listeners - suggesting there is still a ""huge export opportunity"" as the streaming market matures. Johnson added that independent artists and labels received 40% of the UK's royalty payments - a total of £300 million. They typically receive a higher share of the proceeds, with artists who self-release music (ie without the help of a record label or distributor) sometimes keeping 100% of the income their songs generate.  However, Spotify has come under fire recently for demonetising songs with fewer than1,000 streams. That means the copyright holders will not be paid at all, if the song falls below that threshold in a 12-month period. Critics have complained that the policy means will ""enrich the top of the pyramid"" and starve working musicians of money. But Johnson said the policy was designed to filter out ""spam"", and thwart fraudulent activity. Spotify has previously noted that 1,000 plays only generates a ""micro-payment"" of around $0.25 (£0.20) that artists rarely see - because distributors often set a minimum threshold before artists can withdraw money. In 2024, the company expects that the new policy will divert $40 million (£32 million) to more popular songs. ""This is not something that Spotify takes,"" said Johnson. ""The money goes back into the pool... to emerging and professional artists."" This year marks the first time that Spotify has disclosed its figures for UK payouts. It says the total of £750 million has doubled since 2017. Earlier this year, the company announced it had paid $9 billion (£7.2 billion) in royalties worldwide last year, making it the biggest single contributor to the music industry's revenues. YouTube, once the thorn in the industry's side, is thought to be the industry's second largest source of income. In February, it said it had paid out $6 billion (£4.8 billion) to rights-holders last year."

The Book House in Thame, Oxfordshire, has appealed for pictures taken of the puffin over the years. They hope the beloved bird, known as Fat Puffin, could get a makeover on BBC programme The Repair Shop . Luise Pattinson said previously unseen photos could show how ""fundamental"" it had been to the town. Mrs Pattinson, who runs the shop with brother-in-law Brian Pattinson, said: ""He is so special, he's quite embedded in the history of Puffin Books and the history of the town, so he's a very special gentleman indeed."" Fat Puffin, who measures more than 1m high (3.2ft), was gifted to the shop by Puffin Books in 1972, as it was one of the few children's bookstores in the country. But his condition has deteriorated over the years through wear and tear, being knocked over and a kidnapping by students in 1984, which left him dangling from the town hall by a rope. ""They presented us with a demand for £3m which we promptly paid and he was returned,"" Mr Pattinson joked. He no longer has his wooden plinth, part of his foot has broken off and his head is prone to toppling, despite attempts to mend him with car repair kits. ""He's had too many bumps,"" Mrs Pattinson explained. ""His head cracked open once and he had a big split which we tried to repair ourselves. ""When we shook out all the ballast we found a load of money so people obviously thought he was an RSPB collecting box when he had the split in his head. ""So he's all chipped and all his joints are now creaking and splitting, so he needs a really good makeover because he's just breaking apart bless him."" Fat Puffin used to be sighted outside the shop with a fellow puffin called Muffin, who he ""married"" in 2004. Mrs Pattinson said: ""They're celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary this year. ""Poor old Muffin is not quite as heavy and portly, so she abandoned her place by the front door quite a while ago because she had a tendency to fly off down the High Street with every puff of wind, and wasn't quite so stable.

politics,politics,Neutral,"['The Ministry of Defence', 'MoD', 'MoD', 'MoD']",DragonFire: UK laser could be used against Russian drones on Ukraine front line,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68795603,2024-04-12,0.14104324846995586,Normal,False,Unsustainable mining,"A UK high-power laser weapon could be sent to Ukraine to take down Russian drones, the defence secretary says. According to Grant Shapps, the weapon could have ""huge ramifications"" for the conflict in Europe. The DragonFire weapon is expected to be rolled out by 2027, but Mr Shapps said he wanted to ""speed up"" production and make it available sooner. It follows a successful trial of the laser, carried out against an aerial target for the first time in January. The laser was originally expected to be operational by 2032, but new reforms intended to speed up government procurement of weapons mean that it will now be ready five years earlier. Despite this, the defence secretary told reporters while on a visit to Porton Down military research centre near Salisbury that he wanted to speed this up even further. ""Let's say that it didn't have to be 100% perfect in order for Ukrainians perhaps to get their hands on it,"" he said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says the faster timetable comes in response to the ""rapidly changing threat environment"" faced by the UK. ""It's designed to not wait until we have this at 99.9% perfection before it goes into the field, but get it to sort of 70% and then get it out there and then develop it from there,"" Mr Shapps said. ""But 2027 is still the date as of this moment,"" he continued. The weapon is precise enough to hit a £1 coin from a kilometre away, according to the MoD. It is hoped that it will pave the way for a low-cost alternative to missiles, to shoot down targets such as drones. January's successful test of the weapon was carried out at the MoD's Hebrides Range in Scotland and was hailed as a ""major step"" in bringing laser-directed energy weapons (LDEWs) into service. The greatest advantage of lasers is cost and, in theory, an ""unlimited magazine"" of ammunition - as long as there is a reliable source of power. But the big drawback is that they can only fire at targets in the line of sight, unlike most missiles. The US has been testing directed-energy weapons for decades. They have been fitted on to several warships for trials and evaluation. The UK's ambition to do the same by 2027 might be possible, but lasers have not been tried and tested in battle. US warships are still shooting down Houthi drones in the Red Sea with conventional missiles. Any suggestion that UK lasers could be sent to Ukraine to take out Russian drones is optimistic. Ukraine's demands are more urgent. It requires mobile air defence systems which have been proven in battle. With its electrical grid constantly being targeted by Russia, lasers which require a source of power, are unlikely to be the solution to Ukraine's urgent needs. LDEWs use an intense light beam to cut through their target and can strike at the speed of light. As a line-of-sight weapon, it can attack any visible target that is close enough, although the range of the DragonFire system is classified. Missiles can be far more expensive than the drones they destroy, with some costing millions of pounds compared with a few thousand. The MoD says firing the DragonFire system for 10 seconds is the cost equivalent of using a regular heater for an hour, with the operating expense typically less than £10 a shot."

The tech giant was forced to act by EU politicians concerned about it having a market monopoly. The decision is being watched closely around the world and was initially celebrated as an industry victory for businesses and consumers in the EU. But Apple's strict new rules and fees are being heavily criticised, with Spotify calling them ""extortion"". It is one of many companies, including Fortnite maker Epic Games, that has been pushing Apple to allow alternative app stores on iPhones. The EU lawmakers hoped their rule change would encourage smaller challengers to enter the lucrative iPhone market. ""Apple says it's opening up, but it still has a tight fist around iPhones"", says Colton Adamski, a former hacker and businessman who lives near Chicago and is trying to launch one of the first alternative app shops in the EU. The 22-year-old has been running an unofficial iPhone app store for more than six years. It is, in his words, a ""grey business"" operating on the fringes of what is legal. For everywhere other than the EU, starting an app store is against Apple's terms, and installing apps outside the official App Store is prohibited. The process, known as side-loading, is common practice on Android phones, but Apple has forbidden it since launching the iPhone, arguing it is a security risk. Apps need to be verified through the official App Store, the tech giant has long said. Apple charges an average 30% commission to apps using its store, which it says is for the protection of consumers. Although the fee is controversial, it is true that generally Apple is more successful at keeping malicious apps out than other marketplaces like Google's Play Store. Colton's app shop has attracted hundreds of thousands of downloads of unofficial apps and games. The BBC tried his service and was able to download apps to an iPhone through a simple workaround that changes the phone settings to override security warnings. He has made a decent living operating his under-the-radar app shop, but has long wished to make one legitimately. So when the EU's new laws were announced in January, he jumped at the chance. ""It was so exciting we finally had the opportunity to go from a 'grey' store operating in the margins of what's allowed to finally launching a legit store,"" he says. Apple is now the biggest smartphone seller globally and has the most affluent user base, so getting his store on to iPhones would be a major win. Colton's excitement diminished though when he and his team started reading Apple's terms and conditions. He compares Apple's rules to a gangster from The Godfather or Sopranos. Yes, you can open your shop on their turf, but you have to do exactly as they say or they will shut you down. Apple insists that new app shops have €1m (£851,000) in the bank, but if their reserves dip below that figure, they can be closed down. Apple did not respond to our questions about why this is needed, but has previously said it is about weeding out dodgy, or scam, stores. In the last few weeks, since Colton secured his line of credit, Apple has said that app developers of ""good standing"" for at least two years can also build an app shop without the €1m. Colton's next hurdle to overcome is how to make a profit. Apple automatically bills new app stores half a euro for every download after one million. Apple says this Core Technology Fee is about keeping iPhones safe through security updates. But Colton feels this is like a so-called protection fee paid to a mob under the guise of making sure a shop owner's business is safe. So if someone downloads his app shop app but never uses it, he still has to pay Apple 50 cents. Apple is also applying the 50 cent fee to individual apps that receive more than a million downloads, which is worrying some popular app makers. The company has created a website where app developers can estimate how much money they would owe Apple if they choose to list their apps on other stores. It could total thousands if the million download figure is passed, but if they sold exclusively through Apple's App Store it would cost nothing. Another charge being criticised is the 17% fee Apple will charge on any sales of an app sold on its App Store and elsewhere. Apple argues that 99% of apps it currently hosts are small enough that they can reduce or maintain their current fees. ""Ultimately, we want developers to have the flexibility to choose the business terms that make the most sense for them,"" a spokeswoman said. But, according to Colton, just like The Godfather, Apple is making companies an offer they cannot refuse to keep them listing only on the App Store. ""Many app developers I know are angry and upset. How on earth can they explain this Core Technology Fee? We don't see Android pulling that nonsense,"" Colton says. Android phones, running Google software, have historically been more open, allowing other app shops to exist like Samsung Galaxy Store and Huawei AppGallery. But Google's own app shop - Google Play - is by far the most dominant player and, like Apple's App Store, charges apps on average 30% of their profits or subscriptions as commission. EU lawmakers who created the Digital Markets Act have not yet given an opinion on Apple's alternative app store rules, and say they will assess them once they are seen in practice. For now, Colton says he is determined to make his app store work. ""It's proving to be really tough but me and my team are working hard because this is literally the future of iPhones,"" he said."

Julius Kivimäki obtained them after breaking into the databases of Finland's largest psychotherapy company, Vastaamo. After his attempt to extort the company failed, he emailed patients directly, threatening to reveal what they had told their therapists. At least one suicide has been linked to the case, which has shocked the country. Kivimäki has been sentenced to six years and three months in prison. In terms of the number of victims, his trial was the biggest criminal case in Finnish history. One of them gave their reaction to the BBC. ""The main thing is that this absolutely empathy-lacking, ruthless criminal gets a prison sentence"", said Tiina Parikka. ""After this there rise thoughts about how short the conviction is, when reflected against the number of victims"", she added. ""But, that's the Finnish law and I must accept that."" The 26-year-old had maintained his innocence - despite going on the run and being arrested in Paris under a fake identity. During the trial, he also went missing for more than a week after refusing to be recalled back to prison by the court. The judges found him guilty of all counts, describing his blackmail as ""ruthlessly taking advantage of another person's special weakness."" ""Taking into account Vastaamo's position as a company producing mental health services, Kivimäki has caused great suffering or the risk of it to the interested parties,"" the verdict document said. The verdict brings to an end a cyber crime spree that started when he was just 13 years old. Kivimäki, known online as Zeekill, was a key member of multiple teenage cyber gangs which caused chaos between 2009-2015. He was arrested in 2013, at the age of 15, and given a juvenile non-custodial two-year suspended sentence. At the time, cyber experts were worried his punishment would fail to deter him - and he was quickly linked to many more hacks carried out with teen gangs before disappearing for years. His name was quickly linked to the Vastaamo hack of 2020 after experts pointed to  Kivimäki traits in the attack. He demanded a 400,000 Euro (£340,000) ransom from the company. When it refused, he emailed thousands of patients asking for 200 Euros and threatening to publish their notes and personal details on the darknet which he did anyway in full. But it was a mistake that the hacker made himself that led police to a treasure trove of information found on a server that Kivimäki owned. Unprecedented digital forensics and cryptocurrency tracking also helped secure the conviction.  Tiina Parikka recalls receiving the email from him saying that he had her therapy notes. She told the BBC it caused her to relapse into mental health problems that the therapy had initially helped her overcome. “So many people were affected by this in so many ways,"" she said. The boss of Vastaamo, Ville Tapio, was also convicted of failing to protect his customers' sensitive data. Investigations found that the databases were vulnerable and open to the internet without proper protections. He was given a suspended three-month prison sentence last year. The company which was once a highly regarded and successful business in Finland collapsed after the hack. Despite the conviction, the Vastaamo case is not over as civil court cases are now likely to begin in an attempt to get some of the victims compensation for the hack."

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would look into whether staff had falsified records. It said Boeing was re-inspecting all 787 jets on the manufacturing line. Boeing will be forced to develop an ""action plan"" to address concerns about planes already in service, it added. Boeing did not comment. Internally, the company told staff last week that the ""misconduct"" had not created an ""immediate safety of flight issue"", according to a message seen by BBC News. ""We quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,"" Scott Stocker, head of the Boeing 787 program, said in the email to staff. The FAA said that Boeing had come forward ""voluntarily"" last month to warn that it ""may not have completed"" inspections required to confirm adequate electrical safeguards where the wings join the main body of certain of its 787 Dreamliners, a large jet often used on international flights. ""The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records,"" it said. ""As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action - as always - to ensure the safety of the flying public."" It is the latest problem to erupt at Boeing in recent years. In January, an unused emergency exit door blew off a new 737 Max 9 plane shortly after take-off, thrusting its manufacturing and safety processes into the spotlight. The incident prompted the temporary grounding of dozens of planes and has forced the firm to drastically slow production, while sparking increased regulatory oversight, criminal investigation and other legal and financial troubles. In March, chief executive Dave Calhoun said he would be stepping down by the end of the year, becoming the most high-profile person to exit the company in the wake of the incident. Boeing's reputation had been damaged a few years ago, when two of its 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, claiming the lives of 346 passengers and crew. A 737 Max flown by Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off in March, 2019, following a Lion Air crash in October 2018. That led to the then chief executive Dennis Muilenburg being fired. Last month, Congress hosted a hearing featuring whistleblowers, including Sam Salehpour who testified that his concerns about the 787 had been dismissed.

Long before the polio vaccine , there was the iron lung . A large, cumbersome device that, by some accounts, looked like a ""coffin with legs,"" the iron lung was groundbreaking in its day. The device enabled hundreds of individuals to survive polio, a viral infection that attacks the body and can lead to paralysis and death within a matter of hours as breathing muscles become immobilised. However, with the iron lung, a massive machine that encases patients and provides air pressure to help the impacted individual's paralysed lungs function, life could continue for years. Such was the case for Paul Alexander, known globally as ""The Man in the Iron Lung"" , who died this week at the age of 78. Alexander contracted polio in 1952, when he was just six years old, leaving him paralysed from the neck down. Although he made tremendous progress learning to breathe on his own for short periods of time – he attended school and practised as a lawyer – Alexander lived the remainder of his life relying on the iron lung to survive. Developed in 1927 by a faculty member from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, industrial hygienist Philip Drinker, the iron lung was first used to save the life of a child in 1928 . It swiftly became a fixture in polio wards during the polio outbreaks of the subsequent decades, particularly from 1948 until the vaccine was developed in 1955. And its creation paved the way for many subsequent medical innovations. During the early 20th century, polio outbreaks were occurring around the world, spread via contaminated food and water. And up until the 1955 vaccine, the iron lung was the primary mode of treatment for severe cases and was considered state-of-the-art technology. A giant, airtight metal cylinder that weighs as much as 650lb (295kg) that's connected to a bellows, the iron lung requires polio patients to slide inside up to their neck. The bellows, which is attached to a pump, continuously cycles air in and out of the box, helping the patients continue breathing by sucking the chest open, forcing air to rush in to fill the lungs. This form of artificial respiration is known as External Negative Pressure Ventilation (ENPV). ""The invention of the iron lung irrevocably changed the relationship between humans and machines,"" says Hannah Wunsch, a critical care physician with Weill Cornell Medical Center Anesthesiology and author of The Autumn Ghost, a book that traces how intensive care units and mechanical ventilation are the foundation of modern medical care. ""For the first time, an individual struggling to breathe for an extended period of time could receive support, with the machine doing some or all of the work of breathing."" Some patients spent just a short time in the iron lung, perhaps weeks or months until they were able to regain chest strength and breath independently again. But for patients whose chest muscles were permanently paralysed, the iron lung remained the key to survival. While it was a lifesaving development, there were also many limitations with the iron lung for both patients and medical providers. Many patients felt trapped inside of the device, and it was difficult for doctors to access a patient's body and provide treatment to someone encased in the iron lung. But the invention, nevertheless, laid the foundation for many future medical advances. ""That concept of supporting an organ, such as the lungs, became the centrepiece of modern critical care,"" says Wunsch. The development of the iron lung is often seen as a milestone in the development of mechanical ventilators, which were not widely used prior to the polio outbreak. ""Ventilation science came into brighter lighting as a result of the iron lung,"" says Peter Gay , a pulmonary, critical care and sleep physician with the Mayo Clinic. ""The physiology of gas exchange was better understood once they mechanised moving air in and out of the body."" One of the early ventilator developments was pioneered by Bjorn Aage Ibsen. In 1953, Ibsen proposed using ""positive pressure"" ventilation. In contrast to the iron lung, which relied on negative pressure ventilation that suctioned air into a patient's lungs, positive pressure ventilation would push air into the lungs by hand, without the aid of machine. Subsequent ventilator developments, which blow air into the lungs, were more portable than the iron lung – and far less cumbersome and invasive. This type of positive pressure approach would later be used routinely in the operating room by anesthesiologists. While ventilator technology has evolved dramatically over the years and expanded, it remains very similar in concept to what was developed early on. Modern ventilators that sit at a patient's bedside delivering positive pressure in an intensive care unit can be traced back to the polio epidemic. The development of iron lung technology ""created the concept that you could put a whole lot of people into a room and support them with this life-saving gas exchange that they needed,"" adds Gay. Thus, the idea of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was born. According to the Respiratory Care Journal , ""The first ICUs were set up to manage in some cases dozens of patients, of all ages, requiring negative-pressure ventilation because of poliomyelitis [polio]."" ""You had these units with all of these polio patients using the iron lung, and that's where the idea of intensive care units really took off,"" continues Gay. ""That's why anesthesiologists initially became the critical care experts. Because anesthesiologists were largely the first to administer this type of intensive care."" More like this: • The drug pilots take to stay awake • Women's fertility is more complicated than you might have heard • What can you absorb through your skin? Wunsch concurs, pointing out that ""creating respiratory centres for the care of polio patients supported by iron lungs helped cement the idea that complex care of patients required a dedicated area, with highly skilled caregivers. This concept is also very much at the heart of modern ICUs."" Equally important, the ability to support a patient’s respiratory system more effectively has allowed for better treatment of many other critical illnesses. ""So often, when people have critical illness, respiratory failure accompanies the illness – when patients are septic, or have pneumonia or infections – the respiratory system has to be supported in order for any other organ failure to be recovered,"" adds Gay. Polio was feared around the world at the peak of its epidemic. The disease left hundreds of thousands of children paralysed each year. The iron lung helped save many of them: In the United States alone, it was used by 1,200 people in 1959. Fast-forward to late 2019 and early 2020, and the world one again found itself grappling with a frightening disease. During the Covid-19 pandemic peak, ventilation was once again at the forefront of treatment. Most recently, a team of engineers and doctors has invented the modern version of the iron lung – technology that serves as a breathing aid for patients with Covid-19. The new device, which is still in development and has not yet been brought to market, is named Exovent NPV. It is also a negative pressure ventilator, and works by decreasing ""the pressure outside the body to allow lung tissue to expand and function in a way that resembles normal breathing,"" according to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. There is also hope that the device may be used to help with conditions such as pneumonia. The Exovent is merely the latest example of a medical innovation that can trace its roots back to the invention of the iron lung. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday."

Ten contestants are whisked away to a remote Italian villa, and surprise, surprise, as the name suggests - are introduced with a kiss. I Kissed a Girl follows last summer's hit show I Kissed a Boy, and started this week on BBC3, with Priya Sohanpal, 23, from Newport, one of the contestants. So what is it like to be on the show? Priya initially hid her application from friends and family, and when she was approached was in two minds about appearing, thinking ""what business do I have being on a reality TV show?"" She said in many South Asian communities it is taboo to talk about being in a relationship let alone being gay, and she was worried about her family's reaction - but they were very supportive. Priya decided to go through with it, adding: ""I wasn't expecting much. ""The next thing you know, I'm packing my bags and going to Italy. ""I wanted to do it because I was like, why not? It'll be life-changing, and what an opportunity to represent South Asian queers."" Describing her worries over what her friends and family would think, she said: ""I remember I had a Zoom call with someone from production, I told my family it was  a job interview. ""I told them towards the end of the process and they were fine about it. ""Ever since the show came out they've been super supportive, all my friends are kind of gagged by everything. They saw the first two episodes and said they could never do it. ""They said they didn't know how I had the confidence to kiss someone in front of a million cameras."" Her decision to appear has been vindicated with lots of positive feedback so far. ""Plus, I've had messages from South Asian queer women saying thank you for representing South Asians, because in our community, it's taboo to talk about being in a relationship, let alone being gay,"" she added. ""I'm proud to have this chance to be able to represent queer South Asian girls in Wales."" Priya came out to her parents in 2020. She said: ""I only recently came out to my family. I was definitely nervous about telling my dad because he's an old Punjabi man. ""I didn't know how to tell him, but it ended up being really easy because I had my ex-girlfriend over. ""I was like, 'oh dad, by the way, this girl who's been coming round, she's not my friend. She's my girlfriend'. ""He just said 'okay' and walked off. I didn't make a big deal about it."" When Priya told her extended family, she described them being shocked at first, but her mum was also very supportive. ""She was really happy for me,"" Priya added. ""I'm so lucky to have such a supportive family, because I know not every South Asian queer woman has that experience and may not have a safe space. ""I think it's really important for people in my community to talk about it more so it becomes less of a taboo."" She described it being difficult to date growing up in Newport, adding: ""I have never dated anyone from Newport, because I have just never found anyone. ""I'm very proud to be from Newport, I just haven't found people from here that I relate to, especially being a minority. ""I was like one of very few South Asian people in my school. So I grew up in a very white environment. ""When I went to university in Birmingham, I found more people that were my type. ""But then when I came out as gay, it was so hard. I think the closest thing I could get near me were gay clubs in Cardiff. ""Everywhere else, I just couldn't find anyone. So I went on (dating app) Hinge, I'd swipe all the time and then even put my location in America, because why not? Go to a different country. Try somewhere else."" Speaking about growing up, Priya said: ""I got bullied in school because of my race. ""Wales hasn't always been the kindest to me, but it's fine. ""I'm still proud to be a Welsh South Asian girl."" The series, which is a female version of last year's popular dating show I Kissed a Boy, features ten lesbian and bisexual contestants, alongside host Dannii Minogue and TikTok star Charley Marlowe, who is stepping into the voiceover booth to narrate the show. You can catch up on all episodes so far on BBC iPlayer ."
tech,tech,Neutral,"['the New York Stock Exchange', 'Reddit', 'IPO', 'Google', 'Advance Magazine Publishers', 'Tencent', 'Fidelity', 'ChatGPT', 'Facebook', 'TikTok', 'Gamestop', 'IPO']",Reddit aims for $6.4bn valuation ahead of initial public offering,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68535381,2024-03-11,0.16340075352886774,Normal,False,Unsustainable mining,"Reddit, one of the most popular websites in the world, is hoping for a valuation of up to $6.4bn (£5bn) when its shares go public next week. The social media company, which has never made a profit, will float shares on the New York Stock Exchange. A filing in the US revealed that Reddit and its investors are hoping to sell 22 million shares for between $31 and $34 each. However, many users worry the move will fundamentally change the website. Some shares will be specially reserved for some Reddit users and moderators. The company is planning an initial public offering (IPO) which would make some of its shares publicly available to buy for the first time. ""Our users have a deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit,"" wrote co-founder Steve Huffman in a letter to prospective investors released a few weeks ago. ""We want this sense of ownership to be reflected in real ownership - for our users to be our owners. Becoming a public company makes this possible."" Reddit, which was founded almost 20 years ago, is an online forum where users can post questions and comment on topics that interest them. The company makes most of its money through advertising on the platform, although it recently struck a deal with Google which allows the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. Reddit has recorded losses every year since its start, including more than $90m last year. The valuation is also far less than the $10bn at which it was valued in a private fundraising round in 2021. Currently, the biggest shareholders include media company Advance Magazine Publishers, Chinese tech firm Tencent, US investment firm Fidelity, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT makers OpenAI. Reddit, founded in 2005, has a different feel compared with other social media companies such as Facebook or TikTok. Users often feel freer to write what they like, although subreddits are policed by moderators. The power of Reddit communities has been seen through examples such as the Gamestop saga in 2021, where users mobilised to drive up the share price of the US video game retailer. Shares which were initially worth $20 shot up to a peak of $350 after co-ordination from Redditors. However, some users are worried that the IPO would change the site for the worse. ""When the most important customers shift from [users] to shareholders, the product always [suffers],"" said one person. ""It becomes 'what can we do this quarter to squeak out an additional point of revenue', instead of 'how can we make this product better'."""
politics,politics,Neutral,"['the US Senate', 'Patriots', 'Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems', 'HIMARS', 'HIMARS', 'Bradley', 'the US Army Tactical Missile Systems', 'ATACMS']",What $61bn US aid boost could mean for Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68872783,2024-04-24,0.1103085168321829,Normal,False,Soil contamination,"A $61bn package of military aid for Ukraine has been passed by the US Senate and is headed to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. So what weapons might Ukraine receive and what difference could they make in trying to stem Russian advances? The most pressing weaponry needed by Ukraine falls into three categories: air defence systems, mid to long-range missiles and artillery shells. Here is where the US aid could go in these areas. Repelling the Russian threat from the skies is vital for the protection of cities and critical infrastructure such as energy plants. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had been attacked by almost 1,200 Russian missiles, more than 1,500 drones and 8,500 guided bombs this year alone. Ukraine has a variety of western-supplied systems ranging from shoulder-launched Stinger short range missiles all the way up to the advanced - and extremely expensive - Patriot system. Zelensky said at least seven more Patriots, or their equivalent, were needed. Russia's cruise and ballistic missiles - including converted S-300 and S-400 surface to air missiles - along with hundreds of Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones - are difficult to counter because of the sheer volumes launched. A classic tactic to overwhelm air defences is to swamp them with targets, thereby occupying their acquisition and tracking radar systems and depleting missile stocks. But the war on the ground is vital. Since October, Ukraine has lost nearly 583 square kilometres (225 square miles) of its eastern territory to Russian forces, largely because of a lack of artillery. High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) have played a crucial role for Ukraine, by delivering guided munitions from a mobile platform. Arrive at location, set-up, fire and quickly move on before Russian forces can locate and attack the launcher. Expect more HIMARS capability in Ukraine, and perhaps a commitment for more tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Significantly, the long-range version of the US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) has recently arrived in Ukraine. Older ATACMS systems have been in the country since late last year, but the newer version can double ranges to 300km (186 miles). It takes the fight deeper into annexed Crimea, which Russia uses as a major naval base protected by air assets, and beyond. And let's not forget bread-and-butter weapons. M777 howitzers need to be fed a continuous diet of 155mm artillery shells. The United States has sent 2,000,000 such shells to Ukraine since February 2022 and more will likely be sent in this latest package. The United States has what it calls a ""very robust logistics network"" to get arms there quickly - within days, it says. Supplies are likely to have been moved closer to Ukraine, and once they are handed over they officially become the property of Ukraine. But getting the gear to the frontline - the artillery equipment particularly - could take many days or even weeks, as Russian forces continue their pounding in the east. Last week, Russia said it would increase the intensity of strikes on logistics centres and storage depots holding Western weapons. These pre-date this tranche of cash but are notable now because they are close to coming into service. Ukrainian pilots and crews continue their conversion training to western F-16 jets, currently in Romania. These multi-role aircraft provide a stronger air-to-air and air-to-ground capability, thereby potentially improving Ukrainian air defences. Denmark, the Netherlands and the US expect to deliver the first of dozens of ""Vipers"" to Ukraine within months. The jets won't be a game-changer but another significant arrow in the quiver for Kyiv. Moscow has been dismissive, saying the F-16s wouldn't make much of a difference on the battlefield and would be shot down by Russian forces."

The two men, described as dual German-Russian nationals, were detained in Bayreuth on suspicion of spying for Russia, prosecutors say. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said authorities had prevented ""possible explosive attacks"". The men are accused of scouting US military facilities and other sites. The main suspect, Dieter S, has been remanded in pre-trial detention accused of a string of offences, including plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence. He is also alleged to have fought for a Russian proxy armed force in occupied eastern Ukraine from 2014-16. The second suspect, identified as Alexander J, is accused of helping him since last month to identify potential targets for attack. He was due to appear in court on Thursday. The Russian ambassador has been summoned by the foreign ministry in Berlin. Ms Faeser condemned ""a particularly serious case of alleged spy activity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's criminal regime"". Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to prosecutors, Dieter S is alleged to have discussed potential sabotage operations in Germany with his Russian contact since October last year, in an attempt to undermine its support for Ukraine. They cite preparing explosive and arson attacks, especially on military and industrial infrastructure. Dieter S is said to have scouted potential targets including US military facilities, taking photos and videos and handing the information to the Russian contact. According to the Spiegel website, a US Army facility at Grafenwöhr in Bavaria was spied on. Last year, the US sent dozens of Abrams battle tanks to Bavaria for Ukrainian soldiers to train on at Grafenwöhr and another base at Hohenfels before the tanks were sent to the front line in Ukraine. The case is reminiscent of series of arrests in Poland a year ago, when authorities said they had dismantled a Russian spy network which was preparing sabotage attacks aimed at paralysing supplies of military aid to Ukraine. German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann told German news agency DPA that the two arrests were ""another significant investigative success"" in the fight against Russian sabotage and spy networks. Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck, currently on an unannounced visit to Kyiv, said on Thursday that he was there ""at a time when Ukraine needed all the support it can get in its fight for freedom"". The government in Berlin is spearheading a plan to help bolster Ukraine's air defences. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday that EU countries should try to help Ukraine with additional air defence systems, especially Patriot systems. Germany has already sent Ukraine two Patriot air defences and has promised a third. The two arrests in Bavaria follow several other high-profile espionage cases in Germany. Last summer a German national working for the military procurement agency was arrested in the western city of Koblenz on suspicion of handing information to Russian diplomats in Bonn and Berlin. In a separate scandal, the former boss of a collapsed German payment processing company, Wirecard, is believed to have fled to Moscow after the firm collapsed. Jan Marsalek is now suspected of being a Russian spy, who recruited officials in Austria to pass on sensitive information ."

Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed for at least seven more Patriots or similar defence batteries to protect its cities and power plants from Russian attack. But Greece has said it cannot spare any of its Patriot or S-300 systems. Reports say Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system. Spain and Greece have come under pressure to help Ukraine from both Nato and European Union allies, in response to attacks on vulnerable cities including Chernihiv and power facilities in Kharkiv and close to Kyiv. Ukraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300. Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. President Zelensky said on Friday that Russian jets had targeted Ukraine with more than 9,000 ""guided aerial bombs"" so far this year and Kyiv needed to be able to shoot their planes down. ""We urgently need better systems. And missiles for them to save lives right now,"" he told a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, an alliance of Nato members and partner countries. Germany has already promised an extra Patriot, and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $6bn weapons programme on Friday, to include missile intercepts for Patriot and Nasam (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) air defence systems. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg has suggested that Ukraine's allies have not provided support they promised. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell said this week: ""The Patriots are in the capitals. And it's up to them to take the decisions."" Greece in particular has stocks of Patriots and S-300s. But Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis has ruled out handing any to Kyiv. ""We explained why we cannot do it,"" he told Skai TV. His said his country's air defences were ""critical systems for the protection of Greek air space"". Athens has provided Kyiv with weapons and ammunition but is wary of losing any of its deterrent capability because of potential flare-ups with neighbour Turkey, even though relations at the moment are relatively stable. Spain's military has three Patriot batteries, but argues that it needs them and can only provide a ""very limited number"" of Patriot missiles because its reserve is low, sources have told El País newspaper. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. The continuing dilemma for Ukraine's military commanders is where to place the missile systems, close to the country's vulnerable cities or near the front line where Russia's advances are most intense. Recent Russian successes have been characterised by greater use of airpower. Su-34 fighter bombers have been dropping precision-guided munitions on Ukrainian forces. We do not know where Ukraine place their SAM systems, but mitigating this growing Russian aerial threat might mean missile defence concentrates on the eastern front line. That risks taking away a degree of missile defence for key cities and important areas of infrastructure - the sort of areas that have been regularly pounded by Russian cruise missiles and attack drones. That is why Ukraine has been pleading for greater missile defences to plug the gaps in vulnerable areas. Russia's latest strikes have targeted Ukraine's railway system in three regions. Rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia said three of its mechanics were killed in a Russian missile attack while they were working in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday. Russia said it hit a train carrying Western weapons and military hardware near Udachne, about 45km (28 miles) from the front line. Thirteen people were also wounded in a strike on a train station in Balakliya, in the Kharkiv region, and officials said a passenger train was 15m (50ft) from the station when it came under attack. In a separate Russian attack, rail infrastructure was damaged in the central Cherkasy region. Meanwhile, Ukraine has had to pull back US M1 Abrams battle tanks from the front line, according to a report by the Associated Press. Thirty-one Abrams tanks were originally provided to help Ukrainian forces operate on the battlefield, but Russia's increased use of drones has made the tanks harder to protect and five have been lost, AP reported."

Evolv Technology makes ""intelligent"" scanners designed to replace metal detectors by identifying people with concealed guns, knives and bombs. But the company has come under mounting criticism for overstating what the technology can deliver. Evolv told BBC News it had altered its claims about UK testing to ""better reflect the process taken"". The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into the company last month. And in October the company revealed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was looking into its marketing practices. As well as in many large stadiums and hundreds of schools in the US, Evolv scanners are used in the Manchester Arena. The company had said that its AI weapons scanner had been tested by the UK Government's National Protective Security Authority (NPSA) On 20 February the company put out a press release, including a claim that the NPSA was one of a number of testers who had ""concluded that the Evolv Express solution was highly effective at detecting firearms and many other types of weapons"". But BBC News can reveal the NPSA does not do this type of testing. When BBC News put this to Evolv, the company said: ""After discussion with NPSA, we updated the language used in the February 20 press release to better reflect the process taken."" Instead, it said: an independent company had ""tested and validated"" Evolv's technology, using NPSA standards. But the UK company that did this testing, Metrix NDT, told BBC News it was ""not correct to say we 'validated' the system"". Metrix NDT managing director Nick Fox told BBC News that Evolv's system had indeed been tested against NPSA specifications. But when asked if Metrix NDT had found it ""highly effective at detecting firearms and many other types of weapons"", he said: ""It is not within our remit to pass any value judgements on the results."" Evolv told the BBC that in addition to those results, Evolv makes available to any serious prospective customer full third-party testing reports for detection performance. Prof Marion Oswald, who was on the government's Centre of Data Ethics and Innovation advisory board until last year, told BBC News it was worrying the technology was replacing ""tried and tested"" security options. ""It does highlight the need for really close scrutiny and potential additional regulation of companies making these types of claims,"" she told BBC News. And she worried how customers might be influenced, ""especially if claims are being made about how certain government bodies may have been involved"". Evolv has previously said its technology detects the ""signatures"" of concealed weapons. ""Metallic composition, shape, fragmentation - we have tens of thousands of these signatures, for all the weapons that are out there,"" chief executive Peter George said, in 2021, ""all the guns, all the bombs and all the large tactical knives."" But the company has faced criticism it cannot reliably detect knives or bombs. Evolv now says it can detect ""many types of knives and some explosives"". In 2022, following a Freedom of Information request by the security-analysis company Internet Protocol Video Market (IPVM), BBC News revealed that testing by a US facility had found Evolv's technology could not consistently detect knives and certain types of bombs. Evolv should inform potential clients, the testers said. But during that investigation, in August 2022, Evolv had also told BBC News the NPSA (then called the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure CPNI) had tested its system. ""We have tested with the UK CPNI,"" a representative told BBC News. A Home Office official said: ""We are looking to further understand the capabilities of weapons-detection equipment."" Evolv also amended another claim in its 20 February press release.  Evolv had initially referred to the designation of its technology under the US Department of Homeland Security Safety (DHS) Act as an example of recent ""third party testing"". This was later changed so as to reflect the fact that this designation does not involve the conduct of a new test by the DHS but is an evaluation of other evidence. In May last year, BBC News revealed further details of a stabbing in a New York school that used Evolv scanners. Proctor High School's then superintendent, Brian Nolan, said: ""Through investigation, it was determined the Evolv Weapon Detection System… was not designed to detect knives."" The victim is suing Evolv and the scanners were replaced by 10 metal detectors. The company has changed the front of its website many times. Initially claiming its goal was to create ""weapons-free zones"", the website now says its mission is to create ""safer experiences"". Last year, the company said it regretted any confusion around the capabilities of its technology.

The heavily indebted water firm aims to spend at least £1.1bn more on environmental measures. Regulator Ofwat had dismissed the company's original proposal, leading to questions over the firm's future. Thames's huge debts have led to speculation it could be taken over by the government. Thames is the UK's largest water company, with 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region. However, it currently has debts of about £15.4bn and it has also come under fierce criticism for water leaks and sewage spillages. Thames had originally proposed investing £18.7bn between 2025 and 2030 and increasing customer bills by 40%, on top of inflation, over the five-year period. Ofwat dismissed this plan, prompting shareholders at Thames' parent company, Kemble Water, to withdraw a proposed cash injection and default on debt interest payments . Thames has now proposed spending an extra £1.1bn on top of its original plans on ""projects benefiting the environment"", although it did not give details of what these would be. The new total investment of £19.8bn would still require customer bills to rise by 40%, reaching an annual average bill of £608.30 by 2029-30. But Thames also said it could potentially increase investment by another £1.9bn, although that would lead to average bills rising by 44% to £627. Thames is by no means the only water company planning big prices rises over the next few years. In plans put before Ofwat in October last year, Southern Water proposed a 66% price rise on top of inflation, while Severn Trent put forward a 37% increase. Mike Keil, interim chief executive at the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""On the surface, the proposal for more investment from Thames Water is a positive step for its customers that have endured some of the worst customer service in the sector."" However, he added that only 16% of its customers thought the proposed bill increases in the five-year plan were affordable. ""This announcement appears to offer nothing to ease the fears of those already struggling to pay,"" he said. It is thought that a final decision from Ofwat will come at a crucial meeting on 23 May with a ""draft determination"" of what companies will be allowed to charge from next year issued on 12 June. Thames Water's operating company has reassured its 16 million customers it has enough money in the bank to continue delivering water and waste services until May of next year. Thames Water chief executive, Chris Weston, said: ""Our business plan focuses on our customers' priorities... we've now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment. ""We will continue to discuss this with our regulators and stakeholders."" The company has been under fire for its environmental record, and in recent weeks pollution levels in the River Thames have come under renewed focus. In last month's Oxford and Cambridge boat race, both crews were given safety advice to avoid swallowing water splashed up from the river. Last week, television naturalist Steve Backshall described pollution found in the river as ""toxic"" after Bangor University analysis found high levels of norovirus and E. coli in water taken near the border between Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The samples were taken downstream from Little Marlow Sewage Treatment Works, although Thames Water said all discharges from the site had been fully compliant with environmental law. Earlier this year, data from Thames Water, analysed by London's City Hall , showed the number of hours in which sewage was dumped into the River Thames more than quadrupled last year. Analysts say Thames Water's current debt amounts to about 80% of the value of the business, making it the most heavily indebted of England and Wales' water companies. A large proportion of its debt was added when Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank, owned Thames, with its debts standing above £10bn when the company was sold in 2017. Macquarie said it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's infrastructure, but critics have argued it took billions out of the company in loans and dividends . Thames Water says it has not paid dividends to external shareholders since 2017. However, dividends can also be used to move money around businesses owned by one parent company. Thames Water has paid over £200m in dividends to other companies within the group in the past five years."

The Forget-Me-Notts project has been giving out mattresses, bed frames and bedding across in Nottinghamshire since 2017. But the charity behind it, Operation Orphan, said it was now struggling to meet demand, with 40 families on its waiting list. Staff said referrals from social services had been increasing over the last two years but donations from local businesses, organisations and families were dwindling. Children’s charity Barnardo’s said about one million children in the UK were currently experiencing ""bed poverty"". Brad Moore, co-founder and managing director of Operation Orphan, said: “We’ve delivered about 1,300 beds since 2017. “Referrals are going up and now, yearly on average, we’re installing up to 350 beds.” Mr Moore said bed poverty had short and long-term consequences on children, including their behaviour” and learning at school. Matt Simpson, who delivers and assemble beds, said: “It’s so sad to see in this day and age, children living in Dickensian conditions”. The charity said some of the children they deliver to “barely have anything” and are often “sleeping on the floor or sharing a bed”. “It’s heartbreaking at times when you walk into a home. It never gets easier - you just get a bit de-sensitised to it, but the reality is always there and it’s always shocking to be honest,” caseworker Daniel Griffith said. Domestic abuse survivor Kemi fled from a violent relationship with her three children. When she was provided a house, she said “there was nothing” in it, “not even carpet”. Forget-Me-Notts provided her family with beds and bedding. She said: “I’ll never forget the day they turned up. They set up the bed in my boys’ room and that was the start of our journey.” “The boys came home from school and they couldn’t believe it. The joy on their faces, that gave me hope.” Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram . Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk or via WhatsApp on 0808 100 2210."

The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) says Sellafield Ltd is alleged to have committed the offences between 2019 and early 2023. The facility, on the Cumbrian coast, is widely regarded as Western Europe's most hazardous nuclear site. The ONR says public safety was not put at risk. The regulator says the decision to prosecute Sellafield follows an investigation it carried out. It says no further details can be given because legal proceedings are now under way. The Guardian reported in December 2023 that Sellafield had been hacked by cyber groups ""closely linked to Russia and China"". In an interview with the BBC later that month, Sellafield's boss, Euan Hutton, insisted there had been no cyber attack on the site. In response to ONR's announcement, Sellafield has issued a statement confirming it had been notified it was to be prosecuted.

Maxim Kharkin is aged 35 and a Russian speaker, his mother told Russian media. She added that he had called her at 07:00 on the morning of the attack. Elkana Bohbot , 34, had gone to the party with friends and, before losing contact, he spoke to his wife and mother telling them he was helping to evacuate the wounded, the Times of Israel reported. Hours later, his family found a video of him posted online by Hamas, which has been seen by BBC Verify. Rom Braslavski , 19, was working on security for the festival. According to an account published by Hostages and Missing Families Forum, he was trying to rescue an injured person in the attack when he was caught in a volley of fire. He has not been heard from since. Omer Wenkert , 22 , a restaurant manager, sent a message to his family to say he was going to a safe shelter but then lost contact, his father Shai Wenkert told the BBC's Today Programme. Shai Wenkert said he had seen footage of his son in captivity, including a photo of him handcuffed and wearing only underwear. Evyatar David , 23, was at the festival and on the morning of the attacks, described fleeing from gunfire before losing contact with the outside world, his brother says. Later, his family say, Evyatar's sister posted on Instagram appealing for information about his whereabouts. She then received a text from an unknown number, which contained video footage of Evyatar handcuffed on the floor of a dark room. According to Israel's foreign ministry he is being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. Eitan Mor , 23, lives in Jerusalem, and was working as a security guard at the festival, the Times of Israel said. He reportedly texted his uncle after Hamas arrived and was last seen with a friend bringing others to safety. Alon Ohel , 22, a Serbian citizen, took refuge in a shelter after the festival came under attack, his family say. They have seen footage of him being dragged away after a grenade attack. Almog Meir Jan , 21, tried to flee the festival. He and a friend made it to the friend's car but only managed to drive a short distance before being forced to stop. Almog's family say they have seen a hostage video in which he appears. Inbar Heiman , a student aged 21, was seen by two young Israeli men being taken away from the festival on a motorcycle. Hamas have released a video in which she is seen very briefly. Hersh Goldberg-Polin , 23, a dual US-Israeli citizen, was badly injured in the attack, his family told the BBC. Eyewitness accounts say  he was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck - the last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza. Segev Kalfon , 26, was running away from the festival, across the highway, when he was captured by Hamas, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Orión Hernández Radoux , 30, from Mexico, attended the festival with his girlfriend, Shani Louk. He has not been seen since. The Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. Shani, a German citizen, was initially thought to be among those seized. But on 30 October, her mother Ricarda told German media that the family had been informed by Israeli military of her death following DNA identification. Romi Lesham Gonen , 23, was on the phone to her mother as she tried to escape from the Supernova festival. Merav Leshem Gonan has recounted a conversation in which her daughter begged for help after being shot. ABC News reports that Romi's phone is now in Gaza. Bar Kuperstein , 21, last spoke to his family early on the morning of 7 October, as the attack unfolded. Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information. Eliya Cohen , 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow. The family then found a photo of Eliya in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported. Amit Buskila , 28, from Ashdod, was last heard of making a call to her uncle, Shimon, as Hamas overran the festival. Her family say they have now been told by the government that she is being held in Gaza. Carmel Gat, 39, is Jordan's sister-in-law, and also was seen by her father being taken by gunmen from Kibbutz Be'eri, Haaretz newspaper reported. She has not been heard from since. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during the November ceasefire. Dror Or , 48, was seen by a neighbour being dragged out of his home in Be'eri, according to their nephew Emmanuel Besorai, along with his son and daughter. On Saturday 25 November Dror's son Noam , 17, and daughter Alma, 13, were released from captivity. The body of Yonat, 50 - Dror's wife and the children's mother - was identified among the 120 people murdered at the kibbutz, Yonat's brother told the Guardian newspaper. Tal Shoham , 38, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife Adi, also 38, her mother Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, were released by Hamas on 25 November, along with the couple's children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German/Israeli citizen - was killed on 7 October. Sagui Dekel-Chen , 35, an American-Israeli citizen, has been missing since Hamas's attack on Nir Oz, his father Jonathan told the BBC. He said his son was not found among the dead and the ""only reasonable explanation"" is that he was taken to Gaza. Thailand's ambassador to Israel says 26 of its citizens were taken hostage, 23 of whom have now been released. Those still being held are believed to include Watchara Sriuan, 32. His mother, Viewwaew, told the Thaiger news site that the family had been informed he was being held captive. Kiattisak ""Top"" Patee and a Mr Pongtorn (no first name given) have also been named by the Thai foreign ministry as hostages. A number of other people thought to have been held hostage are now confirmed to have died, either during the 7 October attack or while in captivity. On 7 May, Israel's Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said Lior Rudaeff, 61, was confirmed dead - having been murdered on 7 October and his body taken to Gaza. On 3 May, the IDF said the body of Elyakim Libman, 23, had been found in Israel. It had been thought he was kidnapped while working as a security guard at the Nova festival. In a Facebook post his father Eliyahu Libman had said a guard told him his son had helped rescue others before trying to escape. He was last seen trying to help two badly-injured women. On 16 December, the Israeli military expressed ""deep remorse"" after soldiers mistakenly killed three hostages in northern Gaza who had escaped from their captors. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26. The death of Tamir Adar, 38, was announced on 5 January by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. Other hostages recently confirmed to have died include Gadi Haggai, Ron Scherman, Nik Beizer, Tal Chaimi, an Israeli-Romanian citizen aged 41, Joshua Mollel, a 19-year-old Tanzanian student, 27-year-old Eden Zecharya, and 36-year-old Ziv Dado. Other fatalities include Sahar Baruch, 25, Dror Kaplun, 68, Aviv Atzili, 49, Arye Zalmanovich, 85, Ronen Engel, 54, Maya Goren, 56, Guy Iluz, 26, Ofir Tzarfati, 27, Ofra Keider, 70, and Eliyahu Margalit, 75. The bodies of 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano, and 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss were found by Israeli troops in buildings close to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. In March, the family of Uriel Baruch, 35, said they had been informed by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) that he was killed on 7 October in the attack on the Nova music festival, and that his body was being held in Gaza. He was married with two children. Hostages whose death has been reported, but not confirmed, include Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir.

It surpassed the previous record set in November 2021 - though by 2022 Bitcoin's value had sunk to $16,500. The new surge in price has been spurred by US finance giants pouring billions into buying bitcoins. The cryptocurrency rose to around $69,200 shortly after 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, before falling back. It was trading around $62,185 by 21:00 GMT. Bitcoin's value has spiked by more than 50% over the last month, according to cryptocurrency market data platform CoinMarketCap. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said its price could go higher than its new record but warned that crypto was ""notoriously volatile."" ""Too often in the past the price crash was timed so that ordinary investors buying Bitcoin during the bubble are the ones who lose out,"" she told the BBC. The new record represents another dramatic moment in Bitcoin's turbulent history. It was invented in 2009 by a person or persons calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto - their true identity remains a mystery. Conceived as a means to create money for the internet, its roots lay in an anti-establishment ethos encouraging people to live free from the existing power structure of financial institutions and governments. However, its new all-time high value has come about precisely because those establishment firms have been pouring billions of dollars into acquiring it. That has been made possible because, in January 2024, US regulators reluctantly approved several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). That allowed giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Between them, they have been buying hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, rapidly driving up their value. Prof Alexander told the BBC these entrants ""are attracting institutional investors into Bitcoin and they are putting a considerable upwards pressure on price."" But she added Bitcoin's ""halving"" event, expected to take place in April, may also influence the cryptocurrency's value. ""In the past, these events have been accompanied by price surges,"" she said. For many holders of Bitcoin, this will be a moment to celebrate - as their own wealth will have risen a great deal. But history suggests they should be prepared for that to change. Bitcoin's value tumbled to 18-month lows of nearly $20,000 in June 2022 as investors sought to cut ties with riskier investments amid a gloomy global economic outlook. The cryptocurrency's price slumped further later that year when FTX - the huge cryptocurrency exchange founded by so-called ""king of crypto"" Sam Bankman-Fried - collapsed into bankruptcy in November 2022. Its peaks and troughs continued throughout 2023, but it managed to climb back up to trade above $40,000 towards the end of the year. It is not just companies and individual investors who have been tracking those fluctuations closely. In Central America, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele has embraced the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin-loving leader has spent more than $100m of his developing nation's public money on buying almost 3000 bitcoins over the last few years. His investment is now worth around 60% more than he paid for it. Although no public records have been released on the specifics."

Fierce battles are ongoing in a several villages in the eastern Donbas region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was benefitting from warm weather - making terrain more accessible to its tanks - and making tactical gains. It comes as Germany said it will give Ukraine an extra Patriot missile defence system to fend off air attacks. In his update posted to social media on Saturday, Gen Syrskyi explained the situation on the eastern front had deteriorated as Russia intensified its armoured assaults. Battles have raged for control of Bohdanivka - a village west of the devastated city of Bakhmut, he said. The settlement lies a few kilometres northeast of the town of Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the town of Avdiivka in February to the south. Ukrainian officials say a slowdown in military assistance from the West - especially the US - has left it more exposed to aerial attacks and heavily outgunned on the battlefield. Despite repeated assurances that he is dedicated to Ukraine's defence, US House Speaker Mike Johnson has failed to advance a new military aid bill. The Democratic-controlled Senate passed fresh funding in February which included $60bn in aid for Kyiv, but conservative Republicans in the House objected to the bill as it did not include funds for border security. Gen Syrskyi said without fresh aid and sophisticated weapons Kyiv would be unable ""to seize the strategic initiative"" from the numerically superior Russian forces. Separately on Saturday, Germany vowed to give Ukraine an additional air defence system. Ukraine has made increasingly desperate appeals for supplies of air defence missiles in recent weeks. On Friday, a major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Trypillya power plant was the largest electricity provider for three regions, including Kyiv, officials said. In response, Berlin has agreed to give Kyiv an additional Patriot missile system. It is capable of intercepting Russia's most advanced munitions, including Kinzal hypersonic missiles. Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russian strikes against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure were causing untold suffering. President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Germany for the decision, calling it ""a true manifestation of support for Ukraine"". Since President Vladimir Putin won his stage managed election last month, Moscow has stepped up air attacks on Ukraine. Russia has, in recent days, unleashed three massive aerial strikes on its energy system, pounding power plants and substations. Elsewhere, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it has foiled an assassination attempt on the governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin. Officials said two men attempted to strike Mr Prokudin's car with a Russian-manufactured drone. ""This was not the first attempt, and probably not the last one,"" Mr Prokudin said a message posted to Telegram. SBU officials also said they had detained 11 networks of Russian operatives since the start of 2024. SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk said in another Telegram post that this was in addition to 47 last year."

So-called ""liberated zones"" were set up at Oxford's Museum of Natural History and King's College, Cambridge, earlier.

Oxford University has previously expressed ""profound sympathy for those suffering in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank"". In the past week, Pro-Palestinian protesters have have set up tents outside university buildings in cities including Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle as well as at Goldsmiths, University of London. In a joint statement, Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine called for the universities to stop lending ""financial and moral support"" to the Israeli government. ""Oxbridge's profits cannot continue to climb at the expense of Palestinian lives, and their reputations must no longer be built on the white-washing of Israeli crimes,"" it said.

Israel rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in its campaign in Gaza, and has insisted it has the right to defend itself following the armed incursion by Hamas on 7 October. On Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a ""hostile and toxic atmosphere"" on campuses and called on universities to ""take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously"".

business,politics,Neutral,"['the Army Tactical Missile Systems', 'ATACMS', 'ATACMS', 'NBC', 'ATACMS', 'US National Security', 'Congress', 'BBC']",Ukraine war: Kyiv uses longer-range US missiles for first time,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68893196,2024-04-25,0.06323521709079505,Normal,False,Methane release,"Ukraine has begun using longer-range ballistic missiles against Russia that were secretly provided by the US, American officials have confirmed. The weapons were sent as part of a previous US support package, and arrived this month. Officials said they were not announced publicly to maintain Ukraine's ""operational security"". They have already been used at least once to strike Russian targets in occupied Crimea. Further US aid is now heading to Kyiv. More American weaponry is expected to be sent imminently, after President Joe Biden signed off on Wednesday a new package of economic and military support for Ukraine worth $61bn (£49bn). The missiles that have already been quietly provided are the longer-range version of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), a state department spokesman confirmed on Wednesday. The US previously supplied Ukraine with a mid-range version of the ATACMS, but had resisted sending anything more powerful, partly over concerns about compromising US military readiness. Officials were also concerned that the Ukrainians could use the weaponry to strike inside Russian territory, causing the conflict to escalate, according to NBC, which first reported the news. The Ukrainians have long called for the systems, which can fire missiles up to 300km (186 miles). Mr Biden is said to have secretly given the green light in February. Briefing reporters on Wednesday, the state department spokesman confirmed that the provision of the longer-range ATACMS had been ""at the president's direct direction"". The US ""did not announce this at the onset in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request"", Vedant Patel explained. It is not clear how many of the weapons have already been sent, but US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington planned to send more. ""They will make a difference. But as I've said before at this podium... there is no silver bullet,"" he said. The longer-range ATACMS give Ukraine the ability to strike deeper into Russian-held areas; particularly bases, storage facilities and logistics hubs. They were used for the first time last week to strike a Russian airfield in occupied Crimea, US media reported, and then in an attack on Russian troops in the occupied port city of Berdyansk overnight on Tuesday. Russia said on Wednesday that the new weaponry ""will not fundamentally change the outcome"" of the war. Recent months have seen Kyiv step up its calls for Western assistance as its stocks of ammunition are depleted and Russia makes steady gains. The new aid package that was rubber-stamped by Mr Biden on Wednesday follows months of gridlock amid opposition to the aid from some in Congress. A billion-dollar weapons package is expected to be the first of many from the $61bn of fresh aid, not all of which will be spent on arms. US security assistance previously sent to Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion totals $44bn. ""It's going to make America safer, it's going to make the world safer,"" the US president said after signing the new aid into law. Reacting to the package, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""Now we will do everything to make up for half a year spent in debates and doubts. ""What the Russian occupier was able to do during this time, what Putin is now planning, we must turn against him."" Mr Zelensky recently warned that a Russian offensive was expected in the coming weeks after Ukraine's loss of the city of Avdiivka during the winter. Ukrainian forces have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defence systems in recent months and officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory. Mr Sullivan said on Wednesday it was ""certainly possible that Russia could make additional tactical gains in the coming weeks"". Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, tens of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured on both sides and millions of people have fled their homes.

The expanded State Secrets Law compels firms - including social media giants Tencent, ByteDance and Weibo - to take action if users post sensitive information. It requires ""network operators"" to monitor information being shared by users. The rules also describe how posts should be removed, records saved and reported to authorities. This is the law's first update in more than a decade and is in line with President Xi Jinping's focus on national security as the government cracks down on China's vast technology industry. When the new rules were first announced in February, a National Administration of State Secrets Protection official told the state news agency Xinhua that they were necessary as ""the guarding of state secrets faces new problems and challenges in the new era"". While internet companies in China are already subject to strict rules, the changes ""set a new standard for active self-monitoring and rapid cooperation"", said Hong Kong-based law professor, Ryan Mitchell. The revised rules also broaden the definition of what may be deemed as sensitive information to include ""work secrets"", or information about the decision-making of state agencies, which could be particularly problematic for journalists, including foreign correspondents. ""A main concern for us is the uncertainty as to what really constitutes a 'state secret',"" Jens Eskelund, President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China told the BBC. ""Clear demarcations and definitions would be helpful,"" he added. Taiwan has also voiced concerns about the new rules and said they could place visitors from the island to China at risk. Taipei’s Mainland Affairs Council said the legislation is “highly vague and may cause people to break the law at any time"". The international law firm Baker McKenzie FenXun said that while the definition of what are considered to be state secrets is ""broad and vague"" it should not have a substantial impact on multi-national companies operating in China. The new regulations come as the social media giant TikTok, and its Chinese parent company ByteDance, are facing increased scrutiny in the US and other Western countries. However, the new rules “do not seem to be mainly geared towards regulating the overseas operations of Chinese firms”, Mr Mitchell said."
business,business,Neutral,"[""Man Wah Furniture's"", 'Costco', 'Walmart', 'the Industrial Parks Association of Mexico', 'Tesla Gigafactory', 'Tesla', 'the Centre for China-Mexico Studies', 'the National Autonomous University', 'Man Wah Furniture', 'Walmart']",How Chinese firms are using Mexico as a backdoor to the US,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68825118,2024-04-22,0.19332902301645327,Normal,False,Toxic waste dumping,"The reclining armchairs and plush leather sofas coming off the production line at Man Wah Furniture's factory in Monterrey are 100% ""Made in Mexico"". They're destined for large retailers in the US, like Costco and Walmart. But the company is from China, its Mexican manufacturing plant built with Chinese capital. The triangular relationship between the US, China and Mexico is behind the buzzword in Mexican business: nearshoring. Man Wah is one of scores of Chinese companies to relocate to industrial parks in northern Mexico in recent years, to bring production closer to the US market. As well as saving on shipping, their final product is considered completely Mexican - meaning Chinese firms can avoid the US tariffs and sanctions imposed on Chinese goods amid the continuing trade war between the two countries. As the company's general manager, Yu Ken Wei, shows me around its vast site, he says the move to Mexico has made economic and logistical sense. ""We hope to triple or even quadruple production here,"" he says in perfect Spanish. ""The intention here in Mexico is to bring production up to the level of our operation in Vietnam."" The firm only arrived in the city of Monterrey in 2022, but already employs 450 people in Mexico. Yu Ken Wei says they hope to grow to more than 1,200 employees, operating several new lines at the plant in the coming years. ""People here in Mexico are very hardworking and fast learners,"" says Mr Yu. ""We've got good operators, and their productivity is high. So, on the labour side, I think Mexico is strategically very good too."" Certainly, nearshoring is considered to be providing an important shot in the arm to the Mexican economy - by June of last year, Mexico's total exports had risen 5.8% from a year earlier to $52.9bn (£42.4bn). The trend is showing few signs of slowing down. In just two months of this year, there were announcements of capital investment in Mexico of almost half of the annual total back in 2020. The Man Wah sofa factory is located inside Hofusan, a Chinese-Mexican industrial park. Demand for its plots is sky high: every available space has been sold. In fact, the Industrial Parks Association of Mexico say every site due to be built in the country by 2027 has already been bought up. Little wonder many Mexican economists say China's interest in the country is no passing fad. ""The structural reasons that are bringing capital to Mexico are here to stay,"" says Juan Carlos Baker Pineda, Mexico's former vice-minister for external trade. ""I have no indication that the trade war between China and the US is going to diminish any time soon."" Mr Baker Pineda was part of Mexico's negotiating team for the new North American free trade agreement, USMCA. ""While the Chinese origin of the capital coming into Mexico may be uncomfortable for the policies of some countries,"" he says, ""according to international trade legislation, those products are, to all intents and purposes, Mexican"". That has given Mexico an obvious strategic foothold between the two superpowers: Mexico recently replaced China as t he US's main trading partner, a significant and symbolic change. Mexico's increased trade with the US has also come about in part through a second key aspect of nearshoring in the country: US firms setting up Mexican facilities too, sometimes after relocating production from factories in Asia. Perhaps the standout announcement came from Elon Musk last year, when he unveiled plans for a new Tesla Gigafactory outside Monterrey. However, the electric car company is yet to break ground on the $10bn plant. And, while Tesla is apparently still committed to the project, it has slowed its plans amid concerns over the global economy, and recent job cuts at the carmaker. But regarding Chinese investment, some urge caution over Mexico being drawn into the wider geopolitical struggle between the US and China. ""The old rich guy in town, the US, is having problems with the new rich guy in town, China,"" says Enrique Dussel of the Centre for China-Mexico Studies at the National Autonomous University in Mexico. ""And Mexico - under previous administrations, and in this one - doesn't have a strategy vis-à-vis this new triangular relationship."" With elections looming on both sides of the US-Mexico border, there may be new political considerations ahead. But whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden in the White House over the next four years, few expect any improvement in US-China relations. Mr Dussel thinks nearshoring is better defined by what he calls ""security-shoring"", saying Washington has placed national security concerns above all other factors in its relationship with China. Mexico, he argues, must be wary of being caught in the middle. Amid this tension, Mr Dussel says: ""Mexico is putting up a big sign to China saying: 'Welcome to Mexico!'. You don't need a PhD to know that this isn't going to end well for bilateral relations between the US and Mexico in the medium term,"" he adds. Others are more optimistic. ""In my mind, the question is not if this trend will continue, but rather how much of this trend can we take advantage of,"" says former Mexican trade official, Juan Carlos Baker Pineda. ""I'm sure people are having these same discussions in Colombia, in Vietnam, in Costa Rica. So, we need to make sure in Mexico that those conditions that are aligned by themselves go hand-in-hand with corporate and government decisions to sustain that trend in the long term."" Back in Monterrey, the talented Mexican seamstresses at Man Wah Furniture put the finishing touches to another sofa before it's shipped north. When an American family buys it at a Walmart store near them, they may have little idea of the complex geopolitics underpinning its production.

Jens Stoltenberg was speaking at a ceremony marking the alliance's 75th anniversary. While the US provided Europe with security, he said it also needed the militaries, intelligence and diplomatic leverage of its European allies. ""I don't believe in America alone just as I don't believe in Europe alone,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""I believe in America and Europe together in Nato, because we are stronger and safer together."" The Nato chief's remarks came as the alliance considered a €100bn (£86bn) five-year fund to provide long-term military support for Ukraine, so aid to Kyiv is not jeopardised by political changes either in the US or other Nato states. A US package worth $60bn (£47bn) has been stalled in Congress for months because of resistance from Republican lawmakers, as well as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has spoken of ending the war ""in one day"". During his speech, Mr Stoltenberg said Nato must be ""doing something right"", as it had grown from 12 countries at its inception to 32. Its newest members Sweden and Finland abandoned their neutrality and joined the alliance as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to the speech that relations between Russia and Nato had ""slid to the level of direct confrontation"" as the alliance was already ""involved"" in the conflict around Ukraine. Although Nato is a defensive alliance Mr Peskov alleged it ""was conceived, configured, created and controlled by the US as a tool of confrontation"" and was now a ""destabilising element"". The 32-member alliance has agreed to initiate planning for long-term military support for Ukraine. Several countries have only backed the initiative in theory. Hungary, which has kept close ties with Russia, has warned it will not back ""any Nato proposals proposals that might draw the alliance closer to war or shift it from a defensive to an offensive coalition"". The Hungarian government has long sought to distance itself from international initiatives to fund Ukraine's fight against Russia, and for a period blocked a EU plan to provide a €50bn (£43bn) aid package for Ukraine. Mr Stoltenberg acknowledged the framework of support was yet to be decided, but said Nato foreign ministers had agreed on the principle: ""Make no mistake, Ukraine can rely on Nato support now and for the long haul."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters support for Ukraine within the alliance is ""rock solid"" and that he believes Ukraine will eventually become a member of Nato, Reuters reported. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters at Nato headquarters that while he did not want to ""spoil [Nato]'s birthday party"", his country needed help in improving its air defences - specifically Patriot missiles. ""Saving Ukrainian lives, saving the Ukrainian economy and saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of Patriots and other air defence systems,"" Mr Kuleba said. Lacking air superiority and faced with formidable Russian defences, Ukraine's counter-offensive ground to a halt last year and is now at risk of being outgunned on the front line in the east. The US has given Ukraine more financial aid than any other Nato state- more than $44bn (£34bn) since the 2022 invasion, according to the White House in December. However, its aid has now become caught up in a political row months before the presidential election. Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticised the level of spending. He has also long complained that the US has shouldered a greater financial burden than the rest of the alliance. Fewer than two-thirds of Nato members are on course to reach their 2% funding goal. Highlighting the importance of Nato's European allies to the US, Mr Stoltenberg noted it was America's allies that came to its help after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That was the only occasion that a key principle of the alliance has been invoked, in which an attack on one ally is seen as an attack on all. Nato allies closest to Russia have stepped up efforts to boost their armed forces. Norway is increasing its number of conscripted soldiers, while Denmark says it intends to extend conscription to women and increase the duration of service. Latvia and Sweden recently restarted military service, while Lithuania brought it back after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Derbyshire, from Coventry, helped create the Doctor Who theme tune as part of her innovative work at the BBC’s Radiophonic Workshop. Coventry University christened their new College of the Arts and Society building as the Delia Derbyshire building in its official opening on Thursday . ""The rediscovery and celebration of her work over the last decade or so has been fantastic,"" Mr Maconie said. The BBC Radio 6 Music presenter has produced documentaries about Derbyshire and written about her work and what she achieved. ""It shows we've come on a lot.

An event was held at the university on Thursday to mark the honour with performances from musicians. Ms Derbyshire was often cited as a major influence on electronic music and Shaun Hides, dean of the College of the Arts and Society, said he was ""super proud"" of the building which he hoped would inspire students and add to her legacy. He said the equipment was excellent and included 360-motion capture and 360-sound equipment as well as a film and photography studio. ""We've got an amazing building with amazing facilities for our students,"" he said. ""[Naming the building after Derbyshire] is absolutely fitting. ""Delia was a pioneer in her field.

Some 40,000 people heard rock legend Bruce Springsteen play classics like Born to Run and Hungry Heart. Groups were dressed in American Flag cowboy hats and boots, excited to see the Boss back in Belfast. Springsteen took to the stage at 19:30 BST to huge applause. Social media videos showed The Boss gifting a guitar pick to a young fan while performing Hungry Heart. The European leg of Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band World Tour kicked off in Cardiff on 5 May and Belfast is the second stop on the tour. Springsteen has played on the island of Ireland about 30 times in his five-decade career. In the crowd was nine-year-old Ceara along with her mum Christine and dad Eamonn Devlin. “This is Ceara’s first time seeing the boss. We are so excited we love him,” Christine said. Ceara said: “I am so excited to get to see Bruce Springsteen. ""It will be a brilliant night,” she added. Earlier, a County Antrim teenager told BBC News NI that singing and dancing on stage with Springsteen was an experience of a lifetime. Grace Lynch, from Portglenone, was just eight years old when she was plucked from the crowd at the King's Hall in Belfast to feature centre stage with the Boss in 2013. More than a decade on from that show, she said she was excited to go see the rock legend again, this time at Boucher Playing Fields. At his 2013 gig, Springsteen invited Grace on stage to help him sing Waitin' On A Sunny Day. He then lifted her and put her on his shoulders before handed her back to her father. Grace said she could not believe what happened but it is a very special memory.   “I don’t remember being nervous and I didn’t even pay much attention to the crowd,"" she continued. ""I just remember worrying I would forget the lyrics. ""His lyrics touch so many people for so many reasons. Bruce ‘The Boss’ is such a legend."" This experience has proved to be a real ice breaker for Grace on many occasions. She said it would be her father's dream to meet Springsteen on Thursday. “It would be my dad’s ultimate dream to meet Bruce in person."" Grace added she was ""looking forward to another ‘Sunny Day’ at Boucher tonight with all my family"". ""Can’t wait to Twist and Shout with Bruce.” After the Belfast gig, Springsteen will then make his way to the Republic of Ireland, with a date in Kilkenny at KK UPMC Nowlan Park on 12 May. Next he heads to Cork where to play SuperValu Pairc Ui Chaoimh, on 16 May; before going to Dublin where he is playing Croke Park on 19 May. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has advised there will be traffic disruption and a number of road closures in the Boucher area between midday and midnight on 9 May."

Denys Shmyhal expressed ""careful optimism"" that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has $61bn (£49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Russia says any fresh American aid for Ukraine will not make a difference on the battlefield, as the situation on the front line is looking ""unfavourable"" to Kyiv. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: ""We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today."" ""If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,"" he added. ""So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. ""Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War."" This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as ""complete nonsense"". Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Nato's collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesday's interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being ""infected"" by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: ""We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine."" Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress ""to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends"". Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was ""the only correct solution"". President Zelensky blamed an ""artificial deficit of weapons"" as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a ""catastrophic"" situation. President Biden has cited ""dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction"" as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivka's loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. ""We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,"" he said. ""Ukraine may come to feel it can't win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?"" Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed . Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - with some 40% of the national budget due to be devoted to defence and security in 2024, and deals struck with Iran and North Korea covering ammunition, missiles and drones."

They went down more than 15% in after-hours trading in New York despite the tech giant revealing strong earnings figures. Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would take some time before its huge AI investment increased revenues. Meta also said its X rival, Threads, now has more than 150 million monthly active users, increasing the pressure on the Elon Musk-owned platform. ""Threads is well on its way to beating X by becoming the Twitter alternative users and advertisers are longing for,"" said Mike Proulx, from analysts Forrester. He also said Meta stood to gain from TikTok's possible sale or ban in the US - a development the app has vowed to fight . Meta has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools to boost earnings growth. It has also been introducing more AI features on its social media platforms such as chat assistants. The firm said it now expected to spend between $35bn and $40bn, (£28bn-32bn) in 2024, up from an earlier prediction of $30-$37bn. For investors, that outweighed the positive news on earnings. First quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46bn, while analysts had expected earnings of $36.16bn. Analysts though said there was a logic to Meta's approach. Sophie Lund-Yates, from Hargreaves Lansdown, said Meta's ""substantial investment"" in AI has helped it get people to spend time on its platforms, so advertisers were willing to spend more money ""in a time when digital advertising uncertainty remains rife"". More than 50 countries are due to have elections this year, she said, ""which hugely increases uncertainty"" and can spook advertisers. Ms Lund-Yates said that ""looking further ahead, the biggest risk [for Meta] remains regulatory"". Last year, Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) by Ireland's data authorities for mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the US. And in February of this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced blistering criticism from US lawmakers and was pushed to apologise to families of victims of child sexual exploitation. Ms Lund-Yates added that the firm has ""more than enough resources to throw at legal challenges, but that doesn’t rule out the risks of ups and downs in market sentiment""."

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that UK gross domestic product - a key measure of economic health - will rise by 1% in 2025. This is below the rest of the G7 nations, which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. The OECD, which is a globally recognised think tank, said the UK economy would be “sluggish” this year. The organisation blamed the after-effects of a succession of interest rate rises in the UK for the lethargic performance. It also warned that some elements of inflation remained high and that uncertainty over when the Bank of England might change interest rates might put people off investing. The UK economy is now forecast to expand by 0.4% this year, a downgrade from the OECD's previous projection for 0.7% growth. It means that for this year only Germany will see slower growth, it said.  The OECD predicted that tax receipts in the UK would ""keep rising to historic highs"" of about 37% of GDP"". The government has cut National Insurance twice since last year, totalling a 4% reduction. But the OECD said this ""only partially offsets the ongoing fiscal drag from frozen personal income tax thresholds"". Fiscal drag means that as a person's salary rises, they can move into a higher income tax bracket. The organisation also said that a government scheme to allow businesses to deduct the full cost of investing in machinery and equipment from their tax bill does ""less than fully compensate"" for an increase in corporation tax which rose from 19% to 25% this time last year. But the OECD said that in the long-run these measures, as well as the government's free childcare scheme , ""could help to lower fiscal pressure"". Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the OECD's forecast showed the UK was ""winning the war"" against inflation. ""This forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates"", he wrote, adding that  ""growth matters"". But Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Today’s news that growth has been downgraded again reminds the British people what they already know: after 14 years of failure, the Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken."" Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of being ""economically illiterate"". ""Their no-growth policies have left the public enduring sky-high mortgage rates, the price of a weekly shop going through the roof, and stealth taxes hammering both pensioners and working people,"" said Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney. The Bank of England, which is independent from the government, sets interest rates and has a target to keep inflation at or close to 2%. Inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - has slowed significantly from a 40-year high it reached in October 2022 to 3.2% in April . Interest rates have been held at 5.25% since last September. The OECD expects the Bank to start cutting borrowing costs from this autumn. The think tank predicted that interest rates could fall to 3.75% by the end of next year. The forecasts aim to give a guide to what is most likely to happen in the future, but can be incorrect and do change. They are used by businesses to help plan investments, and by governments to guide policy decisions. "

His comments come after the US agreed a $61bn (£49bn) package of mostly military aid for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky said some of the aid had started to arrive, but added that it needed to be delivered faster. He was speaking alongside Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, who said ""it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail"". The comments come after authorities in the Black Sea port of Odesa said a Russian missile attack had killed four people and injured 32. Odesa's regional head Oleh Kiper said three women and one man had died, and the injured included a four-year-old and a 16-year-old, as well as a pregnant woman. Civilian houses and infrastructure had been damaged, he said. Earlier on Monday, Russia said it had taken a second village in two days in the course of its offensive in eastern Ukraine. At a joint press conference in Kyiv, President Zelensky said: ""The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of a situation when we are waiting for supplies from our partners, especially from the United States of America. ""And that is exactly why the speed of deliveries means stabilising the front."" He specifically singled out Ukraine's need for artillery shells and air defence systems. ""Our partners have all of these things and they should be working now here in Ukraine destroying the Russian terrorist ambitions. ""Russia's army is preparing for further offensive actions,"" said Mr Zelensky. Mr Stoltenberg agreed that Kyiv needed weapons, saying that ""Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition"". The Nato chief said the six-month delay in US military aid had resulted in ""serious consequences on the battlefield"". But Mr Stoltenberg added that he was optimistic that when the arms were delivered it would help turn the tide. ""Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs,"" said the Nato chief. Mr Stoltenberg also stressed that Ukraine would one day become a Nato member - a key strategic goal for Kyiv; but added that an official invitation at the alliance's Washington summit in July was unlikely. Russia said it had captured the village of Semenivka, which lies north of Avdiivka which Moscow took in February . On Sunday, Russia said the nearby village of Novobakhmutivka had fallen to its forces. Ukraine's commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said the situation on the frontline has worsened in the face of multiple Russian attacks, and that Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from positions in the eastern Donetsk region. Also on Monday, Ukraine's interior ministry said a 98-year-old woman had walked more than 10km (six miles) with two sticks under shelling from the partially occupied by Russia eastern village of Ocheretyne to Kyiv-controlled areas. ""I survived that war [World War Two], and I am going through this war,"" the woman, named only as Lidiya Stepanivna, is heard saying in the footage at an aid centre. She said she fell several times and had to rest on the ground during her escape. ""This war is not like that one,"" she added. ""Houses are burning and trees are being uprooted."" Earlier this month, the US finally approved billions of dollars in new military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion, putting an end to six months of congressional deadlock and raising Kyiv's hopes that its dwindling supplies would be restocked. Ukrainian forces have suffered from a shortage of ammunition and air defence systems in recent months. Officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory."

The measure - adopted after months of wrangling - is aimed at boosting numbers in the military, which is under severe pressure as Russia continues its advances in the east. But a clause aimed at demobilising soldiers after three years was dropped at the army's request. The president still has to sign the bill into law. Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelensky approved other measures, including lowering the age of mobilisation by two years, to 25. The new legislation passed on Thursday tightens registration processes and strengthens penalties for draft dodgers. MP Oleksandr Fedienko said, quoted by Reuters, that the bill would send a ""message to our partners that we are ready to retake our territory and we need weapons"". Ukraine's military has been under severe pressure of late, in part due to Russia's greater manpower. A senior general told MPs before the passing of the bill that Ukrainian forces were outnumbered by Russia by between seven and 10 to one. ""We are maintaining our defences with our last strength,"" joint forces commander Gen Yuriy Sodol said, quoted by Reuters. ""Pass this law and the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not let down you or the Ukrainian people."" A total of 283 MPs voted in favour of the bill, but 49 opposition lawmakers abstained. One of them, Oleksiy Goncharenko, said he could not vote for a bill that excluded demobilisation. ""The main question for those serving and those who might be potentially mobilised [is] 'how long will I serve?' Without this, I don't think the law will improve mobilisation,"" he said, quoted by the Financial Times. Protesters outside the parliament, many of whom have serving relatives, also criticised the exclusion. ""Our boys and girls in the service are very tired. They have been fighting for two years, and no-one is planning to replace them,"" Keteryna Kulibaba told Reuters. ""For rotation to happen, newcomers have to know how much time they'll have to spend [at the frontline]. ""Undefined mobilisation terms mean fighting forever. Without strictly defined terms, no-one will join the army."" The demobilisation issue will now be considered in a separate bill, parliament officials said. Draconian measures to prevent draft-dodging were also excluded from the latest version of the bill after a public outcry. The main provisions of the bill, which has not yet been published in full, include: The bill was passed hours after the country was hit by more heavy bombardments by Russia. More than 80 missiles and drones targeted sites across Ukraine, many of them involving energy infrastructure. The Trypillya power plant, a key provider of electricity for three regions including Kyiv, was completely destroyed . Ukraine has been asking Western countries to send more assistance, including ammunition and air defences. But a $60bn US military aid package has been held up for months in Congress."

And if you are a specialist maker of Japanese dumplings, like the brand Osaka Ohsho, then selling a packet of gyoza with some damaged is a big no-no. But as demand surged during the pandemic, its parent firm, Eat&Holdings, simply didn't have enough manpower to check every single dumpling, or keep up with demand. So it turned to technology for an answer. In January 2023, it opened a high-tech factory equipped with AI-powered cameras trained to detect any faulty gyoza on the production lines. Today this facility makes two dumplings every second. That's twice the speed of the other Osaka Ohsho production sites. ""By implementing AI, we have reduced the manpower on the manufacturing line by almost 30%,"" says spokeswoman Keiko Handa. The firm has also recently launched an AI-powered cooking robot called I-Robo at one of its Tokyo restaurants. As it takes time to train chefs, the company says the technology will help with the labour shortage issue. Japan's labour shortfall is only likely to get worse. The current population of 124.35 million has been falling for 13 years. And Japan's labour force is expected to continue to decline by 12% from 2022 to 2040, by which time it is estimated that the country will lack 11 million workers . Meanwhile, Asia's second-biggest economy is already home to the world's oldest population, with 29% of people aged 65 or above. The country also has one of the lowest birth-rates in the world, with only 758,631 babies born last year. That is the smallest number since records began in the 19th century. The government's efforts to boost its birth rates have met with little success . In the words of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, his country is ""on the brink of not being able to function"". Since AI took the world by storm, many have asked if our jobs will be stolen. But for some in Japan, AI cannot arrive fast enough. Farming is one of the fastest-ageing industries in the country, with the average age of a Japanese farmer now standing at 68.4 years. Here AI is being used to identify different types of diseases, pests and weeds for early detection and prevention. Nihon Nohyaku, which manufactures agricultural chemicals, has developed a smartphone app called Nichino AI. When a farmer takes a picture of struggling crops, the app gives a diagnosis of what is wrong and which pesticide may be needed. ""The accuracy rate is about 70 to 80%, so it is not as good as real experts, but better than ordinary farmers,"" says Kentarou Taniguchi from Nihon Nohyaku. ""The longer we work on this app, the more we realise how excellent the human experts are,"" he explains. ""But the number of experts is falling, so that is where AI tools can come in handy."" Farmer Kensuke Takahashi, who has been using the app for three years, agrees that AI is one of the tools that will help modernise the sector. ""The number of farmers is falling sharply like a rollercoaster,"" he says, ""but Japan's total amount of produce is increasing."" Mr Takahashi acknowledges that there are older farmers who may be sceptical of any new technologies such as AI, but he believes they are helping to increase efficiency levels. ""Once you try out a drone to spray pesticide, you cannot go back to manual spraying,"" he laughs. What about a sector that has always faced a shortage - language teachers? Despite the government's repeated efforts to increase the number of English speakers, Japan has constantly ranked low in English proficiency, due to the lack of teachers who can effectively speak the language. To try to overcome this shortfall, a start-up called Equmenopolis has developed an AI-powered online tool that allows users to have English conversations with its avatar for 15 minutes per session. It has so far been introduced at 50 schools across the country. At Narita Kokusai High School, on the outskirts of Tokyo, students were asked to use it at home to practice for three months at the end of last year. ""AI decides what kind of English conversations each student can have and varies its questions,"" teacher Shoko Takiguchi tells the BBC. ""It is difficult to have one-on-one conversations with every student so that was an advantage."" At the end of each conversation, students get feedback in six areas including pronunciation, grammar, fluency and vocabulary. ""With AI, it is easy to find out what my weakness was, so it was efficient,"" says one of the students, Ko Hanyuan. But asked if he would choose AI over his online tutorial, he says no. Why? It lacks the human touch. Ms Takiguchi agrees: ""It is useful to improve your speaking skills, but I found conversations to be unnatural."" She adds that the AI is unable to assess the user's reaction, physical condition, or change in tone. So it won't replace human teachers? ""AI can not and should not replace English lessons at school or teachers,"" emphasises the school's principal Katsutoshi Fukumizu. Governments in Japan are also experimenting with AI. Faced with labour shortages, Yokosuka City in Kanagawa prefecture has starting using AI chatbot ChatGPT to help with administrative tasks such as transcribing and summarising meetings. ""We deal with enormous amount of documents, and it takes a very long time and effort to create those documents,"" says the city's spokesperson Kohei Ota. Thanks to ChatGPT, ""we have calculated after our trial that we save 22,700 hours of work annually,"" he adds. At the national government's Digital Agency, which was established in 2021 to overcome inefficiency in public administration, AI is also used to train its staff. ""There are so many things that we want to do, but our manpower hasn't been able to keep up,"" says Masanori Kusunoki from the agency. He adds that the government is trying to ""explore how we can use AI, and spread the information"" to the private sector. But Mr Kusunoki doesn't think that the rise of AI will mean fewer workers are needed. In a country where changes happen slowly, Japan is embracing the power of AI with less reluctance than others. That is because it has looked into every possible solution to tackle the double whammy of an ageing and shrinking population for more than a decade: from robots, to women, the elderly and foreign workers. While AI may help increase the efficiency of the workforce, it is nowhere near ready to replace human workers."

Meat and dairy products, plants and seeds are among the goods now subject to physical checks when imported to Britain from the European Union from Tuesday. Businesses have warned the trade checks, which will see import costs increase immediately, are expected to hit smaller companies hardest and lead to price rises being passed on to customers for certain products. John Davidson, co-owner of flower company Tom Brown Wholesale, said he expected the checks to cost his business between £200,000 and £225,000 per year. ""Usually we try and absorb as much as we can, but those sorts of costs... [it's] just not possible to absorb everything,"" he said. The second phase of border controls kicked in from midnight and have been introduced as part of the UK's Brexit trade agreement. The government said its new border model would ""improve our biosecurity"", adding the costs for businesses would be ""negligible compared to the impact of a major outbreak of a plant or animal disease"", such as foot and mouth. The UK officially left the EU four years ago, but it has taken some time for the new trade rules to be implemented - legally required under the Brexit agreement - for goods travelling from the bloc to the British Isles. Health certificates were introduced in January on EU goods ranging from cut flowers, to fresh produce including meat, fruit and vegetables, but on Tuesday, physical checks for the goods have come into force. British exporters trading in the other direction have already faced increased red tape for three years. The introduction of such UK border controls is reversing the free flow of such goods, which had been allowed under the EU single market since 1993. The physical checks will be carried out based on the ""risk"" category that goods fall into. For example, the government said high-risk goods, such as live animals, will be subject to identity and physical checks for pests and diseases at the border. Products that present a medium risk to biosecurity will also be checked, while low-risk goods, such as canned meat will not require any checks. The new checks are not yet being applied to goods from the Republic of Ireland, which is a major supplier of food to the UK. The UK government says the checks on Irish goods will not happen before November. But businesses, especially smaller companies, have raised concerns that the new checks could disrupt supply chains and increase costs, with importers having to pay £29 per shipment of particular products. If multiple types of product are being imported by one business, such as meat, fish and cheese, the company will have to pay £29 per category, up to a maximum of £145 per consignment. The government has forecast the charges will cost British firms about £330m per year. Mr Davidson told BBC Breakfast his ""bigger worry"" was how the physical checks would work in practice. ""These products are already checked in Holland. From an industry point of view the communication has really been lacking. ""At the moment Defra (the government department) is saying they are going to use [a] light-touch approach to checking. What does that actually mean? We just want some real clarity on it."" While the checks are coming into force on Tuesday, it is understood the number of them will be very low to start with as traders become accustomed to the new rules. The government has acknowledged that the extra red tape and checks will increase food prices, but not as much as seen in recent times. It has forecast the controls could push up inflation by 0.2 percentage points over three years. But Lucy Neville-Rolfe, minister at the Cabinet Office, said the new checks were essential to improve the UK’s biosecurity. ""We cannot continue with temporary measures which leave the UK open to threats from diseases and could do considerable damage to our livelihoods, our economy and our farming industry,"" she said. On Tuesday, Trade Minister Greg Hands and Exports Minister Lord Garvel were asked about the checks by the Business Select Committee. ""I know there's been frustration expressed on all sides of the equation, but the objective has been to try and minimise the cost and minimise the disruption"", Lord Garvel told the committee. ""When you bring in anything new, of course people are concerned and there is uncertainty, and this is a dynamic situation,"" he added. Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers Union, said the group welcomed the checks ""as a way of safeguarding the nation's food safety"". “British farmers and growers need controls on all imports, not just those from the EU, to be effective, biosecure and efficient. That looks different for the individual sectors in agriculture, dependent on business need,"" he said. Britain imports 22% of its beef, 21% of its sheep meat and 49% of its pork, and relies on the EU for the bulk of those imports, due to consumer demand outstripping supply, according to the British Meat Processors Association. The industry body said with ""so little clear explanation"" of how the new import checks will be rolled out, it had been ""very difficult to gauge the impact on meat supplies, even after four years of preparation"". It said it suspected that larger importers would not be adversely affected, but warned that smaller importers would be. Jamie Collins, of family-run food retailer Hamish Johnston in London, told the BBC his business would probably have to put prices up a bit to maintain its profit margins. ""We import quite a lot of cheese every week from France. Every import we bring over on a weekly basis is looking to get an extra £220 added on to the cost,"" he said. Food price increases have been a major driver of the overall cost of living increasing in the UK in recent years, with food price inflation - the rate at which goods are getting more expensive - at 4% in the year to March. The pace of food price rises has eased in recent months, but the cost of staples such as cheese, bread and milk are much higher than they were in 2020. Martin McTague, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said its members were ""still unsure"" about the trade checks. “They have already been delayed five times so there’s really no excuse not to have communicated what’s going on to small firms,"" he said. He said the ""ripple effect"" of increased costs would lead to businesses having to raise prices, reduce their offering or ""shut up shop entirely"".

Those buying a first home were increasingly reliant on having two high incomes or receiving parental support, it said. Others have been priced out and ""stuck"" in renting from private landlords. Building societies account for a quarter of mortgage lending, and their association suggests the market needs to change to allow more people to buy a home. Mortgage rates are relatively high compared with the last decade, and the cost of renting has also soared. Latest official figures showed private rental costs in the UK have risen by 9.2% in the last year. The BSA's report, written by housing analyst Neal Hudson, suggests home ownership among younger people has been in decline over the last 20 years. First-time buyers faced the dual affordability struggle of raising a deposit to buy a home as well as paying a mortgage. Although the cost of a deposit had been difficult for some time, the recent increases in mortgage interest rates had tightened the squeeze, the report said. Paul Broadhead, head of mortgage and housing policy at the BSA, said: ""Becoming a first-time buyer is possibly the most expensive it has been over at least the last 70 years, but a properly functioning housing market is dependent on first-time buyers being able to afford their first home. ""New thinking and radical changes are needed."" At present, buying a home required two above-average incomes, the report said. House price growth has been higher than earnings growth for some time. Separate figures published on Monday by the property portal Rightmove suggest much of the activity in the housing market since the start of the year was among large, four-bedroom homes. They will be out of reach for the vast majority of first-time buyers, but Rightmove also said asking prices were starting to accelerate again. A number of mortgage lenders have also started the week by raising the interest rates on new fixed-rate deals. They are responding to a view on the markets that the Bank of England may not lower the benchmark interest rate as early or as often as previously thought. The Resolution Foundation think tank recently said that the most common living arrangement for an adult aged between 18 and 34 in 1997 was being in a couple with children, but now it was living with your parents. Half of first-time buyers in their 20s were getting help of an average of £25,000 from their parents, it said. In January, Sir Howard Davies, who chairs NatWest, was criticised for suggested it was not ""that difficult"" to get on the housing ladder. He later said he meant access to mortgages was easier. But the BSA report suggested otherwise, and argued that more ""flexibility"" was required on regulation such as the limits on lending when borrowers can only pay a small deposit. Wider issues are facing first-time buyers, such as concerns over rising house prices in rural areas. The County Councils Network said house prices in rural counties were the most unaffordable outside London. Sophie Brown, who rents in the Cotswolds, told the BBC in March that she was priced out of buying in the area. ""A lot of people are coming from London with their second homes ... pricing out the normal everyday person with a normal job,"" she said. ""Local people are having issues trying to buy houses."" The BSA said whichever government was in power after the general election should commission a review of the first-time buyer market and use all its powers to help those wanting to buy their first home.

The promised monthly salary - 204,000 roubles ($2,201; £1,739) - seemed a huge amount to the school-dropout fisherman from the southern Indian state of Kerala. Weeks later, Mr Moothappan, 23, found himself on the warfront in the Russian-held city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. ""It's death and destruction everywhere,"" he says, when asked about his time there. He and another man from Kerala managed to return home last week. They are among several Indians who were duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces in the country's war with Ukraine over the past few months. A few have managed to make their way back home but others are still stuck in Russia. Most of them are from poor families and were lured with the promise of jobs, sometimes as ""helpers"" in the Russian army. At least two Indians have died so far in the war. India's foreign ministry has said it is ""pressing very hard with the Russian authorities"" to bring back its citizens who have been tricked into fighting in the war. Last week, foreign minister S Jaishankar called this ""a matter of very, very deep concern"" for India. The BBC has emailed the Russian embassy in India for comment. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing. Mr Moothappan is relieved to be back home in the fishing village of Pozhiyoor in Kerala, but says he can't forget what he saw in the war. ""There were body parts strewn all over the ground,"" he says. Distraught, he started vomiting and almost fainted. ""Soon, the Russian officer commanding us told me to return to the camp. It took hours for me to recover,"" he says. He says he broke his leg around Christmas while fighting in a ""remote place"" - his family, he says, didn't know about his situation at that time. Mr Moothappan spent two and a half months in different hospitals in Luhansk, Volgograd and Rostov before recovering partially. In March, a group of Indians helped him reach the country's embassy in Moscow, which then arranged for him to travel back home. Some 61km away in Anchuthengu, another fishing hamlet in Kerala, Prince Sebastian has a similar story of escape - and trauma - to tell. Duped by a local agent, he was deployed in a group of 30 fighters in the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian town of Lysychansk. After just three weeks of training, he says he was sent to the frontline with several weapons including an RPG-30 (a handheld, disposable rocket-propelled grenade launcher) and bombs, which prevented him from moving quickly. Fifteen minutes after he reached the front, he says a bullet fired from close range deflected off the tank he was in and pierced below his left ear. He fell - on to what he realised was a dead Russian soldier. ""I was shocked and I couldn't move. After an hour, as the night fell, another bomb exploded. It badly injured my left leg."" He spent the night in a trench, bleeding. He escaped the next morning and subsequently spent weeks in different hospitals. He then got a month's leave to rest. During this time, a priest helped him contact the Indian embassy which then issued him a temporary passport and arranged for his return home. He says two of his friends who went with him, also fishermen, are still missing. Neither he nor their families have heard from them in weeks. Officials in Kerala say they have so far received complaints from the families of four men - Mr Moothappan, Mr Sebastian and his two friends - about being duped by agents. Mr Sebastian says he and his friends went to a local agent in their village to check if they could find jobs somewhere in Europe (the man is currently absconding). The agent suggested Russia, speaking of a ""golden opportunity"" to work as a security guard for a monthly salary of 200,000 rupees ($2,402; £1,898). They agreed instantly. The friends paid 700,000 rupees each to him for a Russian visa. On 4 January, they reached Moscow, where an Indian agent identified as Alex, who spoke their language, Malayalam, welcomed them. They spent the night in a flat, following which a man took them to a military officer in the city of Kostroma, 336km (208 miles) away, where they were made to sign a contract in Russian, a language they couldn't read, Mr Sebastian said. Three Sri Lankan recruits also joined them there. Then the six men were taken to a military camp in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine. The officers took their passports and mobile phones. The training started on 10 January. In the following days, they learnt how to use handheld anti-tank grenades and what to do if they were injured. After this, they were taken to a secondary base known as the Alabino Polygon. There, the training continued for 10 days, ""day and night"". ""All kinds of armaments were waiting for us there,"" Mr Sebastian said. ""I started enjoying the weapons like toys."" But the brutal reality of the war hit him on the battlefield. Now, he is hoping to resume fishing. ""I have to repay the money I borrowed from lenders and restart my life,"" he says. In Pozhiyoor, Mr Moothappan hopes to do the same. ""I was engaged to a girl in my village when I left. I told her I'll return with money and build a house before our marriage,"" he said. Now the couple have decided to wait for two more years as Mr Moothappan tries to rebuild his life. But he's happy that at least he didn't kill anyone in his time on the battlefield. ""One time, the Ukrainians were some 200m away. We were asked to go on the offensive but I didn't fire a single shot at them,"" he said. ""I can't kill anybody."""

Mr Johnson has stalled a House vote on a $96bn package aimed at helping both US allies, while he faces pressure from fellow members of his Republican Party. But he said an Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend had increased the urgency to sign off new foreign aid. Mr Johnson said the separate aid bills could be put to a vote this week. Ukraine has grown impatient as its ammunition supplies dwindle, with Russia making steady territorial gains after its full-scale invasion entered a third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for his allies to show the same unity they have shown Israel, highlighting ""the intensity of Russian attacks"". But right-wing Republicans - whose party narrowly control the House - have increasingly questioned American support for Kyiv due to its expense. Among them are Donald Trump, the party's likely 2024 presidential candidate. Mr Johnson had previously attempted to make Republican support for foreign aid conditional on President Joe Biden tightening US border security - a move that ultimately failed. The Speaker has also been resisting a threat to oust him by Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who opposes what she sees as compromises made with rival Democrats. Following months of political deadlock over the aid, Mr Johnson pledged American support following events in the Middle East over the weekend that concerned another US ally, Israel. Israel came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones, following an earlier strike on an Iranian consulate building in Syria for which Israel is widely believed to have been responsible. ""There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully and we know that the world is watching us to see how we react,"" Mr Johnson said on Monday. He went on to launch a verbal attack on ""terrorists and tyrants and terrible leaders around the world"", which he said included the leaders of Russia and Iran. Mr Johnson went on to explain that the $96bn  (£77bn) package of mixed aid - which had already been approved in the upper chamber - would not be put to a vote in its ""current form"". Instead, he said, ""we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces"". It is thought these votes could happen by Friday evening. The aid - whether presented in separate bills or bundled back into one - would then have to be put to the Senate again. The White House has opposed any ""standalone"" measure that supports Israel solely. Writing on X, Mr Johnson explained that the newly-separated bills were intended to support not only Ukraine and Israel, but also ""strengthen our allies in the Indo-Pacific (and) pass additional measures to counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security."" The package passed by the Senate also included assistance for Taiwan. Mr Johnson has previously expressed support for legislation that would structure new Ukraine support in the form of loans - suggesting costs could be covered by authorising the US government to seize and sell Russian assets frozen since the start of the Ukraine war. This component could also be voted on this week as part of the proposed package of measures."

The team behind the world's most advanced methane-monitoring satellite, MethaneSat , are keen on metaphors about cleaning. ""About the size of a washing machine,"" was how environmental scientist Steven Wofsy, described the orbiting object at a press conference ahead of its launch. ""Like a push-broom,"" was his phrase for its capacity to scan the surface of the Earth. The metaphors are apt. Methane is a particularly dirty greenhouse gas, driving about 30% of the heating the planet has experienced so far. It breaks down in the atmosphere in just 12 years, which is much sooner than the centuries taken by CO2 – but it is also around 80 times more powerful over a 20-year time span. With 60% of global methane emissions coming from human activities, reductions are essential to reaching the world's climate change targets . Equally, if not addressed in a timely way, it could contribute to the passing of dangerous tipping points that lead to rapid and irreversible change around the globe. MethaneSat aims to help by providing an independent source of methane monitoring, with a primary focus on methane leaked from oil and gas fields – such as the recent, months-long mega leak in Kazakhstan , which resulted in the release of 127,000 tonnes of the potent gas. By supplementing existing satellite data with even more precise measurements, MethaneSat hopes to provide a near-comprehensive view of global leaks. Yet the oil and gas industry is also far from the only source of human-caused methane emissions. Agriculture is in fact the largest human source of methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, at almost 40%. Energy is in second at around 37% , and waste in third. Within agriculture, flooded rice fields account for 8% of total human-linked emissions, but belches and manure from livestock are the biggest contributors, with cattle the biggest single offenders. In California, the non-profit coalition Climate Trace found that one single cattle feedlot produced more methane than the state's biggest oil and gas fields. ""If we don't reduce emissions from the food system we won't meet the 1.5C target,"" sums up Mario Herrero, a professor of sustainable food systems at Cornell University in New York, who oversaw the methane calculations used in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. ""Animal numbers are increasing like crazy , thus methane is increasing. We have to reduce emissions from livestock."" So why is farming's methane taking the back-seat in terms of global attention? And what can be done to address this climate-action blindspot? The rationale for focussing on oil and gas activities is that easy wins should be tackled first. ""If you're looking to have the biggest impact and make the biggest difference, it's reasonable to focus on oil and gas first,"" according to Mark Brownstein, a senior vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the environmental non-profit funding MethaneSat and working in partnership with Google on the project. ""There's fewer actors involved than in agriculture,"" he told reporters. And ""there's also the resources there to solve it"". Conversely, agriculture's methane output is more elusive. Aerial remote sensing measurements, such as those taken from aircraft or drones, can capture methane leaks, says Aaron Davitt, principal analyst on remote sensing for the non-profit WattTime , but these technologies can only be deployed in limited regions for limited amounts of time.

This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here . Plus, even knowing where to direct remote sensors or satellites to look in the first place can be fraught, adds Sam Schiller, chief executive of Carbon Yield , a firm that helps farmers adapt to climate change. ""In most parts of the world, public datasets of livestock facilities are hard to come by."" So can more precise satellites help? ""In the last five years, satellites have revolutionised our knowledge and understanding of methane emissions for the better,"" says Antoine Halff, chief analyst and co-founder at Kayrros , an environmental intelligence company. ""Thanks to satellites, we can not only track the large emissions events known as 'super-emitters' with great accuracy, but also measure overall emissions at the basin or country level. Importantly, we can do so in a way that is completely independent and verifiable."" According to Sara Mikaloff-Fletcher, a biogeochemical scientist at National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, who is leading MethaneSat's agricultural research, that capacity will only increase in relation to agriculture too. The new satellite's ability to map methane at a precision of 2 ppb (parts per billion) means it will be the first satellite well suited to measuring agricultural emissions, she says. ""That number might not mean a lot to your readers, but to me it is the same precision I could get from an instrument on the ground – which is extraordinary."" There are still technical limitations, however. In terms of methane from livestock, small groups of animals pose problems for satellite monitoring, as do farms in places where agriculture is not the primary emissions source. ""I'm also not sure how well we will be able to do sheep, which have smaller emissions than cows,"" Mikaloff-Fletcher adds.  On rice production, meanwhile, satellites cannot see through cloud and nearby wetlands can complicate the data: ""It is going to be more challenging,"" she says.  There are also limitations as a result of policy. A Global Methane Pledge to reduce emissions by at least 30% by 2030, agreed at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, does not include an agriculture target. The agreement only talks about providing farmers with ""incentives and partnerships"", rather focusing on ""all feasible reductions"" that the energy industry is tasked with, says Nusa Urbanic, chief executive at Changing Markets Foundation , a campaign organisation. This reluctance to confront agriculture's emissions problem can be seen at a national level too. The US has a provision that exempts farmers from giving detailed emissions accounts. The EU recently removed a target for agricultural methane from its new 2040 climate goal. Why the reluctance? According to Halff, while fossil fuel companies are ""treated as certified carbon villains"", there is a ""different aura around farming"" where small family farms can sit alongside larger, corporate operations. There are some positive moves from industry to tackle the problem. A Dairy Methane Action Alliance has seen six of the world's largest dairy companies sign up to reducing their output, says Marcelo Mena, the former environment minister of Chile and now chief executive of the philanthropic Global Methane Hub. The meat sector, however, ""has not shown the same level of commitment, and needs to do a lot more"". The key to further progress, Herrero emphasises, is ""less but better"" production of livestock. Methane from enteric fermentation – especially cow burps – is tricky to solve, but new breeding and feeding techniques could help. (Read more about how New Zealand is reducing methane emissions from farming .) Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. Experiments with red algae in dairy-cow's feed suggest it may achieve reductions in methane, Herrero says. Meanwhile, in Japan, over 35% of food waste is recycled as pig feed, helping create a more circular food economy. But human diets may still be the ultimate blind spot holding up methane reduction. Of various measures that the EU could adopt to reach the UN Environment Programme's recommendation of a 40-45% reduction of global methane by 2030, a Changing Markets report found that 50% of consumers would need to eat less meat and dairy . You might also like: More information on the extent of agriculture's methane problem could help shift this reluctance, for politicians and consumers alike. And here, once again, more independent monitoring and reporting will be key, says Herrero. Not just satellites are needed, he says, but methane sensors in individual barns. Plus a global methane observatory to coordinate the data. If contributing to the latter was part of the Paris Agreement and nations' individual pledges on climate action, it could help ""ensure continuous monitoring"". Ultimately though, Herrero reflects, ""we can't wait to have the perfect monitoring system to act on methane. ""We need to keep trying things, even though our knowledge is imperfect."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Getting ever more desperate, the fictional British TV presenter suggests shows such as Inner City Sumo, Youth Hostelling With Chris Eubanks, and finally, Monkey Tennis. All were perhaps unsurprisingly rejected. Maybe Partridge, played by comedian and actor Steve Coogan, would have had better luck if he had let an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system pick the ideas. That may initially sound like a highly fanciful idea, but a number of TV production companies have already announced that they are using AI to help them dream up new programmes. These include RTL Group, whose subsidiaries make everything from The X Factor, to The Apprentice, Grand Designs and QI. It said last year that it had ""started to support content creation with generative AI."" Meanwhile, Banijay, which makes Deal or No Deal and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, now has a fund to back AI-created content. Announcing this last year, it said: ""While human creativity will always prevail, it's important to work alongside the tools which are available to contribute to the future of ground-breaking entertainment."" While neither firm has yet to unveil a new TV series whose idea came from an AI system, I decided to put one to the test. So I logged into an AI chatbot, and typed in what I was looking for. I wrote: ""I am trying to think up a new TV format. A series with contestants. ""Maybe they would be learning a new skill, like dancing, or perhaps they are trying to compete in communities to have the most sustainable environment. Can you help me with some ideas?"" The AI confirms that this could be an exciting endeavour. And instantly comes up with six ideas. I like its first suggestion - Skills Mastery Showdown - where contestants would be paired with skilled mentors, and have a limited time to master a specific new skill, such as dancing, cooking or painting. But what do TV industry experts think about the use of AI in coming up with future content? I ask Dan Whitehead, who is a senior consultant at K7 Media, a Manchester-based research firm that reports on the TV business. ""The idea of a machine that you can type a request into, in normal conversational language, and have it spit out something close to what you asked for, still feels pretty magical,"" he says. ""So it's understandable that people are drawn to it. ""Can something like [AI chatbot] ChatGPT generate ideas for a TV show? Of course, but then ideas for TV shows have never been in short supply. The big problem for most production companies is the uncertainty - which ideas are best, which ones are worth investing in?"" Mr Whitehead argues that AI can give people false confidence, giving them the sense that if it - with access to billions of data points - can come up with these ideas, they must somehow be better. I look back at Skills Mastery Showdown. Maybe it's not that innovative after all.  Mr Whitehead says that AI is better used in a much more nuanced, background way. ""The BBC's Springwatch and Winterwatch use a bespoke AI system that monitors live camera feeds, and has been trained to recognise, record and log different species of animals and birds as they appear in the frame,"" he says. ""It can then tell the production team how often they appear, give behavioural insights, and generally do something that would eat up hours of human production time."" Eline van Der Velden, founder and chief executive of London-based TV production firm Particle 6, is more positive about using AI to both help come up with ideas for new programmes, and to write scripts. She says that recently she had two versions of a script ready for a client, one edited by humans, and the other by Chat GPT. ""We gave them both versions, and they preferred the ChatGPT one,"" she says. Ms van Der Velden adds that she wants her producers to know how to use AI to help them do their job. ""[Otherwise] it's like having someone who doesn't know how Microsoft Word works,"" she says. ""It speeds everything up."" She also says that AI isn't replacing jobs in TV, or at least not all of them. ""It's like when accountants thought they'd be out of work with the advent of Excel. ""You still need a creative director, but this is a tool that programme makers should use. It will enable us to reach the next level of our full potential."" Read more stories on artificial intelligence I still want to see if AI can help me make a hit TV programme? What about a drama series instead? Mr Whitehead reminds me that AI is not human, that it will never have an emotional response to any requests or prompts that I give it. Undeterred, I asked my AI chatbot for ideas for a new TV show about the Post Office scandal. It comes back with a six-part series called ""Broken Trust"", which will combine drama and documentary elements to ""engage viewers emotionally, while providing factual insights into the larger issues at play. Mr Whitehead is not impressed, describing it as ""about as generic a description of a programme on this subject as I can imagine"". He adds that ITV's hit show on the topic - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - could not have been dreamed up by AI. ""That needed human beings to see the human story, to trust that there was interest in that story,"" says Mr Whitehead. ""No algorithm would ever have predicted that as one of the biggest shows of Christmas 2023, yet here we are. ""In fact most of the big hit shows - scripted and unscripted - came about because someone took a punt on a leftfield idea or unlikely combination of ideas that nobody was sure would work. I don't think AI will ever replicate that essential random spark."" However, Ms van Der Velden thinks it soon will. ""AI helps us with scripts, topics for children's shows... The only thing it hasn't done yet, is come up with a great TV format - something like the Traitors. But it will. Just give it six months."""

politics,politics,Negative,"['Hamas', 'the United Nations', 'The US Congress', 'BBC', 'Hamas', 'the Washington Post', 'Hamas', 'the US State Department', 'the Israel Defense Forces']",Gaza war: US bomb delay biggest warning yet for Israel,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68978322,2024-05-08,0.13987897463134868,Scandal,False,Landfill overflow,"The United States is the one country that has real leverage over Israel. And yet, throughout the war in Gaza, Israel has chosen to ignore much of the advice of its closest ally. The US government says its support for the war against Hamas is ""ironclad"", but it has repeatedly raised concerns about the failure of the Israeli army to protect civilians and the lack of humanitarian access afforded to the people of Gaza. For seven long months, the US has gradually stepped up pressure on Israel. It has advised privately. It has warned publicly. It has stopped vetoing condemnatory resolutions at the United Nations. It has sanctioned Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. In a particularly robust telephone call a month ago, President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would reduce US support if Israel did not allow fleets of aid lorries to cross the border into Gaza. And yet, much of this counsel and cajoling has fallen on deaf ears. So now the US is beginning to wield its biggest stick. The US is by far Israel's biggest source of weapons and ammunition. By law, it provides Israel with $3.8bn (£3bn) of military aid each year, designed to give the country an advantage over neighbouring countries. The US Congress last month passed a bill providing a further $14bn of military support. Now the Biden administration has for the first time delayed a shipment of munitions to Israel. A senior administration official confirmed to the BBC that the delivery of thousands of 2000lb and other bombs has been paused. The official said they were also reviewing other weapons sales, including equipment that helps convert free-falling bombs into precision-guided munitions. So why is the US finally reaching for perhaps its biggest lever of influence over Israel? A first answer is the proposed military operation against Hamas in Rafah. The US and many Western countries fear this would lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe. US officials say the bombs they have delayed are the kind that might be used in Rafah and would have devastating consequences in dense urban settings. The US does not want Israel to attack Rafah and this is another way of reinforcing that message. One US official told the Washington Post this was a ""shot across the bow"" to show Israel the seriousness of US concerns. A second answer is the US government's desire to maintain pressure on Israel's cabinet to support a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Negotiations continue in Cairo and Washington may want to increase the costs that Israel may face for failing to agree a compromise. A third reason is surely domestic US politics. President Biden is coming under huge pressure from Democratic supporters to temper his support for Israel. It is election year in the US and opinion pollsters are suggesting that some Democrats - especially younger people - may be reluctant to come out and vote for Mr Biden in November because of the US role in the war in Gaza. Low turnout could hit him hard in his battle with Donald Trump. Any decision to withhold military support for Israel comes with risks for the US. Israel could once again simply ignore what its ally was saying and doing. It could effectively call Washington's bluff and trust that US military support would continue in the long term. That would be a very public demonstration of diminishing US influence in the world. But equally, Israel might be loath to risk an historic rift with its biggest ally, one upon whom it relied utterly for the air defences that protected it from a mass Iranian drone and missile attack just a few weeks ago. A big test will come when the US State Department decides whether the Israel Defense Forces are using US weapons to commit human rights abuses. A statement about an inquiry is expected soon. Finally, the US is not Israel's only ally. And if the US delays arms sales to Israel, then pressure will grow on other countries to do the same, including the UK. Such restrictions would be more symbolic than actual. But they would contribute to Israel's diplomatic isolation."

When Manchester-based Lucy Clark first logged on to the viral retail app Temu in 2023, she felt like she was in a virtual casino. A spinning roulette wheel touted tantalising cash coupon rewards; countdown timers – precariously close to running out – promised free delivery; and lightning bolts advertising flash discount deals streaked across her screen. ""I'd heard about Temu on TikTok, with people showing off their hauls and sharing promotional codes,"" says the 27-year-old marketing director. ""Everyone I know has at least been on Temu [once] and had a look. I wasn't searching for anything in particular."" Barraged with a bewildering array of dirt-cheap home gadgets, electronic devices and novelty items, Clark decided to buy some squeaky dog toys for Rickson, her mother's French Bulldog. They cost a fraction of the price she'd pay at retail stores like Pets at Home or even online at Amazon. She was unfazed by Temu's two-week delivery window – glacial by Amazon's standards, but realistic according to her experience with Shein, where Clark has shopped for several years. ""I could pay extra to get it expedited,"" says Clark, ""but I'm never that desperate for the stuff I'm ordering."" Temu's eclectic emporium of stuff is just that – rarely are they necessities, but the scrapyard symphony has something for everyone. If you've imagined it – and perhaps even if you haven't – Temu has it: from beard-trimming bibs to mini toilet golf, tiny printers, avocado slicers or swanky hoodies for your car's gear stick. Clark knows quality isn't guaranteed, but she writes that off as just a part of the shopping experience. ""You're either going to get something really good and an absolute bargain. Or you get something that's a bit naff, but won't actually return it, because it's less than £10 so it's not worth your time,"" she says. Temu's approach to pricing and how it promotes products, say experts, is deliberate – pushing the exact consumer psychology buttons necessary to keep shoppers shopping. And ""gamification"" – the practice of implementing gaming-related elements into the ecommerce experience – is increasingly common. Customers are encouraged to keep shopping with the introduction of bonuses and coupons that mimic the rewards you might accumulate in a video game. Now, brands worldwide are attempting to cash in on this phenomenon, incorporating spin to win features, quizzes and elabourate referral systems on their sites. Even iconic brands such as Starbucks and Sephora have added gamified elements to their online reward programmes; Lacoste has a crocodile hunt game in which shoppers unlock prizes in its virtual store. Few brands, however, do all these things simultaneously and as conspicuously as Temu. The billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform is designed to get consumers' brains firing on all cylinders, and stoke the frenzied shopping for which they're now famous. What is Temu's secret – and does its formula set the stage for the future of shopping? ""Temu is as addictive as sugar,"" says retail analyst Neil Saunders. ""The experience and cheap prices give consumers a little dopamine hit and keeps them coming back for more."" Regular promotions increase engagement, he adds, and the chaotic interface of the website creates the illusion for consumers that they can ""dive in"" and rummage around to discover a great deal – especially finding them if they move quickly. Mark Griffiths , professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University, UK, agrees. ""They've mixed shopping and gamification really well. Temu's marketing strategy means you are literally having to browse to get your rewards."" He explains that Temu utilises the ""perceived urgency aspect"" by using timers and countdowns to convince customers that deals are running out. He likens it to the strategy behind slot machines, where the sounds associated with button pushing heighten arousal levels. Temu has even carved a space separate from brands such as Shein, even though the two are often compared, as ultra-fast fashion brands are known for eye-wateringingly low prices. While both are often in the headlines for competitive rivalries , Temu takes gamification one step further. ""Temu often employs a combination of social proof, scarcity and frequently uses animated elements to capture consumers' attention, more so than Shein and Wish,"" explains Vilma Todri , an associate professor of Information Systems at Goizueta Business School at Emory University, US, who researches the impact of Internet-related technologies on consumer behaviour and previously worked at Google. The retailer also relies heavily on social proof as ""a highly effective persuasive technique,"" adds Todri. If something catches your eye, there's a slew of ways Temu keeps you engaged with the product. A shopper may see a product's review and number of five-star ratings, how many people purchased it in the past 24 hours and the number of customers who currently have the product in their carts. All this, explains Todri, provides evidence of the product's supposed quality and popularity, psychologically tapping in to our desire to conform or join in. Some users claim Temu's tactics work so well, they've become addicted to the sales platform. Griffiths is sceptical of the claim. Barring a small minority of individuals with the propensity to spend more than 10 hours shopping online each day, he believes it is unlikely Temu alone could be an all-consuming addiction in the clinical sense of the word . Still, the gaming elements could drive consumers to part with their money unwisely. ""I don't think people would spend all day, every day on Temu... but like gambling, shopping is a commercial activity and even if you're not spending great amounts of time, you might be going beyond your disposable income,"" he says. Addiction or not, a steady drip-feed of these marketing tactics can have a lasting effect. Luring consumers with the promise of free gifts, ""[Temu] then kind of takes you down a spiral"", says Griffiths, and many consumers share anecdotally there always seems to be one last hurdle before the promised reward, such as referring more friends. If consumers are so drawn to these types of marketing approaches, other brands may be tempted to adopt them, too – or even feel like they have no choice if they want to compete with the behemoth that is Temu. Yet even if they do take a similar approach – integrating gamified shopping and rock-bottom prices – it doesn't guarantee success. In fact, say experts, Temu may be impossible to compete with, mostly due to its business model. First, Temu is able to offer such low prices because they're betting on a long-term strategy of operating at a loss in order to scale to the point that they squeeze out nearly all competition. Elizabeth Clark, cofounder and CEO at Dream AI ltd, a UK-based AI company that specialises in ecommerce is already seeing the threat of Temu play out in the UK market . ""You can't compete on price with Temu. It's a tremendous business case. They've not had to put money into the logistics or the manufacturers. [It's] a poor man's, accelerated version of Shein and Amazon,"" says Clark – who is also the mum of Temu shopper Lucy. (Elizabeth was ""appalled"" when she discovered her daughter was getting toys for ""her precious Frenchie"" from the retailer.) Therefore, for smaller brands, Temu's aggressive growth strategies and ultra-low prices are impossible to emulate, she says. Clark has been sounding the alarm bell, and sees her clients struggle when confronted with the ecommerce giant first hand. ""At the start of last year, Temu was kind of nowhere in the US, but by the end, certain companies couldn't even buy products at the price Temu was selling them,"" she says. More like this: Yet for all Temu's power, the company is not impenetrable. Despite being just more than a year old, Temu is already under regulators' lenses for data breaches and exploiting trade loopholes , such as the De Minimis Value threshold in the US, in which orders valued less than $800 (£642) are exempt from duty. There have also been a spate of new probes into the ethics of its business model, and Temu consistently battles serious allegations of slave labour as US lawmakers warn the website may sell forced labour goods . Now, its sheer growth in Europe (at 75 million users in the EU, it surpasses the threshold of 45 million users that makes it a VLOP – very large online platform – according to EU regulations ) means it will likely face more stringent monitoring , even as the sheer number of the site's offerings make consistent review difficult in practice. In the US, efforts to regulate Temu's handling of data has bred calls from lawmakers to investigate or ban the app outright. And although Temu's interface may seem irresistible, Todri thinks that over time, consumers may tire or become wary of the company's relentless gamified approach. ""As consumers become more accustomed to the marketing and business strategies Temu utilises, they might become more sceptical."" But we're not there yet. For Lucy Clark, Temu is still appealing. Despite what she and her mother describe as ""the horrific smell of chemicals"" coming from the dog toys she purcahsed, Rickson loves them. Some have fallen apart – but, says Lucy, in Temu's defence the higher-priced versions would have met a similar fate, anyway. It's why she finds herself continuing to patronise Temu. Simply, she says, the price is right.

In Kampala, Uganda, where Mr Mbokani has lived for 16 years, he first has to buy US dollars. To convert approximately $100 (£80) worth of Ugandan shillings would cost almost $3, he reports. He also adds the withdrawal fee of $7, so that his mother doesn't incur a fee when receiving the money. He sends these remittances through mobile money, usually phone-based digital transfers, rather than through a physical location like a bank, post office, or Western Union-style money transfer company. In real terms 10% of the amount could be eaten up in fees. Mr Mbokani, the chief executive of the Refugee-Led Organization Network (Relon), knows he's far from alone. One target of the UN Sustainable Development Goals is that by 2030, remittance fees should be less than 3%, and total fees to send and receive money between a pair of countries should be no more than 5%. Some researchers believe that to be truly affordable, the first goal should be even less than 3%. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that reaching this target could generate $32bn (£26bn), even apart from the direct-cost savings. This is because remittances have such powerful knock-on effects for the economy, and people tend to send more in remittances when fees are lower. Yet the world is far off this target. According to the World Bank , the global average is 6.2%, over double the target. It's especially pricey to send money to sub-Saharan Africa, where the average transaction fee is 7.4%. For particular combinations of countries, fee percentages can climb well into the double digits. One reason for high fees is inconsistent regulation. Within Africa a payment company can't use a single licence across multiple countries, says Nika Naghavi. She is the group head of growth at Onafriq, a digital payment network that extends through more than 40 African countries. A result is that even between neighbouring countries with a robust trade and frequent population movement, money can't always flow freely. For instance, Ms Naghavi says, transfers between Togo and Benin are frequent and straightforward, helped by having a common currency. Yet money can't easily be sent between Togo and another neighbour country, Ghana. ""That's why the costs become heavy: a lot of it is in compliance and regulation,"" says Ms Naghavi. More technology of business These requirements may not be so applicable to low-value transfers. Sending $50 to a relative in another country is not very risky, but may still fall under a complicated chain of regulations meant to safeguard against money laundering. In some countries, ""the regulations governing who can act as a remittance provider can be quite stifling,"" says Ravenna Sohst, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute Europe. ""For young companies to enter into this market requires a lot of technical, financial and legal knowhow, which I think is one of the reasons why the field has seen relatively few players for a long time."" Ms Sohst says that Mexico-US is an example of a major remittance corridor, where more competition has helped reduce prices. Without competition, rates can be set by the few companies (or informal, cash-based agents) able to facilitate transfers between a pair of countries. Limited competition also means that companies may not feel the need to disclose much information about fees. ""It's up to sometimes the service providers what they want to show to the customer,"" says Uloma Ogba, a gender and learning specialist for the Migration and Remittances Program of the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). This can include misleading claims about zero-fee transactions, which ""often means that the service provider and other agents involved along that transaction process are making money some other way"". ""Our North Star should be to ensure that these customer fees are as close as possible to zero,"" Ms Naghavi says. ""But today it's not possible because of the underlying cost of running your business."" Companies may temporarily lower or eliminate transaction fees during disasters, as occurred immediately after the 2023 earthquake in Morocco. But emergency expenses crop up at other times as well. Female migrants, especially, are sending money home to cover unseen expenses. In Ms Ogba's own monthly remittances from the US to Nigeria, she prioritises her parents' healthcare, her cousin's education, and communal obligations like funeral expenses. On top of this are contributions for home renovations. Flexible pricing structures would be particularly helpful for women. They typically earn lower incomes than men and often send smaller, more frequent remittances for things like healthcare and education, Ms Ogba says. Because digital remittances are more affordable than traditional banking (with average fees of 4.8% vs. 6.2% respectively), and because they can require less documentation, much of the innovation is occurring in the digital realm. For instance, a fintech company catering to Gambian migrants in the UK found that its customers wanted to be able to directly pay utility bills for their families in Gambia. It's impossible to talk about digital innovation in sending money without mentioning cryptocurrency. Some enthusiasts believe that Bitcoin and other types of crypto promise more seamless transfers of money anywhere in the world. However, volatility, patchy regulation and limited knowledge remain barriers to uptake of cryptocurrency for remittances. Even more basic technologies can be out of reach for people sending and receiving remittances. While it's cheaper to send mobile money, many of the poorest people in the world lack mobile phones and internet access. While at least half of remittances are now digital , cash remittances dominate in low-and middle-income countries. It can also be especially difficult for people on the move, or those unable to obtain official forms of identification, to provide tax ID numbers and other documentation. In Uganda, Mr Mbokani says, refugee ID cards aren't part of the same centralised register as national IDs. And there can be obstacles to using refugee IDs at some money transfer agencies. Such issues mean that ""we're leaving a lot of people behind,"" Ms Naghavi comments."

At least 36 UK festivals announced a postponement, cancellation or complete closure in 2024, the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) said. ""Last year was the most expensive year to produce the event that we've ever had,"" said Simon Clarke, the director of Shindig, which will host its final event later this month. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said festivals were ""a vital part of British culture"" and added that the government had recently extended its Supporting Grassroots Music Fund by £5m ""to cover festivals and provide additional support"". But the AIF said the situation is the worst it has ever been and is calling for a VAT reduction on ticket sales. Among the cancellations and postponements are NASS in Somerset, Nibley Festival and Barn on the Farm in Gloucestershire and Inglefest, near Bristol. ""This is actually worse than Covid,"" said John Rostron, CEO of the AIF. ""Prior to the pandemic, independent festivals were growing, flourishing."" But he said it now costs ""double the amount that used to do to put on your festival"". Later this month, Shindig will welcome 10,000 people to Dillington Estate in Ilminster for the last time to see acts including Groove Armada and Brand New Heavies. ""Pre-Covid, definitely, we'd get 50% of our sales early in the year and now it's swung the other way,"" said Mr Clarke. He explained customers buying tickets last minute had left them with a ""cashflow issue"". On top of that, its running costs ""are probably up by about 40% now"", added Mr Clarke. Shindig employs about 1,000 staff and another 1,000 musicians each year. Mr Clarke said it had been ""difficult"" to tell them all that next year would not be happening. ""It's not great news for them or us."" Inglefest, a smaller festival in Wickwar, South Gloucestershire, which has been running since 2013, has postponed this year's event. The organisers are now hoping to raise £10,000 via Kickstarter to secure its future. ""It's like a lifeline to help us to cover those additional costs that we've lost over the last year or two,"" said co-organiser Dom Mosley. He explained if they did not raise the money it would be ""the nail in the coffin"" for the festival. ""It's quite heart-breaking,"" he said. ""It's just not financially viable to keep going in the current climate without some pretty hefty changes."" He added: ""I think the Government should be doing a lot more to support grassroots music in general. ""It's a bit of an epidemic of festivals just dropping at the moment, and it's really sad to see."" Chris Smith, director of WOMAD which is held in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, said: ""There isn't an element of the festival that hasn't been scrutinised and challenged, but it's always cost versus safety, sustainability and the audience experience. ""We have to remember that if we make the wrong decisions and it impacts the quality of the experience for the audience then they may not come back and the financial situation gets worse, being potentially terminal."" Mr Smith said ""wholesale support of the cultural sector"" is needed. ""Every week a new story breaks about a venue closing its doors, artists unable to make a living. ""It has never been about cost, it's about the social economic return for society in the form of an industry that generates billions for the country."" Mr Rostron explained people were still buying tickets to festivals, but events were running at a loss. The AIF wants the government to reduce VAT from 20% to 5% on ticket sales for the next three years. ""It was a lifesaver during the pandemic and right now it's something that we'd need, just for a few years, just on ticket sales. ""But that would give the space that we need for festivals to be able to happen, come through and recover."" ""You wouldn't have the big festivals without the little ones,"" said Mr Mosley. ""It's so important that we don't lose any more of these grassroots events."" The spokesperson for HM Treasury said there were no plans to reduce VAT on ticket sales but explained there were grants available for the grassroots music industry. ""We continue to work closely with the sector to understand the issues facing festivals,"" they added."

Government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £120.7bn in the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said. While this was lower than the previous year, it was £6.6bn more than the government's forecaster had predicted. The government cut National Insurance in March and there has been talk it could trim taxes again in the autumn. However, Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the chancellor was hoping March's figures would provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year, he will have been disappointed."" In addition to the higher borrowing, she noted that government interest payments could be larger than expected given that interest rates are no longer forecast to fall as quickly as previously hoped. This would reduce the headroom for the government to meet its self-imposed spending rules. Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, the think tank focused on lower income households, said that the latest figures suggested there were ""no signs of extra wriggle room"" for any pre-election Budget. The government's independent forecasting body, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had predicted that borrowing over the year would be £114.1bn. A general election has to be held before the end of January 2025, and there has been speculation the government will try to cut taxes again later this year before voters head to the polling stations. Last week, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the Financial Times that he would like to cut taxes in the autumn ""if we can"". The chancellor reduced National Insurance by 2p in the pound in the spring Budget following a 2p cut announced in last year's Autumn Statement. The OBR estimated that each cut will cost the government nearly £10bn. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he still expected the chancellor to cut taxes again before an election. However, he added that the next government would ""face a tricky choice between raising taxes to fix creaking public services or holding the line on the chancellor's recent tax cuts"". ""We suspect whoever the next government is will end up pushing through at least some tax rises to balance the books."" Jessica Barnaby, ONS deputy director for public sector finances, said that over the past year government spending was up by about £58bn ""with increased spending on public services and benefits outstripping large reductions in interest payable and energy support scheme costs"". ""But with public sector income up £66bn, overall, the deficit still fell,"" she said. The ONS also noted that these are the initial estimates of public sector finances for last financial year, and figures will be revised over the coming months. Borrowing in March alone was £11.9bn, which was £4.7bn less than a year earlier but still higher than analysts had expected. Total debt - which is the overall amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years - was £2.7 trillion at the end of March. That is the equivalent of 98.3% of the size of the UK's economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), remaining at levels last seen in the early 1960s, the ONS said. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Debt increased in recent years because we rightly protected millions of jobs during Covid and paid half of people's energy bills after Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent bills skyrocketing."" He added that the government ""must stick to the plan to get debt falling"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney MP said: ""Years of Conservative chaos has left Britain with spiralling taxes and mortgages, all whilst borrowing remains out of control. This is another damning blow for the Conservative government's economic credibility."""

Brits heading to and from Europe will need to register fingerprints and a photo at the border, which has prompted warnings of delays. Eurotunnel chief executive Yann Leriche said journeys would take five-to-seven minutes longer, but extra lanes and technology mean the process will go smoothly. The BBC has had the first look at new machines people will need to use at Folkestone or Calais. At the Port of Dover, Eurostar’s St Pancras terminus and Eurotunnel in Folkestone, French border police check passports as people leave the UK. The EU’s much-delayed Entry Exit system , or EES, will replace manual passport stamping. Citizens of countries which are outside the bloc, including the UK, will need to register their biometric information. There have been repeated warnings of queues as a result, and calls for the EES launch to be pushed back again. There were hopes that an app being developed by the EU could enable some of the registration to be done from home, but it is not expected to be ready for use in October. At Eurotunnel’s Folkestone and Calais sites, we saw how the company which operates vehicle and freight shuttles across the Channel Tunnel has been preparing for the new system. The equivalent of £70m is being spent building processing zones, where people will queue in their cars to use automatic machines. Yann Leriche, the chief executive of Eurotunnel operator Getlink, told the BBC that travellers ""will simply [get] out of their car, spend a few minutes on their kiosks, and go back to their car and continue their journey”. He said it would take “five to seven minutes extra to get through”, but added “as we have extended the number of lanes, there will be no delay on the highway, nothing. It will happen in a very smooth manner”. The company will recruit 140 new staff to assist passengers. I tried out one of the prototype machines which Eurotunnel will use at its terminals. First, it took a scan of my passport. Next, the machine then took a photo of my face. I was then asked to put my right hand on another scanning pad, which recorded my fingerprints. A series of questions about my journey followed on the touchscreen, to which I had to answer ""yes"" or ""no"". At the Port of Dover, the plan is slightly different. Port staff will have iPads for car passengers to register their information. Coaches will be processed off-site at the Western Docks, with e-gates or kiosks. Monday marks 30 years since Queen Elizabeth II and President Mitterand took part in the Channel Tunnel's official opening event. Paying passengers had to wait several months longer to take the journey on Eurostar trains. The tunnel opened £2bn over budget. The company operating it nearly went bust at one point, but it later became profitable and the services through the tunnel have endured. With the pandemic over and preparations under way for the introduction of EES, Getlink boss Mr Leriche wants to see an increasing number of trains going through the tunnel. Eurostar, a separate company to Eurotunnel, runs passenger services from London St Pancras through the Channel Tunnel to Paris and beyond. Since the tunnel opened, it has been the only operator doing that. Now, there's talk of rival operators springing up. Mr Leriche said: ""We are confident that within the next 10 years, there will be a doubling of the direct connection between London and Europe"". "

Pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds have set up tents outside university buildings. Students at Goldsmiths, University of London, have occupied the library. The student protests in the UK come after more than 1,000 people were arrested after pro-Palestinian protests on campuses across the US. While the number of students protesting in the UK is smaller than in the US, the number of universities seeing protests is growing. One camp, at Warwick University, has been set up in the campus's piazza for a week. But others, including at Sheffield and Bristol, started on Wednesday. Protest organisers told BBC News they wanted their universities to divest from Israel in response to its deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip. Divestment means selling off stock in Israeli companies or otherwise dropping financial ties. The prime minister's spokesman said police would ""have our full support"" if students in the UK tried to replicate protests at US universities. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said: ""We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest - but clearly, people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption."" Palestine Solidarity Campaign youth and student campaigns officer Stella Swain said: ""All the protests so far have been completely peaceful. ""There is nothing to indicate that they wouldn't be."" And she hoped no politician, regardless of their views on the issue, would want to see police in the UK respond to protesters in the same way as officers in the US. On Thursday, the Union of Jewish Students said the encampments were creating a ""hostile and toxic atmosphere"" on campuses. ""It is time that universities take their duty of care to Jewish students seriously,"" it added. Student protesters rejected this characterisation of the demonstrations, telling BBC News Jewish students were camping with them. Samira, who asked for her surname to be withheld, said Jewish students were ""very much a part of"" the occupation at her university, Goldsmiths. ""I'm proud that there are Jewish students in the occupation with me and on the marches in central London with me,"" she said, adding the pro-Palestinian movement supported ""peace and justice"". Manchester student Sam, who also asked for his surname to be withheld, said their occupation had been co-organised with Jewish students. Students set up camp in Brunswick Park, near the university's campus, on Wednesday. And Sam said: ""This encampment has been co-organised by Jewish students. ""And there are several Jewish students who are here every day and staying every night,"" he said. UK universities have in general supported the students' right to free speech and to protest. Goldsmiths said: ""We recognise that people hold strong views over the war, and uphold their right to freely express themselves while being clear about the need to be respectful and within the law."" It was ""in dialogue with students over these issues"" and was funding scholarships for Palestinian students. The University of Manchester, meanwhile, said while it ""fully recognises"" the right to protest, ""setting up camp in a city campus raises potential health and safety concerns, risks disruption to staff, students and our wider community, and ultimately is an unauthorised and unlawful use of the university's campus"". ""We will do everything possible to maintain business as usual,"" it added."

The House of Representatives approved the bill on Saturday after months of political gridlock in the chamber. Mr Biden promised ""significant"" support for Kyiv - including more air defences - if senators approve the bill as expected on Tuesday. The assurances come as Russian attacks destroyed a TV tower in Kharkiv. Footage showed the red and white tower collapsing seconds after Russian missiles slammed into it on Monday afternoon in the eastern Ukrainian city, which lies just 19 miles (30km) from the Russian border. Local officials said there were no casualties in the attack, with regional Governor Oleg Syniehubov writing on social media that staff were in a shelter at the time. But Mr Syniehubov said the attack had disrupted television broadcasting in the region. Kharkiv has been targeted in relentless air attacks by Russian forces in recent weeks. In a social media post after the attack, President Zelensky wrote that it was ""Russia's clear intention to make the city uninhabitable"". He added that he had informed President Biden of the strike, which he said happened just before their call on Monday. In a readout of the call released by the White House, President Biden said his administration had a ""lasting commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom against Russian aggression"" . The White House also said Mr Biden had committed to helping Ukraine ""maintain financial stability, build back critical infrastructure following Russian attacks, and support reform as Ukraine moves forward on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration"". The aid package approved by the House on Saturday includes more than $9bn (£7.28bn) of economic assistance in the form of ""forgivable loans"" - ones that do not need to be paid back. Mr Zelensky welcomed Mr Biden's comments, and a top aide to the Ukrainian leader - Mykhailo Podolyak - said the fresh US aid had given the war-weary nation a welcome boost. But Moscow has enjoyed significant momentum in the conflict in recent weeks, notching up a series of victories in the east of the country. And Mr Zelensky has warned that Russia will likely seek a major battlefield success ahead of Victory Day - a state holiday celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany - on 9 May. He suggested that Moscow could seek to seize Chasiv Yar, a small town in Donetsk region, ahead of the holiday. Chasiv Yar lies just west of Bakhmut, the ruined city captured by Russia last year after months of bloody fighting. Military commanders in Kyiv have said Chasiv Yar, which has been virtually emptied of its pre-war population, would open up a path towards the Ukrainian-held cities of Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk if captured by Moscow's forces. Russia's defence ministry also claimed it had seized the town of Novomykhailivka, also in Donetsk region, on Monday. The BBC cannot independently verify the claim, and Ukrainian defence officials said earlier that their forces had held back Russian advances on the village. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, told the BBC's Ukrainian service on Monday that Kyiv's forces faced ""a rather difficult situation"" in the coming weeks. Lt Gen Budanov conceded that the Russian seizure of the town of Avdiivka was ""a real success"" for them. But he said while the battlefield situation may worsen in the coming weeks for Ukraine, it would not be ""catastrophic"". ""Armageddon will not happen,"" he added. President Biden also spoke to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday. In a readout of the call released by her office, Ms von der Leyen said the pair discussed ""their steadfast support for Ukraine as it defends against Russian aggression"" and ""how sustained international support is vital to Ukraine's fight for freedom"". Meanwhile in Moscow, a Russian man has been sentenced to five years  of ""correctional labour"" for providing a comment critical of the invasion of Ukraine to a US publication. Yuri Kokhovets was accused of spreading ""fakes about the army"" for providing a quote critical of the war and of President Vladimir Putin to the US-funded Radio Free Europe in February 2022. It is the first known prosecution of a Russian citizen for expressing an opinion to a foreign journalist."

The sector has seen explosive growth - driving huge profits but also stoking fears about bias, privacy and even the future of humanity . The AI Act works by classifying products according to risk and adjusting scrutiny accordingly. The law's creators said it would make the tech more ""human-centric."" ""The AI act is not the end of the journey but the starting point for new governance built around technology,"" MEP Dragos Tudorache added. It also places the EU at the forefront of global attempts to address the dangers associated with AI. China already has introduced a patchwork of AI laws. In October 2023, US President Joe Biden announced an executive orde r requiring AI developers to share data with the government. But the EU has now gone further. ""The adoption of the AI Act marks the beginning of a new AI era and its importance cannot be overstated,"" said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester. ""The EU AI Act is the world's first and only set of binding requirements to mitigate AI risks,"" she added. She said it would make the EU the ""de facto"" global standard for trustworthy AI, leaving every other region, including the UK, to ""play catch-up."" In November 2023, the UK hosted an AI safety summit but is not planning legislation along the lines of the AI Act. The main idea of the law is to regulate AI based on its capacity to cause harm to society. The higher the risk, the stricter the rules. AI applications that pose a ""clear risk to fundamental rights"" will be banned, for example some of those that involve the processing of biometric data. AI systems considered ""high-risk"", such as those used in critical infrastructure, education, healthcare, law enforcement, border management or elections, will have to comply with strict requirements. Low-risk services, such as spam filters, will face the lightest regulation - the EU expects most services to fall into this category. The Act also creates provisions to tackle risks posed by the systems underpinning generative AI tools and chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. These would require producers of some so-called general-purpose AI systems, that can be harnessed for a range of tasks, to be transparent about the material used to train their models and to comply with EU copyright law. Mr Turodache told reporters ahead of the vote that copyright provisions had been one of the ""heaviest lobbied"" parts of the bill. OpenAI, Stability AI and graphics chip giant Nvidia are among a handful of AI firms facing lawsuits over their use of data to train generative models. Some artists, writers and musicians have argued the process of ""scraping"" huge volumes of data, including potentially their own works, from virtually all corners of the internet violates copyright laws. The Act still has to pass several more steps before it formally becomes law. Lawyer-linguists, whose job is to check and translate laws, will scour its text and the European Council - composed of representatives of EU member states - will also need to endorse it, though that is expected to be a formality. In the meantime, businesses will be working out how to comply with the legislation. Kirsten Rulf - a former advisor to the German government, and now a partner at Boston Consulting Group - says more than 300 firms have been in touch with her company so far. ""They want to know how to scale the tech, and get value from AI,"" she told the BBC. ""Businesses need and want the legal certainty."""

No one was injured, and the bullet was found in a nearby wall. The matter is being investigated, city officials said. Police arrested 112 protesters this week after college leaders sought help clearing the Manhattan campus - a move that fractured the school community . The NYPD held a press conference on Friday to address the issue, following days of criticism for not announcing the incident when it happened three days prior. ""Accidental discharges happen every single year and we average about eight a year and we don't get request [for information] on it,"" NYPD spokesperson Sergeant Tarik Sheppard said. ""If you do ask about it, we'll talk about it like we're doing right now."" The NYPD said in a statement on Thursday night that an unnamed Emergency Service Unit officer was using a firearm's flashlight attachment to illuminate a barricade inside Hamilton Hall, which protesters occupied after being ordered to disperse. An officer fired a single shot into a wall a few feet away. The NYPD said it immediately investigated the incident and determined it was an accidental discharge. No student was near the area when the shot was fired, officials said. The police force did not publicly disclose the gunshot or its internal probe, however, until The City, a local news organisation, reported the matter. The officer's body camera captured the shooting, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office was given the footage for its Police Accountability Unit to review. Columbia University President Minouche Shafik called the NYPD to the campus Tuesday to clear Hamilton Hall, a school building that protesters occupied on Monday night. It was the second time Ms Shafik had police on campus in response to the pro-Palestinian encampment. Students and faculty will have very limited access to the campus for the remainder of the year, just weeks before the semester's end. The university announced that all final exams would be held online. Police released video of prying open doors, climbing through a second story window and clearing chairs and desks from stairwells in Hamilton. While the footage seemed to show that protesters had caused minor damage, it did not show a violent response from them. University students told the BBC earlier this week that the police acted ""rough and aggressive"" toward protesters, though the NYPD has denied this. The police said protesters detained on Tuesday were charged with a variety of offences: burglary, obstructing governmental administration, criminal mischief, resisting arrest, trespassing and disorderly conduct. NYPD data showed that about 29% of those arrested on campus were not affiliated with the university. The protests at Columbia University have helped to spark a greater US student movement to call attention to the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led health ministry says that more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict. The BBC has found that there were nearly 140 campus protests or encampments in response to the war in Israel, which followed Hamas's 7 October attack that killed 1,200 people. The students are demanding that their schools divest from arms manufacturers as well as institutions and businesses affiliated with Israel. They also want schools to publicly disclose their institutional investments. US lawmakers and officials have grown concerned that the demonstrations and encampments have led to a rise of antisemitic incidents and made campuses unsafe for Jewish students. That has led to increased pressure on university leaders to address the protests. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona was scheduled to meet with a group of Jewish leaders on Friday, and he reportedly sent a letter to university officials that condemned ""abhorrent"" acts of antisemitism on campus. ""As the 2023-24 school year comes to a close, I remain incredibly concerned by the reports of anti-Semitic hate directed at students on some campuses,"" he wrote in the letter that was obtained by CNN. Some universities have been able to end the pro-Palestinian protests peacefully. The University of Minnesota and Rutgers University announced on Thursday that they struck agreements with protesters to clear encampments. In exchange, school administrations agreed to consider the students' divestment demands and make their investments publicly accessible. But most protests have not ended as harmoniously, particularly in recent days. Police cleared demonstrators from an encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, on Wednesday arresting about 200 people. At Portland State University in Oregon on Thursday, authorities removed protesters from a library building and detained dozens of students. Early on Friday morning, student organisers said that the NYPD put 50 protesters at New York University and the New School on prison busses, removing them from encampments in downtown Manhattan. US President Joe Biden urged pro-Palestinian protesters on university campuses to uphold the rule of law. ""We are a civil society, and order must prevail,"" Mr Biden said Thursday at the White House, in his first direct remarks about the student demonstrations. Protests also surfaced beyond US borders, in countries including Canada, Australia and France. Police have said they are monitoring a growing encampment at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, after Quebec's premier called for it to be dismantled. Pro-Palestinian protesters camped out at the University of Toronto were allowed to remain, as long as ""activities remain peaceful"", the university said."

Barclays, HSBC and NatWest are all increasing some costs on fixed-rate mortgage deals from Tuesday. Mortgage rates have risen over the past few weeks as views have changed on when the Bank might cut borrowing costs. The Bank is now not expected to cut its benchmark rate as early or as often as previously thought. The announcement from Barclays, which is lifting rates for the second time in the space of seven days, will see a 0.1% increase across a range of its mortgage products. NatWest said it would raise some of its two and five-year ""switcher"" deals for existing customers by 0.1%. HSBC added it was increasing some of its rates on Tuesday, but did not give details of the increases. Building societies are also raising fees. Leeds Building Society said it was increasing the fixed rate on selected products by up to 0.2% for both new and existing customers. The Co-op said it was putting up the rates on some of its fixed deals by up to 0.41% from Monday but cutting the rate by 0.07% on others. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.82%, while the average five-year fixed rate is 5.40%. Broker Justin Moy from EHF Mortgages said a 0.1% increase would not make a big impact on those with small mortgages, but warned homeowners with larger loans - £300,000 or more - would notice a difference. ""With Barclays, they've had two nibbles, 0.2% last Thursday and then 0.1% tomorrow [Tuesday], that's 0.3% overall. For someone borrowing £300,000 that's an increase of £4,500 over five years,"" he told the BBC. The rises would cause ""loads of aggravation"" for borrowers and brokers, Mr Moy said. ""It starts a panic off because customers see rates going up,"" he added. Lenders are lifting rates as they respond to changing predictions about the future direction of the Bank of England's benchmark rate, which dictates borrowing costs and currently stands at 5.25%. The fall in the rate of inflation over the past few months had led many analysts to predict the Bank would begin cutting the rate from June. However, recent data on inflation - which measures the pace at which prices are rising - has shown it is not falling as quickly as expected. The latest inflation figure showed prices rose by 3.2% in the year to March , which was down from 3.4% the month before but still slightly higher than expected. Events in the US have also been affecting markets. US inflation has also not fallen as quickly as predicted, pushing back expectations about when the central bank there, the Federal Reserve, will begin cutting rates. The possibility of a delay to US interest rate cuts has affected markets globally, and is another factor feeding through to higher mortgage costs.

The technology failure, which affected major UK airports including Heathrow and Gatwick, is ""deeply concerning"", Lord Foster of Bath said. A border staff union member called for better contingency planning. The Home Office said ""at no point was border security compromised"". Thousands of passengers faced hours of queues on Tuesday evening after a technology failure. The BBC understands that a ""network routing issue"" was the cause of the outage. The glitch also affected other border security systems, according to the Immigration Services Union. In some locations staff were able to use laptops, and in others the desk systems could access a back-up database, according to Lucy Moreton, a professional officer with the union. Lord Foster, who chairs the Lords Justice and Home Affairs committee, said: ""Technology invariably fails, but the e-gates systems have experienced a number of problems recently,"" he said. The last major e-gate outage was around the late May bank holiday in 2023. Lord Foster called for Border Force staff to be ""equipped and trained to deal with such situations"". He added that ""resilience in our systems is essential"" given the UK is preparing to roll out the new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), a permit which non-British and non-Irish citizens who do not require a visa will generally need to enter the UK. ""The government must get the fundamentals right - and it must be prepared to learn the appropriate lessons when things go wrong,"" Lord Foster said. Ms Moreton said this is third time there have been significant problems with e-gates in three years. Every time this has happened, the union has asked the Home Office ""to ensure there are proper contingency plans in place"", she said. ""We're assured that they are there, but then the next time the gates go down, it's evident that there just simply isn't the infrastructure, or the staff any more, to try and process people through the border while maintaining border security,"" she said. She added that security is ""paramount"" and ""that's what results in the queues"". ""We can't throw the border open and just let people through without checking them,"" she said. The knock-on effects on baggage collection and the rest of people's journeys is ""horrific"", she added. Ms Moreton said the glitch on Tuesday hit the e-gates and ""turned them off"", but also hit the electronic system border staff use. She said border staff get pulled off other duties such as checking for drugs to get people through the border ""as quickly as they can"". Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of independent travel agent industry group The Advantage Travel Partnership, said that there ""needs to be sufficient investment in the technologies used in travel to ensure that these systems run smoothly"". She added that there needed to be ""robust contingency plans in place to avoid any unnecessary disruption to travellers"". The government is currently without a borders watchdog after the previous chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Neal, was sacked after he leaked details of reports that were critical of the UK borders system. Mr Neal said he had decided to leak the reports because the government was not publishing them. His latest report on e-gates, which he sent to the Home Secretary in June 2023, was not published until February 2024. The report provided ""a snapshot of a system nowhere near that envisaged by the UK Border Strategy 2025"", he wrote. The report found that deployment of staff and resources was ""inconsistent"", and that staff suffer from ""a lack of basic communication equipment"". The Home Office was approached for comment, but previously said of the e-gates incident that ""as soon as engineers detected a wider system network issue at 19:44 last night, a large scale contingency response was activated within six minutes"". ""At no point was border security compromised, and there is no indication of malicious cyber activity,"" a spokesperson said."
