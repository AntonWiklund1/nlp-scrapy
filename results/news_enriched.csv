The king did not address his daughter-in-law’s health directly or name her in his brief personal message on Thursday. But royal watchers may interpret his words in the context of the ongoing family health crisis.He also delivered a Bible reading.The king did not appear in person at Thursday’s event — instead Queen Camilla deputized for him. Charles has stepped back from public engagements on medical advice.The king’s public relations team also released a new picture of the monarch sitting at a desk in Buckingham Palace’s 18th Century Room, apparently recording his address into a microphone.Charles has spoken of how touched he is by the outpouring of messages and cards from well-wishers from across the United Kingdom and beyond as he undergoes treatment for cancer, the exact type and stage of which the palace has not disclosed.The king released a statement after Kate revealed her diagnosis last Friday, saying that he had become closer to his daughter-in-law through their shared hospital stays.The king was “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did,” the statement said.The Royal Maundy service is part of the king’s role as the head of the Anglican Church. The monarch hands out specially made coins in white and red purses to 75 men and 75 women to reward them for good deeds such as charity work, a reference to the king’s age. Camilla performed that role on Thursday.The event symbolizes the Last Supper, when Jesus washed the feet of disciples the day before Good Friday. The custom dates back to 600 A.D. and the coins have been in use since 1662, when Charles II distributed Maundy money.Charles attended last year’s service at York Minster, following a tradition set by Queen Elizabeth II to hold it in different places across the U.K., not just in London.The king continues to work behind the scenes while receiving treatment for cancer. On Tuesday, he met community and faith leaders from the Windsor Leadership charity at Buckingham Palace, and he continues to hold a weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, albeit on at least one occasion by phone.",[]

The head of the country’s Federal Security Service (FSB) even suggested Tuesday that it was not just Kyiv but the United States and Britain that were behind the attack, which has now claimed at least 140 lives.Ukraine and its allies have dismissed the accusations, while the U.S. has said ISIS was solely responsible for the attack. Four Tajik nationals charged in the attack appeared severely beaten in a Moscow court Sunday, raising questions about how reliable any testimony they give will be. On Monday, Putin admitted for the first time that the attack had been carried out by “radical Islamists,” while again suggesting that Ukraine was involved.The Russian leader has suggested Ukraine was involved without presenting any evidence.Valery Sharifulin / AFP - Getty ImagesFSB chief Alexander Bortnikov took it further Tuesday and said that “primary data” received from the suspects so far points to a “Ukrainian trace” because “the Islamists alone were unable to prepare such an act.” Bortnikov also accused Kyiv of training militants in the Middle East. His words were echoed by another high-ranking official in Putin’s entourage Tuesday: the secretary of Russia’s National Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev. “Of course, Ukraine,” Patrushev said, answering a question from a journalist about whether ISIS or Kyiv was to blame for the attack.But the Kremlin accusations, while increasingly definitive, have lacked any evidence, details or clarity. “Overall, there’s an odd disconnect. The official line, that Ukrainians recruited jihadists, is being parroted, but often with little conviction,” Mark Galeotti, head of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence and an honorary professor at University College London, wrote on X. “Despite talk of consequences, nothing is really emerging, leaving the authorities looking rather weak.”Russian propaganda has dismissed the ISIS claim of responsibility since the night of the attack, when observers feared that the Kremlin might seek to exploit the situation by blaming its enemies in Ukraine and the West.That has been borne out in the days since. On Wednesday, the pro-Kremlin newspaper Argumenty i Fakty splashed across its front page the faces of President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom against the burning Crocus concert hall in the background, with a tagline that read: “We know the masterminds of the terrorist attack in Crocus. … Let them tell each other the nonsense about ISIS.”When asked why Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, would be in league with Islamist extremists, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested it was not so far-fetched. The Ukrainian leader is a “peculiar” Jewish person who sympathizes with Nazis, Peskov said Tuesday, resorting to the Kremlin’s baseless trope about Zelenskyy and his government. Russia’s Investigative Committee also said Wednesday that it would look into an appeal by several lawmakers to investigate how the U.S. and other Western countries are allegedly organizing, financing and carrying out terror acts against Russia. Pushing that narrative could serve several purposes. It detracts from any meaningful discussion about the failure of Russia’s own security services, which have been busy cracking down on domestic dissent and seemingly missed an attack that was clearly well planned and that the U.S. had warned about weeks in advance.",[]

In a situation like this, any person can say things they don’t mean in a state of intimidation,” Varga wrote. Magyar later denied the claims in a separate post on Facebook.Once a senior but little-known member of Orbán’s political circle, Magyar shot to prominence when he gave an interview in February to popular YouTube channel Partizan, where he accused Orbán’s government of widespread corruption and using smear campaigns to discredit its opponents.Then-Hungarian Minister of Justice Judit Varga speaks at the EU Council headquarter in Brussels in 2023.Thierry Monasse / Getty Images fileOn March 15, he addressed a crowd of tens of thousands in Budapest, where he announced plans to form a new political party to challenge Fidesz’s 14-year grip on power as an alternative to Hungary’s fragmented opposition.The scandal caused an unprecedented political crisis within Orbán’s government, which has led Hungary since 2010. Magyar’s followers hope his position as a former insider can help to disrupt Hungary’s political system, which many see as a deeply entrenched autocracy.The government has dismissed him as an opportunist seeking to forge a new career after his divorce with Varga and his loss of positions in several state companies. But Magyar’s rise has compounded political headaches for Orbán that have included the resignation of members of his government and a painful economic crisis.Magyar has railed against official corruption in Hungary, accusing Orbán of overseeing a nepotistic system of oligarchs that enrich themselves through unfairly awarded government contracts.He has particularly targeted Antal Rogan, a close Orbán ally who is responsible for the government’s communications as well as the country’s secret services. The recording released Tuesday purports to show that Rogan led the effort to alter evidence.Varga served as Hungary’s Justice Minister until February when she resigned amid political scandal after it was revealed that the then-president, Katalin Novák, issued a pardon to a convicted accomplice in a case of child sexual abuse.",[]

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, one of the leaders of a global far-right movement, is a key international ally of his.The visit took place just days after Federal Police seized Bolsonaro’s Brazilian and Italian passports and raided the homes of his top aides as part of a probe into whether they plotted to ignore 2022 election results and stage an uprising to keep the defeated leader in power.Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing regarding this investigation, and multiple others targeting him.Were the Federal Police to obtain an arrest warrant for the former president, officers would not have jurisdiction to enter the Hungarian embassy due to diplomatic conventions restricting access.Bolsonaro’s lawyers said in a statement on Monday that there was nothing amiss about his embassy stay.“In the days he was at the Hungarian embassy, by invitation, the former Brazilian president spoke to countless authorities from the friendly country for updates on the political scenarios of both nations,” his lawyers said in the statement. “Any other interpretations ... constitute an evidently fictional work, with no connection to the reality of the facts.”Speaking at his party’s headquarters in Sao Paulo, Bolsonaro told supporters he gets many calls from Orbán to discuss politics.“To this day I have a relationship with some heads of state around the world,” Bolsonaro said. “If I had my passport, I would have traveled to Israel.”Brazil’s foreign ministry said in a short statement that it had summoned Hungary’s ambassador Miklos Halmai to explain why Bolsonaro was his guest at the embassy.Bolsonaro flew to the U.S. in the final days of his term, in December 2022, just days before his supporters stormed the capital in a failed bid to oust President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from power.

Three of the men had visible bruises and swelling on their faces, including one with heavy bandaging around his right ear. The fourth seemed barely conscious as he sat inside the prisoner’s box dressed in a hospital gown and on a stretcher, with his eyes closed for most of the hearing.It came after images showing the suspects’ violent treatment in custody were shared widely across Russian social media, and as President Vladimir Putin vowed revenge but made no mention of the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the deadly attack.The Basmanny District Court of Moscow named the suspects as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Mukhammadsobir Faizov. Two of the four had admitted their guilt, the court said, although their condition raised questions about whether they were able to speak freely. All four were charged with committing a terror act, according to the court, and could face up to life imprisonment. The suspects were ordered detained until May 22 by the court. Seven more people were detained on suspicion of involvement in the attack.Clockwise from top left: Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni, Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev and Mukhammadsobir Faizov.AP; AFP via Getty ImagesAll four are citizens of ex-Soviet state Tajikistan, Tass state news agency reported. The suspects had to use a translator to communicate in court, according to Tass.NBC News analyzed footage shared over the weekend by Russian pro-war Telegram channels that showed at least one of the suspects being tortured, and others violently interrogated and injured. NBC News was able to authenticate the footage by comparing it with images of the suspects as they appeared in court on Sunday. In one video, suspect Saidakrami Rachabalizoda lies on the ground in the woods while a man hacks at Rachabalizoda’s ear with a knife, before stuffing what looks like part of the ear into Rachabalizoda’s own mouth. Videos also show suspect Shamsidin Fariduni being interrogated on the ground in the woods as a man holds Fariduni’s head up by his hair. In a subsequent image, Fariduni drools on the floor of a sports hall with his pants and underwear around his knees while a man stands on his leg, a black box at his side.The men are accused of perpetrating the worst terror attack Russia has seen in the last 20 years, killing at least 137 people and leaving dozens injured. Videos from inside the Crocus City Hall on Friday night showed several armed and camouflaged men shooting at people inside the venue, seemingly at random. The venue also caught on fire after an alleged explosion, leading the roof to cave in.The detention hearing for the four suspects came as Russia marked a national day of mourning Sunday, and people continued to bring flowers to the burned-out site of the attack.Putin claimed Ukraine’s involvement in preparing an escape route for the suspects before they were captured, an accusation Kyiv has vehemently denied and said was being used to distract from his own security failings and raise support for intensifying his military campaign.",[]

It could even weaken his ironclad rule, particularly after he dismissed American warnings that such an attack might be imminent, some experts say.“It certainly doesn’t strengthen him,” said John Lough, an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a London think tank. “Within the elite itself, there are going to be questions about where the focus has been: Why has there been all this rhetoric about the war in Ukraine, when in actual fact there are other dangers much closer to home?”Russian National Guard servicemen secure an area at the Crocus City Hall after Friday's attack.Alexander Avilov / Moscow News Agency via APMikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian former oil tycoon turned arch Putin critic, called security lapses that allowed the attack to proceed “a complete failure of a police state” in a post on X.It has also not gone unnoticed that Putin waited some 20 hours after the attack to address his country.When he did give a five-minute speech Saturday, Putin did not mention ISIS, whose Afghan affiliate, ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the assault, or refer to the likely failure of intelligence services to prevent the assault or the security services to thwart it.Instead he suggested that Ukraine had aided the attackers by helping plan their failed escape.“They tried to hide and moved toward Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border,” he said.Though not acknowledged by the Russian president, ISIS has long targeted Russia, partly because of Moscow’s role in Syria’s civil war where it supported President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces were fighting rebels that included ISIS, according to Mark Galeotti, head of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence and an honorary professor at University College London.“ISIS-K has long actually regarded Russia as being one of the main enemies,” Galeotti said in a snap edition of his podcast, “In Moscow’s Shadows,” on Sunday. “From their point of view, Russia is a lesser Satan, if America is the great Satan.”On a surprise visit to Syria in 2017, Putin declared “total victory” over ISIS.Keir Giles, a consulting fellow also at Chatham House, dismissed Putin’s attempt to link the attack to Ukraine and his references to a “window” on the front line, saying that it would require Russian forces to let them through on their side of a heavily fortified and mined war zone.“It’s a fairy story,” said Giles, who is the author of 2022’s “Russia’s War on Everybody: And What It Means for You.”Washington agrees. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said that “ISIS bears sole responsibility for this attack. There was no Ukrainian involvement whatsoever.”Russian news reports identified the four alleged gunmen detained as citizens of Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia that is predominantly Muslim and borders Afghanistan. Up to 1.5 million Tajiks have worked in Russia and many have Russian citizenship.On Sunday, four men — Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Mukhammadsobir Faizov — appeared on terrorism charges in the Moscow Court, according to court information.Two had admitted guilt, the court said. All four were ordered held through at least May 22, according to the court.It was not yet clear whether Putin’s oblique comments were merely an attempt to bolster domestic support for his war in Ukraine, or if he seeks to use the terror attack as a pretext for some other action related to the conflict.Giles believes it could be used to support another round of mobilization.Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of reservists in September 2022, which resulted in 300,000 more soldiers being drafted, but military analysts believe another round may be necessary because of the war’s unknown but certainly colossal death toll on both sides.“This gives an excuse for stepping up conscription mobilization, rounding up the manpower that they need,” Giles said, adding that it allows the Kremlin to enact policies “that would not otherwise be popular.”Hours after the Moscow attack, Russia launched a wave of strikes on Ukraine, with one long-range missile briefly entering Polish airspace, the country’s military said. But most experts — including Lough, who is currently in Kyiv — said this was likely not a direct retaliation.“I arrived here on Thursday morning and there was a pretty heavy barrage that night,” he said. “It’s the ongoing effort to try and weaken the will of Ukrainians,” he added. “There’s a lot of psychological warfare here.”",[]

Still, official responses, as well as an edited image posted to the palace’s social media channels, only fueled more unsubstantiated rumors.But many people who had partaken in the online frenzy found themselves expressing regret after the princess broke her silence on Friday. In a video message to the public, the 42-year-old wife of Prince William, Britain’s future king, announced she was diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy.Actor Blake Lively was among the first to make a statement online apologizing for her now-deleted Instagram post, a Photoshop joke inspired by the manipulated Mother’s Day photo released by Kensington Palace.“I’m sure no one cares today but I feel like I have to acknowledge this,” Lively wrote in an Instagram story. “I made a silly post around the ‘photoshop fails’ frenzy, and oh man, that post has me mortified today. I’m sorry.”That sentiment dominated much of the reaction on social media, where users said they wished they hadn’t poked fun at the princess.“Yeah i definitely feel bad about laughing at all the ‘KateGate’ memes. wishing her a speedy recovery,” wrote Saint Hoax, an  influencer who has amassed a following of 3.4 million on Instagram, where they post memes related to current events.The fervor around Kate’s whereabouts — and subsequent online remorse — has underscored a pattern in which the absence of information provides perfect fodder for creators chasing relevance on algorithm-driven social media platforms.“Everybody’s trying to jump in to get a piece of the viral pie, so to speak,” said Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor of digital media technology at the University of Alabama. “When we look at the intersection of conspiracy theories and social media, particularly content creators, everybody wants to have the hottest take, especially when information isn't known.”But Maddox said she hasn’t seen such remorse before in any online conspiracy culture. Usually when internet sleuths are proven wrong, she said, they double down by shifting the goalposts to further deny new evidence and justify their actions.Many online said Kate’s news also serves as a reminder to stop making assumptions about people’s personal lives.It’s a sentiment that’s popped up online before, particularly when celebrities and public figures are overly scrutinized or become the subject of unsupported claims by their followers.Some fans of actor Chadwick Boseman expressed similar regret about commenting on his weight loss when it was revealed after his death that he had been quietly battling colon cancer for years. In April 2023, pop star Ariana Grande spoke out about the public’s “concerns” about her body, saying “you never know what someone is going through.”The Kate news has also highlighted the tension between the public’s desire to know every detail about the royal family and the royals’ desire to keep their health struggles private. The princess’ father-in-law, King Charles III, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. Charles has canceled public engagements while he receives treatment.Reshma Saujani, CEO of nonprofit Girls Who Code, which empowers and equips young girls to pursue careers in STEM, said she felt “disgusted with the internet” when she heard about Kate’s news.“Disgusted with the internet and even disgusted with myself because I fell into the trap,” Saujani wrote in an Instagram post.  “This is a classic example of what we do to women, of how when a woman takes time to prioritize her health and take care of her family, we second guess it to the point of coming up with conspiracy theories to explain her self care.”With Kate’s news now public, Jessica Myrick, a Pennsylvania State University professor who studies the psychology of media use, suggested that the online chatter surrounding Kate may wind down.But, Myrick doesn’t think that social media users will stop creating conspiracy theories online in general, despite expressing some remorse over the Kate news.“There are not a lot of consequences for sharing memes on social media, and if anything, the likes that people got, the laughs, the comments ... that’s probably reinforcing and will probably mean we’ll do it all again,” Myrick said.In her message on Friday, Kate asked people to respect the family’s privacy.“We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment,” she said. “My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.”",[]

On Friday, Russia attacked power facilities throughout Ukraine, triggering outages and killing at least three people.The missile, moving at a speed of almost 500 mph, was in Polish airspace for 39 seconds at 4:23 a.m. (11:23 p.m. ET Saturday), going about a mile into the country, the country’s military said. Even a mistaken Russian missile incursion into the airspace of NATO-member Poland runs the risk of escalating and widening the war next door.On Sunday, Poland’s Foreign Affairs Ministry promised it would “demand explanations from Russia in connection with another violation of the country’s airspace.”“Above all, we call on the Russian Federation to stop terrorist air attacks on the inhabitants and territory of Ukraine,” the ministry said in a statement on X.The last time something like this happened, in December 2023, Poland summoned the Russian charge d’affaires, demanding an explanation.Earlier, Ukrainian news outlets reported on Telegram that during a major attack on Lviv, Russian missiles were flying close to the border with Poland.“Polish and allied aircraft have been activated, which may result in increased noise levels, especially in the south-eastern part of the country,” Poland’s armed forces said on X.Ukrainian servicemen drive to a combat duty in the Kyiv region on Thursday.Genya Savilov / AFP - Getty ImagesRussia has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks during its recent presidential election.“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on X early Sunday. “Russia continues to indiscriminately launch drones and missiles with no regard for millions of civilians, violating international law.”The Ukrainian armed forces said 29 cruise missiles and 28 Iranian “Shahed” drones were involved in the attacks overnight. Of those, Ukraine downed 18 cruise missiles and 25 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.Russian officials did not immediately comment on the events overnight.Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on Telegram there were no attacks on the city, but some 20 missiles and seven attack drones had been launched against the broader Lviv region, targeting “critical infrastructure.”Several blasts were heard in Kyiv after its defense systems repelled strikes, according to Vitali Klitschko, the city’s mayor.Ukraine air defense forces destroyed about a dozen Russia-launched missiles over Kyiv and in the vicinity of the capital, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram.Preliminary information showed no casualties or major damage as a result of the attacks, he said.Separately, the Ukrainian military said it had hit two Russian landing ships during strikes on the annexed Crimean Peninsula.",[]

Her announcement has led to outpourings of sympathy from the public, media and world leaders. For many, this support has been matched by a re-evaluation of the past few weeks, putting the frenzied saga surrounding Kate’s health into a very different light.Shanaz said that she had known about Kate’s surgery, “but the news it was cancer was still shocking.”Kate regularly polls as the most popular royal in Britain, but the uncertainty and what many experts saw as public relations missteps by the palace had fueled intense and at times negative coverage. On Saturday, the picture was very different, with the front page of the popular U.K. tabloid The Sun asserting “KATE, WE ARE WITH YOU.”That sentiment was shared by those outside the palace in central London early Saturday.Vicky Daniels, 49, said she “thought she was really brave to speak out like that, especially as she’s still recovering.”Vicky Daniels outside Buckingham Palace on Saturday.Henry Austin / NBC NewsAsked about the online speculation, Daniels, from Gloucestershire in southwest England, said it was “absolutely horrible.”“I just wish they would leave them alone. I wish they’d leave all the royals to just get on with it. What really gets on my nerves is it’s often people who don’t know what they’re on about anyway,” she said. “It goes without saying that we wish her well, and the kids too.”On Saturday, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said, “The Prince and Princess are both enormously touched by the kind messages” they had received in response to Kate’s video. “They are extremely moved by the public’s warmth and support and are grateful for the understanding of their request for privacy at this time,” the spokesperson said. For the royal family, Kate’s diagnosis adds to a difficult few months. King Charles III, who said Friday he was proud of Kate’s “courage in speaking as she did,” was himself diagnosed with cancer last month and has also been undergoing treatment.“No matter how you look at this news, it is clear that the royal family is in crisis,” said NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew on Friday.“This not only is a crisis for a family, a family of human beings — a grandfather, a son, parents — but this is a crisis for the royal family as an institution.”Back outside Buckingham Palace, after watching a group of riders on horseback make their way past, Sandra Martinez, 50, said she too wanted  to wish Kate well “and we hope her whole family are OK.”",[]

Amid conspiracy theories about the princess’ whereabouts, celebs including Jimmy Kimmel and Jamie Lee Curtis called on people to respect Middleton’s privacy.In a video statement released Friday, Middleton said her cancer diagnosis was discovered following abdominal surgery and she is now in the “early stages” of preventative chemotherapy. “It has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family, but I’ve had a fantastic medical team who have taken great care of me, for which I am so grateful,” Middleton said in the video.",[]

And he has rebuffed calls from other leaders to put the $95 billion Senate-passed aid package on the House floor, saying he is drafting his own Ukraine package.But it means that the lower chamber won’t address funding for Kyiv until mid-April — at the earliest. And Johnson has given few hints as to how he might construct his supplemental aid package, though he maintains it is a priority.“There’s a number of avenues that we’ve been looking at to address that,” Johnson told reporters this week, adding that funding the U.S. government needed to come first. “And having done that now, we’ll turn our attention to it and we won’t delay.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country can’t afford any further delays. He’s told congressional leaders that, without additional aid from the U.S., Ukraine could lose its two-year war against Russia. On Friday, U.S. officials condemned Russia's ""brutal"" overnight attack on Ukrainian cities and civilian targets, described as the ""largest series of air strikes Russia has launched against Ukraine’s energy grid since the start of this war.""For months, the debate over sending Ukraine a fresh round of aid has vexed the divided government in Washington. President Joe Biden, along with the two Senate leaders — Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. — have been exerting pressure on Johnson to quickly take up the Senate bill that includes $60 billion for Ukraine.But five months on the job, Johnson has had to tread carefully on the issue. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee this fall, has lashed out at the Senate package, and far-right Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had threatened to force a vote to oust the speaker, warning that linking Ukraine funding and border security was her ""red line."" On Friday, Greene filed a so-called motion to vacate over her opposition to the government spending package, giving her the option to quickly force the vote next month if she doesn't like Johnson's strategy on Ukraine.Other House conservatives have demanded that Congress secure the southern border before sending any more aid to Ukraine while rejecting a bipartisan deal by senators that included provisions aimed at amping up border security.""If I were calling the shots, I’d say we’re gonna secure the border; we’re not getting another dollar for Ukraine,"" said GOP Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who represents the border state of Texas.A range of optionsU.S. officials estimated that by late March Ukraine’s military could face disastrous supply and ammunition shortages. It was a message reinforced to lawmakers who attended the Munich Security Conference and traveled to Ukraine last month.However, Johnson is keeping his cards close to the vest. He hasn't specified whether the Ukraine aid would be a stand-alone bill — separated from the Israel and Taiwan aid — or if it would be attached to border security provisions demanded by his right flank.The speaker has instructed working groups to use the two-week break to flesh out the plethora of options on a foreign aid package raised by numerous members, an official familiar with Johnson’s thinking told NBC News. There are many ideas on the table; some are more popular in the conference than others.Johnson has said he's open to an idea — first floated by Trump — that would treat nonmilitary aid for Ukraine as a loan to be repaid. Another idea on Johnson’s radar is a bill by Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, the REPO for Ukrainians Act, that would seize assets of Russian oligarchs and use proceeds to pay for the Ukrainian war effort. The Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a version of that bill, but top Democrats are hesitant to move it as a stand-alone measure until the House takes up foreign funding.Other options include additional sanctions on Russia, forcing the Biden administration to reverse course on liquefied natural gas exports and border enforcement provisions.“There are a lot of ideas being talked about” and nothing’s been settled, said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican like Johnson, who controls the floor schedule. “We’re looking at what we can do to address the border security problem first and then helping our friends around the world.”This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin secured another six years in power after he claimed victory in an election with no real opposition. House Democrats, who along with bipartisan Senate leaders have been urging Johnson to put the Senate-passed bill on the floor, bashed GOP leaders for punting the Ukraine issue until after the long recess. Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel and its former chairman, said it’s a dereliction of duty for the GOP-led House to head home for its spring break without aiding its ally.“Ukraine is close to being completely out of ammunition. … They’re making choices now of giving up territory because they don’t have enough ammunition to fight, and then decide to go someplace else to utilize and conserve what they have,” Meeks said in an interview just off the House floor.If Congress funds Ukraine and “we do keep it up, Putin’s aggression will be stopped,” Meeks said. “If we don’t, Putin’s aggression will continue — not only in Ukraine but in other parts of Europe.”Johnson gets an earfulBecause of the desperate situation on the ground and the House's foot-dragging, the White House has had to act unilaterally. The Pentagon rushed $300 million in lethal assistance earlier this month after finding cost savings in contracts. But without more resources from the entity in control of the nation’s checkbook, U.S. military readiness could suffer, top Defense Department officials warned.Johnson has been briefed in secure settings and understands that the situation in Ukraine is important and timely but does not rise to the level of imminent military collapse, a source close to the speaker said. He also accepts that a sizable chunk of the funds appropriated to fund Ukraine’s military would be used to replenish U.S. stockpiles, the source added.Desperate to unlock aid, some top Democrats indicated they would consider the eleventh-hour ideas being raised by House Republicans, but most prefer that the lower chamber put the Senate-passed package on the floor, which they say would pass overwhelmingly.Even those who said the proposals could be worth discussing, including Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California, concluded that it was a “bad idea.” And it’s not even clear that a loan-based approach on nonlethal assistance to Ukraine could be enforceable, in the words of Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who said it was his understanding that it would be a “waivable” loan.“The only viable path forward is for House Republicans to take the national security bipartisan and comprehensive bill that was sent over by the Senate weeks ago and put it on the House floor for an up-or-down vote,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday. “House Republicans need to stop bending the knee to the pro-Putin faction that is growing and ascendant in their party. … The Senate bill is bipartisan, it’s comprehensive and it’s the only viable way forward.”It’s not only Democrats who are giving Johnson an earful about the urgent need for the Senate-passed bill. McConnell on Wednesday reiterated his calls for Johnson to put the package on the floor.“What I’ve said repeatedly is we’re running out of time and the best way to get Ukraine the help they need is for the House to pass the Senate bill. The problem with changing it, as you all know, it can take three days to do the simplest thing here in the Senate. We don’t have the time,” McConnell said during his weekly leadership news conference. “So, I’m continuing to advocate to the speaker that he put the bill on the floor and let people vote,” he said.In the meantime, House Democrats are circulating a discharge petition to force the Senate-passed bill to the floor, bypassing Johnson and GOP leaders. The petition requires 218 signatures, which would need to include a handful of Republicans to trigger a vote; Democrats have just 188 signatures. Separately, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Jared Golden, D-Maine, are collecting signatures for their own bipartisan discharge petition that would fund Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan while incorporating some border enforcement provisions. It has just 16 supporters so far. On Thursday, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., signed onto both discharge petitions, one of his final acts before resigning from Congress on Friday.

What does that mean?,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/princess-kate-middleton-preventative-cancer-treatment-what-know-rcna144695,2024-03-22T20:42:08.214Z,"Kate, the Princess of Wales, said Friday that she is in the early stages of “preventative chemotherapy” for cancer that was found following abdominal surgery in January. In a taped video statement, the future queen of England said that at the time of her surgery, doctors did not believe her condition was cancerous. Tests done afterward, however, found that “cancer had been present,” she said. “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment,” Kate said in the video. A Kensington Palace representative said the chemotherapy began in late February. Kate did not say what type of cancer doctors found, or how advanced it was. But cancer doctors say that in general, preventive or, more specifically, “adjuvant” chemotherapy is quite common following surgery that finds cancer.“It’s almost like an insurance policy,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “The person has had surgery to remove all the cancer that is visible, and then we give chemotherapy to try to eliminate or get rid of any remaining cells that might be in the body but are too small to be seen.” “The surgery was successful, and that’s the most important thing,” said Dr. Eleonora Teplinsky, head of breast and gynecologic medical oncology at Valley Health System in New Jersey. The objective of adjuvant chemotherapy is to “reduce the chance for the cancer to come back in the future.”None of the physicians interviewed for this story has been involved in Kate’s medical care. The type of adjuvant chemotherapy and the length of treatment depends on the type of cancer that’s been diagnosed. It’s given within a specific window of time proven to increase the chances that the cancer will never progress or return, said Dr. Ben Ho Park, who leads the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville, Tennessee.“You get one shot on goal when you have cancer that’s been surgically removed,” he said.Chemotherapy can lead to a host of possible side effects, including extreme fatigue, poor appetite and nausea. Hair loss can occur, but not always. It also has the potential to lower a person’s ability to fight off viruses and other illnesses. “Depending on which drug she’s getting, there may be more individual side effects that we assess for and monitor,” Teplinsky said.At age 42, Kate is relatively young and, by all public accounts, otherwise healthy. “Someone who is 42 has more decades of life ahead of them than someone who’s 82. That somewhat colors our thinking in terms of, ‘Hey, should we be as aggressive as possible to make sure that this cancer will never come back?’” Park said. Cancer experts worldwide have noted rising cases in younger adults. “In general, we’re seeing more and more people who are younger who are getting cancer. In my area of expertise, colorectal cancer, we know colon cancer is definitely on the rise. The screening age has turned to 45 because of that,” said Dr. Aparna Parikh, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “But beyond just colon cancer, other cancers are also rising in younger people.” While it is unknown what type of cancer Kate’s doctors found, “it’s important to raise awareness for young adults that this can affect anyone,” Cercek said.",[]

It was thought that her condition was noncancerous and that the surgery had been successful, Kate said Friday in a rare video message. ""However,"" she said, ""tests after the operation found cancer had been present.”Kate said that she was now undergoing “a course of preventative chemotherapy” on the advice of her medical team. She did not specify what type of cancer she has or at what stage it was found, and Kensington Palace, the couple’s royal household, has not said why the operation was necessary.""I am now in the early stages of that treatment,"" Kate said in the statement, released by the palace. She thanked the public for their support but also asked for ""time, space and privacy"" while completing her treatment.Follow live updates on Princess Kate's health announcement""This, of course, came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment,"" Kate said. ""But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be OK,"" she added, referring to their three young children.Kate also had a message for those affected by the disease.""At this time, I am also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer,"" she said. ""For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone."" At the time of Kate's operation, William postponed a number of engagements as he juggled being with his wife and looking after their children. King Charles III was himself diagnosed with cancer last month and has been undergoing treatment. Buckingham Palace has not specified the type of cancer or at what stage it was found, though the announcement marked a break with royal history that has often seen ailments hidden from the public.Kate's surgery and withdrawal from the public eye led to commentary and conspiracy theories that spread across social media. On Friday, Kate asked for privacy.""I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits. Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too. As is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both,"" she said.""We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment,"" she said. ""My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.""The White House issued a message of support shortly after the news was announced.“Our thoughts are with the Duchess of Cambridge and her family members and friends during this incredibly difficult time,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his ""thoughts are with the Princess of Wales, Prince of Wales, the Royal Family and in particular her three children at this difficult time,"" he wrote in a post on X. ""I know I speak for the whole country in wishing her a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing her back in action when she’s ready,"" he added.King Charles said he was “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did,” according to a statement issued by Buckingham Palace.The king had “remained in the closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law throughout the past weeks,” following their time in hospital together, a palace spokesperson said.Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, offered their support for Princess Kate in a statement Friday. ""We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,"" the pair said.Kate's absence from public view and the ensuing media frenzy have  fueled a public reckoning with how the royal family balances its desire for privacy with transparency and accountability in the modern world.The royal rumor mill was sent into overdrive when a family photo of Kate and her children — released to mark Mother's Day in the United Kingdom and in an apparent bid to end the rumors — was pulled by photo agencies because it had been digitally altered.As uproar grew, Kensington Palace said that Kate herself had edited the photo and apologized ""for any confusion.""She was seen in grainy video a week later, after being spotted out shopping with William in Windsor, in what royal experts said was likely a deliberate effort to put an end to the saga. But it then emerged that Britain's data watchdog was investigating a report that staff members at the hospital where she underwent surgery had tried to access her medical records.Kate regularly polls as one of the most popular members of the royal family. The former Kate Middleton grew up in Berkshire, an affluent county west of London. She was raised by entrepreneur parents and attended the exclusive Marlborough College.

And everyone should understand this for their own internal mobilization,” Peskov added.The comments quickly drew attention in Russia and abroad, where observers of the war are watching for signs that the Kremlin is readying its public for deeper and prolonged involvement in Ukraine, including a second wave of mobilization to beef up its military ranks as the conflict enters a third year.The Kremlin has insisted on calling its full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine a “special military operation,” and censorship laws adopted in the early days of the war have allowed authorities to arrest or even jail people who criticize Russia’s actions in Ukraine or simply use the word “war.”Peskov’s comments would appear to be a departure from that language, which sought to cast the invasion as a limited endeavor and play down its increasingly dominant role in Russian life.As the remarks drew headlines across the world, analysts were divided over whether they signaled a dramatic shift from the Kremlin.Peskov’s point that everyone in Russia should understand that the country is in a state of war “for their own internal mobilization” was noted as a particular sign that authorities may soon be asking for more from the Russian public. A new recruitment drive has long been seen as a possibility once Putin secured re-election.“Now it’s official: the SMO (special military operation) is recognized as a war. Of course, the SMO de facto became a war a long time ago,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the founder and head of the political analysis firm R.Politik.“But this is a certain psychological boundary, beyond which both the population and the elites will be faced with different demands than during the period of the special military operation,” she wrote on Telegram.Russia's military has been pushing forward on the battlefield after seizing the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka.Stanislav Krasilnikov / Sputnik via APHowever, others noted that Kremlin officials regularly allude to a wider “war” in their remarks.“This is not new: The idea that the SMO is just one front, albeit the most bloody, in a wider political-economic-cultural war with the West has long been established, not least by Putin in his state of the federation speech last month, in which he used the w-word,” said Mark Galeotti, head of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence and an honorary professor at University College London.Peskov’s mention of “internal mobilization” is actually key, Galeotti said. “The Kremlin’s demand that every Russian get into a wartime mindset, and realise there is now no middle ground between being a patriot and a traitor (as Putin defines these),” he wrote on X. “But it’s also important to stop sometimes and not think that there’s going to be a ‘gotcha’ moment when Putin’s mask is ripped off.”Peskov sought to clarify his comments later Friday.“This is not related to any legal changes,” Peskov said in his daily briefing with reporters, when asked if they signified a legal change in the status of the “special military operation.”“This is a special military operation de jure. But de facto, in fact, it has turned into a war for us after the collective West has been directly increasing the level of its involvement in the conflict more and more.”When pushed on the fact that some in Russia have been put in jail for protesting with the phrase “no to war,” Peskov said it was a “completely inappropriate comparison” because “the context is different.”Last December, Peskov told NBC News that Russia’s fight remains a “special military operation,” but said the West’s efforts against Russia were indisputably a war, citing what he called “direct” involvement of foreign countries in the conflict and U.S.-led economic sanctions. “If it’s not a war, then how would you like to call it?” Peskov said at the time. “We call it war.”Putin has framed the war in Ukraine as Russia’s existential fight for survival against the West, which he said seeks its annihilation.Russian propaganda frequently berates Western governments for supplying Ukraine with weapons, accusing them of effectively fighting Russia on the battlefield, if only by remote control so far.Tensions around the West’s involvement in Ukraine have grown in recent weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that he couldn’t rule out sending Western troops on the ground in Ukraine in the future. Putin responded by saying that could precipitate a nuclear war.",[]

The brow furrows. The bicep bulges.In moody black and white, photos of French President Emmanuel Macron pounding a punching bag arched eyebrows across Europe on Thursday after his official photographer posted them to social media in what was widely received as the latest round in his drive to toughen up the region’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.But reviews were mixed along political lines. Some in France said Macron, who is 46, looked like a “warrior” and likened him to movie heroes like Rocky Balboa and Robert DeNiro’s character in “Raging Bull.”Across the English Channel, reviews of “macho Macron” were less flattering. “Macron: Le grand narcissist,” groused the Daily Mail. And Daniel Johnson in the Telegraph called him “a prancing poseur”: “Past presidents like Resistance hero General de Gaulle felt no need to show off.”Macron’s office said it would not comment on the photos. But the images were interpreted by many on social media as reflecting his pressure on other Western countries to more strongly defend Ukraine as the war enters its third year. Last month, he said the possibility of Western troops being sent to Ukraine could not be ruled out, a comment that prompted an outcry from other leaders.Political history is filled with leaders using visuals to display toughness, virility and strength.Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, famously posed shirtless on a horse and was recorded apparently showing off his judo skills. The United States had cowboys Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, ranch owners in California and Texas respectively, who were widely photographed wearing cowboy hats and boots and sometimes riding horses.Public flexing doesn’t always go as planned. The same week British prime minister Boris Johnson lost control of Parliament in 2019, he struggled to lead a live bull on camera during an event in Scotland. The animal ended up knocking into a police officer. Another time during a game of street rugby with children in Japan, Johnson knocked down a 10-year-old.Macron, for his part, was one half of a handshake showdown with former President Donald Trump in Brussels in 2017. In front of photographers, the two locked eyes, gripped hands — and didn’t let go even as their knuckles turned white. The handshake-averse Trump at one point seemed ready to pull away. But Macron wasn’t. He held on a few seconds more. The men’s jaws seemed to clench.“My handshake with him, it wasn’t innocent,” Macron later told Le Journal du Dimanche. It was “a moment of truth,” he said, adding: “One must show that you won’t make small concessions, even symbolic ones, but also not overpublicize things, either.”Macron is well aware of the power of visual content to convey messages. He is also the first French president to extensively use social media.His official photographer, Soizig de la Moissonnière, documents his public and private daily life through photos posted on her Instagram account, with about 216,000 followers, including the ones of Macron boxing, muscles bulging through a black shirt. Macron once said he was personally approving the photos to be posted there.Valerie Doustaly, a Paris-based image consultant, said Thursday’s photos appeared aimed at communicating a feeling about Macron’s “lifestyle and personal life, which is increasingly important for any profession, even for the role of a president.”“There is a clear strategy to show the health, youth and strength of someone who chooses boxing as a sport,” Doustaly said. “President Macron takes care of his image with perseverance, he always takes care of his look, his evolving hairstyle, and now surprises us with a T-shirt that shows his flexed biceps.”Since Macron was elected in 2017, he has seized many occasions to show his athletic skills. He has held multiple events meant to promote the Paris Olympics and last year described sports as conveying “values of respect, effort, equality, healthy living, surpassing oneself.” Last month, Macron promised to swim in the River Seine, which is being cleaned up for the Paris Olympics laster this year.In January, he launched the 200-day countdown for the Olympics with a video posted on his social media, appearing in a sport T-shirt next to a punching bag with boxing gloves on his shoulder and sweat on his face.Brigitte Macron said in a November interview with Paris Match that the French president does boxing training twice a week. It’s a sport he is said to practice with some of the officers in charge of his security. Macron was also seen boxing during a campaign event in the northern suburbs of Paris in April 2022, just before being reelected for a second term.",[]

There’s no lack of production, but we are not able to get any fair price for it.”Tractors have been rolling down highways not just in India but across Europe — where issues including the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine, climate change and efforts to fight it as well as rising competition have driven angry farmers to the streets of Paris, Brussels and beyond.Tractors block roads around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on March 1.Remon Haazen / Getty ImagesWhile the specific factors fueling the anger vary from country to country, the result is largely the same: Farmers say governments need to take drastic action if their way of life is to survive. And the timing is no coincidence, experts say, with protesters seeking favorable policies in a year with a record number of elections around the globe.“Most farmers are not making a profit. Most of them are scraping by and doing backbreaking work most city people don’t understand,” said Chris Hegadorn, a former U.S. diplomat and an adjunct professor of food politics at Sciences Po in Paris. “Election cycles allow them to press their case publicly,” Hegadorn said.Singh and thousands of farmers in northern India began marching to the capital earlier this year demanding higher prices for their crops, among other debt relief measures. They were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, internet blackouts and police batons and blocked from the capital for weeks until last Thursday, when they were allowed to rally there.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are seeking to avoid a clash with the farmers ahead of elections later this year.“I think Modi and the BJP government are frightened by the power of farmers,” said Garrett Graddy-Lovelace, an associate professor at American University in Washington, D.C. “They are a formidable political force,” she added.Farmers say they are not asking for subsidies but a fair price that would see them receive a 50% profit over their cost of production.“The urgency of staying on the land depends upon a fair price,” Graddy-Lovelace said, “so they can stay on their land and keep nourishing the people.”Almost two-thirds of India’s 1.4 billion population are farmers. For decades they relied on a minimum support price for their crops, which is a rate at which the government guarantees to buy surplus stock at the end of the harvest. State governments have historically bought only rice and wheat at the fixed level. But in 2020, the government opened up the markets to corporate buyers, who work directly with the farmers.“It looked good on paper,” Graddy-Lovelace said. But “the farmers knew that if they were dealing directly with the buyer, the buyers would drive the price down to nothing.”Months of protests and deadly clashes with authorities in New Delhi ultimately forced the government to repeal the new farm laws, in what was seen as one of Modi’s biggest political defeats since he took office in 2014. It was an “extraordinary victory,” Graddy-Lovelace said, “not just for India, but actually pushes back against a whole kind of global paradigm that free trade works for farmers.”But the farmers say that the government has not kept promises made in the wake of that clash, leading Singh and others to travel far from home in a bid to secure reforms. ‘Farmers’ concerns are real’It’s not just India where farmers are struggling. Across the European Union, farmers say they are battling soaring costs of living and production, rising taxes and the burden of new environmental rules, which they say renders them uncompetitive against cheaper imports from abroad.Hegadorn said that in recent years governments have made a “huge number of political commitments ... to reduce greenhouse gases.""Over the last few months, protests have united farmers across the Continent. In France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Italy and Greece, farmers have blared horns and in some cases dumped manure at government buildings in a bid to put their plea for reforms at the forefront of the E.U. parliamentary elections to be held in June.A tractor blocks a road during a protest in Madrid on Sunday.Gabriel Luengas / Europa Press via Getty ImagesOne major issue, they say, is burdensome red tape related to the mass of regulations that come as a condition for the subsidies that farmers across Europe depend on. “It’s very bureaucratic. You need to pay an accountant and a lawyer to advise you,” said Arnold Puech, president of the World Farmers Organization and a poultry and beef farmer in northern France’s Normandy region. Even the slightest error in paperwork or during farm inspections can attract a large fine, he said. “It’s my wife who spends all her time in front of the computer to do these administrative tasks,” he said.Protesters are also calling for a withdrawal from the E.U.’s Green Deal to fight climate change, which they say is too costly. In Germany and France, Europe’s biggest agricultural producers, farmers are furious over the rise in diesel costs brought by the end of subsidies and tax breaks. The protests have led politicians across the Continent to vow to ease the burden on farmers and water down some regulations. But the farmers’ drive to shift Europe’s approach has drawn pushback, too.Environmentalists say stringent measures are necessary to fight climate change, especially since Europe’s agricultural sector accounts for a large portion of the Continent's greenhouse gas emissions, despite accounting for only 1.4% of E.U. GDP in 2022, according to the European Commission.“Farmers’ concerns are real,” said Julia Bognar, land use and climate program head at the Institute for European Environmental Policy. “However, there needs to be a long-term vision for the agricultural sector to transition toward more climate-friendly practices,” she said.The bargaining power farmers used to have has weakened, Bognar said, pushing them to use measures that ultimately have “negative environmental impacts.” “Funding must be sufficient and stable to provide positive incentives toward mitigation actions,” she added.There are fears that the farmers’ protests are being seized on by far-right parties — which are expected to surge in those Europe-wide elections this summer — and by the Kremlin, too.Ukraine, often referred to as Europe’s breadbasket, has long been dependent on its own agricultural sector. As part of its efforts to support Kyiv amid Russia’s war, the E.U. has exempted the country from import duties, which has led to agricultural products not bound by the E.U.’s costly environmental standards flooding the Continent. That has infuriated farmers, who are now competing not only with local rivals but also with Ukrainian imports that are simply cheaper than what they can produce.Polish farmers demonstrate against E.U. climate measures and Ukrainian imports in Warsaw on March 6.Wojtek Radwanski / AFP - Getty ImagesThousands of farmers and supporters marched in Warsaw this month, demanding that the Polish border with Ukraine be closed to cut off the imports. They blew horns, burned smoke bombs in the white-and-red colors of the national flag and threw stones at police, injuring several officers in front of parliament. The Polish government blamed unspecified “provocateurs and troublemakers” for the violence, as opposed to “real farmers” whose complaints it has pledged to address.Some protests in Poland have featured banners in favor of Russian President Vladimir Putin and against Ukraine, raising fears in Warsaw and beyond that Moscow is seeking to leverage long-standing issues to fuel opposition to European support for Ukraine.The protests have raised tensions between the governments in Kyiv and Warsaw, which has been a close backer of Ukraine.The E.U. reached a deal on Wednesday for new limits on imports of Ukrainian farm products.But it seems clear that the underlying issues are not going away any time soon, and that governments from Europe to India will have to find answers to those blaring horns.",[]

She was previously convicted in a scam in Los Angeles that was detailed on the ""Queen of Con"" podcast.Marianne Smyth, 54, is accused of defrauding five customers by enticing them to invest with her while she worked as a mortgage advisor in Northern Ireland from March 2008 to October 2010, British and U.S. officials said.She is accused of scamming five people out of £135,570 (US$172,000), money that she said would be invested but instead kept for herself, the officials said.An arrest warrant in Maine was signed and issued Feb. 23 for her arrest and extradition to Northern Ireland, where she is charged with four counts of fraud by abuse of position and four counts of theft.An extradition hearing is set for April 17 in Bangor. An attorney listed for Smyth did not reply to a request for comment. Smyth could face up to 10 years in prison for each of the charges, prosecutors have said in court, according to The Guardian. Marianne Smyth.Police Service of Northern IrelandAlleged Northern Ireland schemesSmyth is accused of defrauding the five people while working as an independent mortgage adviser for An Independent Mortgage Solution Ltd.In that role, she was supposed to ""safeguard the financial interests of her clients,"" a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Maine said. Instead, she stole her clients' money, U.S. prosecutors said on behalf of British officials seeking her extradition.Police in Northern Ireland received reports about Smyth's fraud and theft in July 2009. But by then, she had left the U.K. and returned to the U.S., prosecutors said.One victim, identified in court documents as J.S., told police he met Smyth in 2009 when she arranged a mortgage on his home. He said Smyth offered him the opportunity “to invest in a high interest-bearing account held with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,” the complaint said. On June 15, 2009, J.S. and his wife met with Smyth and gave her a check for £20,000 to be invested, the complaint said. But the couple never saw or heard from her again, it said. Officials said a police investigation determined that the check was deposited into Smyth’s bank account the day after it was issued and that there was no evidence that the funds were ever invested or returned to the couple. That account was closed Oct. 4, 2010, according to court documents. Police said they received similar accounts from other alleged victims.One person, identified in court documents as S.S., told police he was offered the opportunity to invest in a high interest-bearing account with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia with a return of £400 a month if he invested £20,000. He gave Smyth a check on Oct. 28, 2008, according to officials.From November 2008 until April 2009, and again in June 2009, S.S. received £400 a month, which he believed to be the return on his investment, the court documents said. But after June 2009, the payments stopped, officials said. Prosecutors say that when he contacted the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a representative informed him the bank “had no record of an account associated with his name and that the account number did not exist.” S.S.'s attempts to contact Smyth were unsuccessful, according to court documents.Smyth last arrived in the U.S. on June 25, 2013, on a U.S. passport and hasn’t left the country since, the complaint said. The British Embassy requested her extradition in 2021 and again in October. Surveillance was conducted by the U.S. Marshals Service; Smyth was located in Bingham, Maine, in January; and the complaint and warrant were signed and sealed on Feb. 23. Guilty of fraud in CaliforniaYears after she disappeared from Northern Ireland in 2009, Smyth was convicted in Los Angeles of defrauding podcaster Johnathan Walton, who has said that at one time he considered her his best friend.Smyth was convicted in January 2019 of grand theft in California and sentenced to five years.In an essay for HuffPost in 2019, Walton detailed ""a four-year nightmare"" involving Smyth, who he called ""an immensely lovable woman who inserted herself into my life and became my best friend.""""Unfortunately, she was also an international con artist on the run from the authorities and I was about to become one of her many 'marks,'"" Walton wrote. Walton wrote that Smyth conned him out of nearly $100,000, forcing him into bankruptcy, while ""she was also scamming dozens of others around the world by impersonating psychics, mortgage brokers, psychologists, lawyers, travel agents, and even pretending to be a cancer victim.""Before Smyth was convicted, Walton started a blog about his situation with Smyth after he filed a police report in 2017. He said in the essay that others began coming forward with allegations against Smyth. As the story gained traction, he wrote, police in Northern Ireland reached out and said they had been searching for Smyth for years in connection with a number of other alleged scams. In 2018, Los Angeles police arrested Smyth. During her grand theft trial in Los Angeles, Walton said four other people testified to show a pattern of her behavior. Smyth was found guilty of scamming Walton out of $91,784 in January 2019 and sentenced to five years.She was released from prison early on Dec. 12, 2020, at a time when California was freeing thousands of nonviolent prisoners to curb the spread of Covid. Walton then turned his story into a podcast series, ""Queen of the Con,"" in early 2021. As a result, The Guardian reported, listeners contacted Walton with Smyth's most recent address in Maine. He said he then shared the address with Northern Irish authorities, according to The Guardian, which led to Smyth's arrest in Bingham.",[]

""I have nothing in mind,"" he added. ""I have no definite personal or political plans.”  A senior Irish official told NBC News that the announcement would be “a bolt from the blue for the Irish public,” which “throws everything up in the air.” The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, added that Varadkar, who trained as a physician, “didn’t see a lifetime in politics.”Varadkar’s departure, which comes less than a week after he met with President Joe Biden at the White House before St. Patrick's Day, will not automatically trigger an election.Varadkar said he had asked for a new leader of the party to be chosen on April 6, allowing a new prime minister to take office after parliament’s Easter break.Varadkar, 45, whose mother is Irish and father is Indian, was the country’s youngest leader when first elected, as well as Ireland’s first gay and first biracial prime minister He served two terms as taoiseach, from 2017 to 2020 and again since December 2022.During his time in office he oversaw referendums to change the Irish constitution legalizing same-sex marriage and abortion.But this month he suffered humiliating defeats in two elections, when his countrymen overwhelmingly voted against proposed changes to the constitution that would have redefined marriage and removed “sexist” language.Varadkar told reporters he knew his resignation would ""come as a surprise to many people and a disappointment to some, but I hope you will understand my decision."" “Politicians are human beings, and we have our limitations,” he said.",[]

Putin discussed the cross-border incursions during a meeting Tuesday with top officials of the Federal Security Service, the FSB.Civilian areas of Belgorod have been battered in the fighting. According to Gladkov, 16 people died and 98 were injured over the last week alone. On Saturday, he ordered the closure of shopping malls through Monday and schools through Tuesday because of the security situation.The planned evacuation of children is one of the biggest publicly announced in the Belgorod region since the war began in February 2022. About 1,000 people, including children and their families, were evacuated to other Russian regions last June, and there have been other sporadic reports of evacuations over the past year.It was unclear whether adults would be accompanying the children under the latest evacuation order. If so, the total number of evacuees could be much higher.Roughly 600 people were in temporary accommodation Monday after being evacuated from their homes, Gladkov said.A heavily damaged vehicle in the aftermath of fresh aerial attacks in the settlement of Razumnoye outside Belgorod on March 19, 2024. AFP - Getty ImagesThree people were wounded Tuesday in an aerial attack from Ukraine on the Belgorod region, Gladkov said, including a 14-year-old who had part of a limb amputated. His mother was also seriously hurt in the attack, he said.The previous day, four members of the same family died in an attack on the Belgorod village of Nikolskoe, according to Gladkov. A grandmother, mother, her partner and 17-year-old son were killed after a missile struck their house, he said.It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s battlefield claims.Ukraine doesn’t usually comment directly about strikes on Russian soil. But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Tuesday that any military action there was “the direct consequence of the illegal and unprovoked aggression of Russia against Ukraine” when the Kremlin’s forces launched their full-scale invasion.Two Ukrainian drones were shot down over Belgorod and another over the neighboring Voronezh region overnight, the Russian defense ministry said. It gave no details of any damage or injuries.Meanwhile, Russia used S-300 missiles to attack the city of Selydove in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine overnight. Four people were wounded and houses and cars were damaged, the regional prosecutor’s office said.On Monday, Russian attacks in the Donetsk region killed one person and wounded another, according to Vadym Filashkin, the regional governor.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukraine’s Western partners on Tuesday to quickly supply more air defense systems and illustrated the scale of the challenge Kyiv’s forces face. He said so far this month, Russia has used 130 missiles of various types, more than 320 Shahed drones and nearly 900 guided air bombs to target various regions of Ukraine.Ukraine has ramped up its defense production and plans to reach levels unseen since the country gained independence during the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, according to Zelenskyy. But it still relies heavily on Western support, which has waned in recent months.Kuleba, the foreign minister, said European countries are expanding their military output and purchases to provide more help while additional U.S. support is stuck in Congress.“It helps us to fill the gap that has been created by the delay in the U.S. decisions,” he said of the European push. “It doesn’t solve the problem entirely but it helps to sustain the pressure” on Russia.Meanwhile Tuesday, Adm. Alexander Moiseyev was presented as the new acting head of the Russian navy during a ceremony at a naval base in Kronstadt, in the Gulf of Finland. Russian media reported last week that the previous navy chief, Adm. Nikolai Yevmenov, had been fired and replaced with Moiseyev, the commander of the navy’s northern fleet.Yevmenov’s replacement followed a series of successful attacks by Ukrainian drones and missiles on the Russian Black Sea fleet that have forced Moscow to limit its naval operations in the region.",[]

Not so in the age of internet-fueled conspiracy theories and nosediving trust in public institutions: a time when anything is forgeable and therefore everything, especially anything put out by Britain’s royal family these past few weeks, remains open to questions.The video, published by the British tabloid The Sun, shows a man in a baseball cap and a jacket, accompanied by a woman with brown hair wearing a hooded sweater and sports leggings. The newspaper said it was recorded at Windsor Farm Shop, near the couple’s home to the west of London, and it splashed the story on its front page alongside the headline, “Great to see you again, Kate!""Britain’s most-read paper, The Daily Mail, summarized the generally sympathetic tone of the country’s news media, calling it the “image the world has been waiting to see.”The story hit The Sun's front page Tuesday.Kirsty Wigglesworth / APThe gossip website TMZ, which also published the video, said it had “delved into the metadata” and had “no doubt” that it was a “legitimate video.”Kensington Palace did not immediately respond to a request for a response to the video. But it would have known that someone at this very public place would most likely spot them, NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew said Tuesday on “TODAY.”“This was a genuine member of the public who happened to see Kate and William at this farm shop,” McAndrew said. “But was it setup, in that they knew perfectly well that somebody would take a photograph of them? Yes, I think we can assume that was the case.” McAndrew said she thought there was a strong chance Kate will make her official return to the public eye on Easter Sunday.In the meantime, the video has not been enough to convince some of the frenzied masses on social media who have become enthralled by the saga and whose engagement with the royal rumor mill had reached fever pitch just as the video emerged.Whether the palace or the rest of the public agrees, it is still a topic of intense conversation, with related search terms among the trending topics on multiple platforms.“That ain’t Kate….,” said TV producer Andy Cohen, who has 2.2 million followers on X.At the center of all this is a woman who, according to the palace, is recovering from major abdominal surgery and has always been expected to be out of action until at least the end of this month.“Once we do have answers about what has gone on with the Princess of Wales these past few months, people are going to feel sincerely guilty about their behavior,” Kinsey Schofield, host of the “To Di For Daily” royal podcast, told Britain’s Times Radio on Tuesday.Polling for Sky News, NBC News’ British partner, suggested that more than half of the population had seen the conspiracy theories but that trust in the royals had not been significantly dented.At the same time, even many sober royal experts say there have been a slew of decisions by the palace that at best do not help the royal cause with the public, providing fodder for observers seeking to uncover some grand conspiracy.The picture agency Getty, one of those that pulled Kate’s family photo last week, added an editor’s note Tuesday to another royal image taken by the princess, saying her photo of the late Queen Elizabeth II with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren from 2022 had been “digitally enhanced at source.”",[]

Ukrainian officials told NBC News that the party was nothing but propaganda, and decried as illegal coercion the votes held for the first time in four newly annexed regions.After three days of voting, Russia’s electoral commission said Putin had received 87% of the ballots, the biggest win of his political career, in what the Kremlin painted as an unequivocal public stamp of approval for his invasion of Ukraine, even though critics of the war were barred from running.Just hours later, the Russian leader was in Red Square, where his face was beamed onto huge screens so that it could be seen from Lenin’s mausoleum and beyond.From a stage beneath the colorful domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral, the music was at times as loud as thunder and the red-brick walls of the Kremlin flickered with the lights of the stage. The crowd — mostly students, some of whom said they had been given free tickets to the event — cheered and sang along as Russian stars performed patriotic ballads.Mostly under 20 years old, many had their faces painted in the colors of the Russian flag. Putin, in power for the last 24 years, is the only leader they have ever known. They may be well into adulthood before seeing another.“He has made Russia a lot better than it was,” Maksim Druzhinin, 18, said, speaking in English.

And this was an especially pro-Putin crowd, not filled with those who turned out at noon Sunday in a silent show of defiance called for by the opposition, or quietly resigned to life under Putin.‘Crimea is not Russian’Putin used the occasion to promise to extend the Russian railroad system all the way to occupied Crimea, as an alternative to the bridge connecting the peninsula to the Russian mainland that has come under frequent Ukrainian attacks.The Russian leader also commended the people of Crimea for what he said was their dedication to Moscow.",[]

Mr. President, is this what you’d call democracy?”Putin, who rarely speaks Navalny’s name, said in response that ""several days before Mr. Navalny perished, I was told by some of my colleagues ... that there is an idea to exchange Mr. Navalny for some people in prison in Western countries."" ""Believe me or not, the person talking to me hardly finished their sentence when I said: 'I agree.' But unfortunately, the thing that happened happened,"" Putin added, speaking as he declared victory in the country's elections. Putin’s remarks came on the last day of a national election in which he claimed a landslide victory. His expected win, following a relentless crackdown on dissent, will extend his nearly quarter-century of rule for six more years. Navalny’s supporters have alleged that Putin had him killed to thwart an imminent prisoner swap that would have freed him and two Americans. Five sources told NBC News that such a deal was being negotiated but that it was not imminent when Navalny died Feb. 16 at age 47.Putin said the swap would have had one condition — that Navalny never return to Russia.On Monday, Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Putin had not confirmed a deal had been in place for Navalny.“He said that an idea was put forward by one of the people about an exchange of Navalny, for which he potentially agreed and immediately told the person who put forward such an idea about this,” Peskov said, according to state news agency Ria. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who is in Berlin, was offered the chance to come to Russia and see her husband ""numerous times,"" but she chose to stay abroad, Peskov later told NBC News. Since Navalnaya declared her ambition to continue her husband's opposition life work, Kremlin propaganda has threatened her with arrest, investigation and even possible jail time upon returning to Russia.  Navalny, a lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner who led opposition to Putin for more than a decade, spent his last days in a Russian penal colony above the Arctic Circle. Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service said he died after having returned from a walk and saying he felt unwell.In 2020, Navalny almost died after he was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent while on a trip in Russia. He was taken to Germany for treatment and was arrested after he returned to Russia — spending his final years behind bars following a conviction on extremism-related charges.His death has been widely blamed on the Kremlin. In a fiery speech at the White House the day Navalny died, President Joe Biden said he had ""no doubt"" Navalny's death ""was the consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did.”The next week, Biden announced more than 500 sanctions he said were designed to hold Russia accountable for Navalny's death and for the country's war with Ukraine. The sanctions target people connected to Navalny’s imprisonment, as well as Russia’s financial and defense sectors, Biden said.“They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home,” he said on Feb. 23.",[]

Speaking with NBC News in Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the “unbelievable level” of support for Putin was the “best sign that all the speculation about illegal elections is actually ungrounded.”The leaders of China, North Korea and Iran were among those who congratulated Putin on his big win. No Western leaders rushed to offer praise. Some, including the U.S., Germany and Britain, dismissed the results as neither free nor fair.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no legitimacy in “this imitation of elections,” accusing Putin of being “addicted to power.”The three other names on the ballot were from parties that have long served the Kremlin’s agenda: Communist Nikolai Kharitonov; leader of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party Leonid Slutsky; and Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, the youngest candidate, whom the Kremlin tried to present as more liberal-leaning.None represented true opposition to Putin, however, having supported his agenda and barely campaigned.Former regional legislator Yekaterina Duntsova and politician Boris Nadezhdin tried to get on the ballot with an anti-war message, but authorities barred them from running.The country was also able to vote electronically and over a span of three days, as the Kremlin sought to encourage a higher turnout that would allow it to claim a wave of support for Putin and his war.Since the full-scale invasion that Putin launched in February 2022, the Kremlin has insisted the entire nation has been “consolidated” around the Russian leader and his growing clash with the West. Putin’s approval ratings have remained high, although gauging public opinion is difficult in Russia as people are often too afraid to speak freely.The Russians who oppose Putin’s war and politics have been ostracized, often forced into exile or persecuted for their views as part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent not seen since the Soviet era.Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking from his campaign headquarters in Moscow on Monday.Alexander Zemlianichenko / APRussia’s opposition has been decimated by years of pressure and devastated by the death of its leader, Alexei Navalny, in a remote Arctic prison just weeks before the election, in what his supporters, family and many Western leaders have called a Kremlin-orchestrated murder.Despite this atmosphere of repression in which mass protests are all but impossible, just before his death Navalny called for people to gather at polling stations on Sunday at noon in a show of dissent.﻿Navalny’s team shared images of people lining up outside polling stations in Moscow and St. Petersburg in apparent ""Noon against Putin"" protests on Sunday.Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, cast her vote in Berlin, telling reporters she voted for her late husband by writing his name into the ballot, as she thanked her fellow citizens for coming out in support.",[]

No casualties or damage were reported.According to the Defense Ministry, another two drones were shot over the Kaluga region just south of the Russian capital and the Yaroslavl region northeast of Moscow.The attacks on the Yaroslavl region, which is located about 500 miles from the Ukrainian border, were some of the farthest launched by Ukraine so far.More Ukrainian drones were downed over the Belgorod, Kursk and Rostov regions that border Ukraine and the southern Krasnodar region, the Defense Ministry said.Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said the Ukrainian shelling killed a 16-year-old girl Sunday and injured her father.A drone fell on a refinery in the Krasnodar region, sparking a blaze that was extinguished a few hours later, according to regional authorities. A worker at the refinery died of a heart attack, officials said.Refineries and oil terminals have been key targets of Ukrainian drone attacks.The attacks followed a series of other Ukrainian drone raids and other attacks over the past few days that Putin described as an attempt by Ukraine to frighten residents and derail Russia’s presidential election.“Those enemy strikes haven’t been and won’t be left unpunished,” he vowed during Friday’s meeting of his Security Council. “I’m sure that our people, the people of Russia, will respond to that with even greater cohesion.”Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military said that 14 Russian drones had been shot down over the Odesa region Sunday. The attack follows a Russian ballistic missile assault on the southern port city Friday, blasting homes and killing at least 21 people. A second missile then targeted first responders who arrived at the scene, officials said.Russian forces also launched five S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles at Ukrainian-controlled areas in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, as well as two X-59 guided missiles in the Chernihiv region, the Ukrainian airforce said.As the war drags into a third year, Russian forces have made some slow and incremental gains along the front line, relying on their edge in firepower, while Ukraine has fought back with more drone attacks deep inside Russia and cross-border raids.On Saturday, two people were killed and three others were wounded in the Ukrainian shelling of the Russian border city of Belgorod which has faced regular attacks.The Russian military also claimed it thwarted another attempted cross-border incursion by Ukrainian “sabotage and reconnaissance groups” on Saturday.The Russian Volunteer Corps — which includes Russians fighting alongside Ukrainian forces — released a video on social media Saturday alleging to have captured 25 Russian soldiers.

At least 53 other people were wounded by the Iskander-M missiles, officials said.At least 10 houses in Odesa and some emergency service equipment were damaged in the strike, which started a blaze, according to emergency officials and regional Gov. Oleh Kiper.The tactic of firing a second missile at the same location, aiming to hit rescuers, is known in military terms as a double tap. Such strikes often hit civilians.Kiper announced that a day of mourning in Odesa would be held on Saturday — the second such observance in less than two weeks.On March 2, a Russian drone struck a multistory building, killing 12 people, including five children.Moscow has repeatedly claimed that its forces do not target civilian areas, despite substantial evidence to the contrary.Since last summer, Russia has intensified its attacks on Odesa, a southern port city with a population of around 1 million.The attacks have primarily targeted port infrastructure, aiming to disrupt the export of goods after Ukraine managed to restore maritime navigation with a series of successful operations in the Black Sea.Moscow officials have also claimed they are aiming at facilities where Ukrainian sea drones are stored for attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.The Odesa region’s ports were key to last year’s international agreement that let Ukraine and Russia ship their grain to the rest of the world.Odesa residents largely speak Russian, and the city’s past is intertwined with some of Russia’s most revered figures, including Catherine the Great, author Leo Tolstoy and poet Anna Akhmatova.Its Orthodox cathedral belongs to Moscow’s patriarchate and — at least until the Kremlin illegally annexed the nearby Crimean Peninsula in 2014 — its beaches were beloved by Russian tourists.Meanwhile, in the Russian border region of Belgorod, regional Gov.

Col. Thomas Driscoll, approached the trench they dug by hand into the mountainside and asked what they needed. “More ammo,” one of them replied.In a nearby tent, fellow soldiers dried snow-saturated cammies over a gas stove. For nearly two weeks, they lived, slept and trained on this stretch of tundra on the northern tip of Norway where temperatures regularly dip below zero. But when the orders came to change position, they packed the tents and hurriedly filled in the ditches. Within around two hours, they’d taken off on snowmobiles and tracked vehicles, leaving barely a trace behind.Lt. Col. Thomas Driscoll of the 2nd Marine Regiment, right, visits troops in trenches dug into the Arctic ice in northern Norway.Carlo Angerer / NBC NewsThe fact that troops from the II Marine Expeditionary Force traveled thousands of miles from their base in North Carolina for two weeks of exercises, is a sign of the Arctic’s emergence as a new battlefield in a growing competition between East and West. As climate change exposes once-unreachable parts of the planet, the U.S., Russia and China are all in a race for military and economic dominance.“The Arctic is absolutely critical,” the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Christopher Mahoney, said in an interview in Norway before the exercises wrapped up this week. “The opening of the Arctic as far as maritime waterways, in lines of communication, make it that much more important.”The Marines were among some 20,000 troops from 13 nations taking part in NATO’s “Nordic Response” exercise, part of larger war games that are the biggest since the Cold War. The exercise extended to Sweden and Finland, NATO’s two newest members, whose addition in the last year added more than 800 miles to the alliance’s border with Russia.The scenario: A major adversary is launching a cross-border invasion from the east, and NATO has been activated to repel them. For the Marines, the U.S. military’s rapid response force, the task was to delay the enemy’s advance until reinforcements arrived.A Swedish soldier takes part in an amphibious assault during a NATO exercise in Badderen, Norway.Carlo Angerer / NBC NewsIt’s a scenario that seems ripped straight from Russia’s war in Ukraine and the resulting fears that Moscow might seek to threaten NATO nations next. U.S. and Norwegian military officials said they have been studying Russia’s successes and failures on the snowy battleground of Ukraine to learn lessons about defending NATO’s northern flank. The officials requested anonymity because they were discussing sensitive intelligence matters.For the U.S. military, it’s a major shift after decades fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and conducting counterinsurgency against extremist groups in the Middle East. Lt. Col. Driscoll, of the 2nd Marine Regiment, said a large part of his 18 years of service had been spent in Iraq and Yemen. “The adversary is very different,” he said. “Now we’re in this tactical scenario facing a large-scale, modernized adversary who brings a lot of capability: long-range, indirect fire, large amounts of reconnaissance. And then you’ve got the actual environment: not the heat of the desert, but the harsh cold.”Corp. Tyler Staehr, 22, brought his expertise operating a HIMARS artillery system — the same kind the U.S. has provided to Ukraine — to an icy stretch of Norway about 150 miles from the Russian border. As the truck-mounted rocket launcher hummed behind him, he recalled learning how to boil snow every morning and night for drinking water.“Here everything’s a little bit more scarce,” said Staehr, from Lancaster, South Carolina. “So you have to rely on yourself and on your team if you want to survive out in the Arctic climate.”U.S. Marines train with High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, at a site near Alta, Norway.Carlo Angerer / NBC NewsAs the U.S. and NATO allies hone their cold-weather skills, Moscow is watching. The Norwegian officials said that they had detected Russian vessels in the area spying on the war games and working to pinpoint their radar positions. While Russian spying on NATO and vice versa is nothing new, Norwegian officials said they’ve detected changes in Russian behavior in recent years, including an increase in electronic warfare like signal-jamming. They also said that Norwegian troops operating near the border have increasingly been approached by Russians in what they suspect is intelligence-gathering.At the same time, Russia’s heavy attrition in its two-year war in Ukraine has forced its military to divert resources away, said Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway’s chief of defense. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military had five times as many troops near its border with Norway before the war. This was proof, he said, that NATO posed no threat to Russia, only the other way around.“President Putin has demonstrated very well that he knows that NATO is a defensive alliance,” Kristoffersen said.Still, it’s no coincidence that the Arctic has become the venue for a new global power struggle.Global warming is quickly melting sea ice, opening up new shipping routes in swaths of Arctic Ocean that are now ice-free during the summer. It has also created new competition for extracting natural resources like oil and natural gas. And undersea data cables in the Arctic are a critical link in global communication systems, relied on by U.S. agencies like NASA.For the U.S., it’s also a matter of national security. If Russia were to ever launch missiles or bomber jets to strike North America, the shortest path would be over the North Pole.Swedish combat boats approach the Norwegian coast during an amphibious assault exercise.Carlo Angerer / NBC NewsA report last year on Arctic power competition from the Washington-based Brookings Institution found that Russia has or is building 30 military or dual-use facilities in the Arctic, including elaborate air bases, ports, nuclear facilities and radio nodes. All told, the country has about three times as many bases as NATO nations inside the Arctic Circle, according to the report’s author, former U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Jeremy Greenwood.Beijing has also its sights set on the Arctic. Western nations were taken aback in 2018 when China declared itself a “near-Arctic state” and promised to develop a “Polar Silk Road.” Greenwood’s report found Chinese companies have worked to buy or build airports, rail facilities, and naval and submarine bases from Greenland to Scandinavia.It’s against this backdrop that a swarm of attack boats cut through the frigid waters and helicopters whipped up the icy air this week, as forces from the U.S., Italy, Finland and other NATO nations practiced an amphibious assault in a Norwegian fjord.As tactical vehicles rolled off ships onto the shore, troops rappelled from the helicopter by rope while others in snow-colored camouflage stormed the coastline with assault rifles.Lance Cpl. Cooper Khoury, 21, from Swansea, Massachusetts, said he never imagined being in the snow when he joined the Marines — known for being an amphibious force — a year and a half ago.“No matter what, we’ll dig in,” he said. “Anywhere we go, I know we can fight. I know we can thrive.”",[]

At the entrance stood a large banner emblazoned with the letter “V” in the colors of the Russian flag and stating the dates of this Friday-Sunday election.Authorities have used the Latin letters “V” and “Z” as unofficial symbols for its war in Ukraine, which has entered its third year with the country’s military advancing on the battlefield.The Kremlin’s expanded control over Russian life means there is no true opposition to Putin, with the three other men on the ballot representing parties loyal to Putin who only campaigned sparingly.Still, some voters said they did not need an alternative.Nina Kisileva, 90, told NBC News as she exited the station that she came out early to vote for another six years of Putin. “Because I trust him. I really trust him,” Kisileva said, adding that she has lived through a slew of Soviet leaders, including Josef Stalin. “I remember when Stalin died, his funeral in 1953, I remember it well. And now I trust only Putin,” she said.Svetlana Kulikova said she voted at the station electronically, an option for the first time this year.Like Kisileva, she said she also voted for Putin. “We live well, we are satisfied with everything and, well, we are very satisfied with our president,” Kulikova, 59, said.Denis Babushkin, who works in highway construction, said that Putin was the only “adequate” candidate out of the four, so he voted for him. “He is the only person who has made others respect Russia as a country recently,” said Babushkin, 39. While he said he was not happy about everything going on in the country, he said the positives still outweigh the negatives. Denis Babushkin.NBC NewsGauging public opinion has become nearly impossible since the beginning of the war, as many people fear speaking out freely amid a crackdown on dissent. But Putin’s approval rating remains high at 86%, according to the independent pollster Levada Center.NBC News also saw a group of 15 municipal workers come in as an organized group to vote and leave together. Russian authorities have in the past faced accusations of making state employees take part in elections. There is not much suspense on this occasion, since two candidates with anti-war views have been barred from running, and there is little independent monitoring of the vote process.But a big turnout would be seen as legitimizing the war and would help to solidify the notion that the country is united around its president, already the longest serving Kremlin leader since Stalin. In 2018, 67% of the eligible voters came out to vote, and the Kremlin will want to boast it has topped that number come Monday.On the eve of the election, Putin, 71, appealed to feelings of patriotism and duty in a special video message, as he encouraged people to vote and demonstrate unity. The Kremlin’s efforts to encourage turnout were evident across Russia on Friday, with videos showing celebrities performing inside polling stations and one region even allowing the public to take photos with a cardboard cutout of Tucker Carlson, the conservative commentator who recently interviewed Putin and has become a favored American personality here. Voters cast their ballots at a school turned polling station in central Moscow on Friday.NBC NewsBut Russian state media also reported on some incidents of disruption, including several cases of people pouring colored dye into or over ballot boxes and others using Molotov cocktails to set polling stations on fire.  The country’s opposition, decimated by a crackdown and the death of its leader Alexei Navalny, has been split on how Russians should treat the election. Some have called for a boycott; others have urged people to spoil their ballots or vote for any candidate other than Putin.The most likely protest will center on a call for Russians to show up en masse at polling stations at noon on Sunday in all of the country’s 11 time zones, in a silent display of their discontent.Some voters at the Moscow polling station told NBC News they knew about the call for this protest. Elena, who did not want her last name revealed, said she knew that it was taking place Sunday, but had an opportunity to vote today. ""I believe that in order to have your own opinion and have an attitude toward something, one doesn’t necessarily need to come at noon on Sunday,"" said Elena, 24, who works as an economist and would not say who she voted for. ""Otherwise, you will come on your own feet, but might not leave on your own.""That was likely a hint at the crackdown by authorities, which has left many Russians fearful of arrest and reluctant to give their last names to foreign media. Perhaps most troublesome for the Kremlin, this week has seen a surge in Ukrainian drone attacks across large parts of Russia, and attempts at a land incursion in the two border regions of Belgorod and Kursk that appear to be ongoing after several days of fighting.The regions’ governors urged people to vote on Friday, but also shared warnings about missile threats and suggested voting electronically if necessary given the potential dangers to people leaving their homes.Addressing an election day meeting of his security council, Putin vowed revenge for what he said was a “criminal” Ukrainian effort “to disrupt the voting process and intimidate the people.”Presidential candidates, including Putin, displayed inside a Moscow polling station on Friday.Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP - Getty ImagesThis is the first presidential election in which people can vote electronically, raising concerns about falsifications and fraud, which have historically plagued Russian elections. Russia's ministry of digital development said 1.6 million people had already voted electronically Friday morning, state news agency Tass reported. An observer from the Communist party, Konstantin Shavlak, said that while they could monitor for any potential violations with paper ballots, the electronic vote was a bit of a mystery that they had no control over. “This is our problem,” said Shavlak, 44. “We always encourage people to vote the old way, using paper ballots. That’s the most reliable, the most honest way.”More than 114 million Russians are eligible to vote in the election, including nearly 2 million abroad. For the first time, people in the four occupied regions of Ukraine annexed by Russia will also be included, in violation of international law in a move condemned by Kyiv and its Western allies.Results are expected to start coming in late Sunday, with a landslide win for Putin expected to be announced on Monday.Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow.

At an event in the Dutch city of Zutphen on Thursday, the country’s King Willem-Alexander was told by a young girl that she had a photograph of him and his family.“At least I didn’t photoshop it!” he said to laughter from the children’s parents.That belies just how serious this crisis has become for the British family’s reputation.It emerged Thursday that Agence France-Presse, one of the news agencies that issued a “kill notice” for Kate’s picture, no longer considers Kensington Palace a “trusted source.”“Making a doctored photo available for distribution to the world’s media is a serious breach of trust,” news director Phil Chetwynd told NBC News in an email. “The palace was a known and trusted source for handout pictures” but “we cannot say they are a trusted source for handout pictures” following this week’s events, he added.He said the news agency “still require further explanations” about what happened to the image and “we would hope we could rebuild this trust over time.”The four agencies, AFP, The Associated Press, Reuters and Getty, all distribute photographs and stories to media companies worldwide.Chetwynd said that “kill notices” were rare, and usually made for propaganda from “the North Korean news agency or the Iranian news agency, just to give you some background or context,” he said in another interview with the BBC.Once the agencies realized “there were a lot of problems with the photo,” they worked together and asked the palace for the original, but decided to kill the picture after not receiving a response, he said.A 'kill notice' issued by the French news agency AFP after the Kensington Palace photo was found to be manipulated.Prince of Wales / Kensington Palace / AFP - Getty ImagesIn a statement posted to social media Monday, Kate said that “like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing” and gave her “apologies for any confusion.” There has been no further explanation for how or why the picture was altered, and the palace has confirmed to NBC News that the original picture will not be released.“Understanding how badly Kensington Palace dealt with this does give us an understanding of why it subsequently turned into such a big deal,” NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew said. “To have completely lost control of the public image of Catherine and William really is quite catastrophic.”For some, the outrage is overblown. But the reason why it has caused such fallout is that it speaks to fundamental tensions between the palace, press and the public.Even many royal supporters do so as part of an unwritten pact: The taxpayer funds the monarchy and in return the royals perform various public roles. These range from international soft-power ambassadors, participants in the occasional lavish wedding to lift the national mood, and fodder for the fashion and gossip pages.The late Queen Elizabeth II understood this tacit agreement better than most, famously saying, “I have to be seen to be believed,” according to biographer Sally Bedell Smith. In short: Without its public presence, the royal family risks losing legitimacy.King Charles III appears to be following this maxim, releasing regular photo updates through his recent cancer diagnosis. But Kate has not been seen in public since Christmas Day, and the edited photo has been the only sighting, save a few unclear, grainy shots of her inside cars.No further details were offered Thursday night at the Diana Legacy Award at London’s Science Museum. William mentioned his wife in passing, saying that his mother’s legacy “is something that both Catherine and I have sought to focus on through our work.”He left before Harry’s speech, delivered virtually from California.The brothers have been mired in a high-profile falling-out following Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, leaving their lives as front-line royals for America while accusing the family of callous treatment. “What should have been a really uplifting event,” McAndrew said, “actually turned into a story about the fact that Harry and William don’t speak to each other and no longer have a relationship.”Also on Thursday, Meghan launched a new brand on Instagram, American Riviera Orchard, marking her return to the platform after deleting her social media accounts in 2018 before marrying Harry. Back in Britain, William made a comment that, knowingly or otherwise, hinted at the maelstrom over his wife’s penchant for visual creativity.“It’s really not that impressive,” he told children as he decorated biscuits while visiting a youth group in west London. “My wife is the arty one.”",[]

Meghan and Harry have established their post-royal life home base in Montecito, California, where they live with their two children. The Instagram bio reads, “By Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.” The page links to a website of the same name as the Instagram handle, though the website is as bare as the social media page itself. In a short Instagram story, Meghan is seen picking flowers and cooking as the song “I Wish You Love” by Nancy Wilson plays in the background.Many appeared to celebrate Meghan's return to social media, citing their love of her previous lifestyle website, The Tig. The former “Suits” star announced she was shuttering the website in 2017, the same year she and Harry got engaged. Some others online began to comment on the timing of the new venture, noting it comes as Buckingham Palace faces scrutiny over Princess Kate's photoshop controversy and her public absence after having surgery. The photoshopped image released Sunday only added fuel to a global firestorm of speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the Princess of Wales. The Palace announced in February that King Charles III had been diagnosed with cancer and would be avoiding public events after being advised by doctors to minimize in-person contacts.Meghan's new venture also comes just one week after she spoke on a panel at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, where she said she is keeping her “distance from [social media] right now just for my own well-being.”The “bulk” of the social media and online “bullying and abuse” she said she experienced came while was pregnant with her children, Archie and Lilibet, and while she had a newborn.Meghan had her first child with Harry, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, on May 6, 2019.

What now?,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kate-popular-face-royal-family-now-rcna143349,2024-03-14T17:55:45.329Z,"LONDON — Though she is formally known as Catherine, the Princess of Wales, for millions worldwide she will always just be Kate Middleton: The English commoner who married a prince and whose elegant but accessible image has cemented her as Britain’s favorite royal.That’s why the saga around her unexplained surgery and subsequent altered family photo has been so damaging for this ancient institution, commentators say. Particularly coming at a time when the royals find themselves short of headline acts, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the recent cancer diagnosis of King Charles III, and with Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, living in California.Until her leave of absence, Kate had been picking up the slack, both a reliable royal foot soldier and someone able to bring star power to even the most mundane ribbon-cutting event. And Kate and her husband, William, the Prince of Wales, had largely navigated their desire for privacy with their growing public duties once he became heir to the throne.“William and Kate are individually extremely popular — they are the two most popular members of the royal family,” NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew said. “Kate, even more than William, has always had this can-do-no-wrong reputation, so for her to be criticized will be tough for the royal family to swallow.”Kate, the Princess of Wales, during the coronation of King Charles in London.Odd Andersen / AFP via Getty Images fileThough Charles is king and William is his heir, it is Kate — the future queen — who regularly polls as the nation’s favorite member of this birthright clan.Once again this week, a survey from pollster Ipsos had Kate as the most popular royal, with 38% of the 1,085 respondents in Britain ranking her as their No.1 ahead of William. Though released Wednesday, it was conducted prior to the British Mother’s Day photo scandal.Of course, that popularity is not universal, particularly since the very public falling out between William and Kate, and Harry and Meghan. Almost every royal storyline is now framed by the media as part of the wider struggle between cheerleaders for Team Wales and those for Team Sussex.The latter have claimed that race has been a factor in Meghan’s treatment by parts of British media, which has at times seemed harsher than the coverage given to Kate. One tabloid columnist referred to Meghan’s “exotic” DNA and a Daily Mail headline described her Los Angeles roots as “(almost) straight outta Compton.” The same newspaper ran photos of a pregnant Meghan cradling her pregnancy bump under the headline: “Why can’t Meghan Markle keep her hands off her bump?” Months earlier, it had described a pregnant Kate as “tenderly” cradling her bump.Even this week, while British newspapers have covered the saga at length, much of the commentary has been gentle.“GIVE KATE A BREAK,”  the right-wing Daily Mail, the country’s top-selling newspaper, thundered on its front page Thursday. The Sun, another popular British tabloid, managed to make the Sussexes the focus of the story with, “MEGHAN AND HARRY ENTER KATE PIC ROW.”“She is a source of fascination,” royal commentator Tim Ewart told NBC News on Thursday. “Bear in mind that the public and the media do not have the intense interest in the king” — fifth-most popular in the Ipsos poll — “that they do in the princess of Wales, Kate.”Kate and Prince William in 2020.Joe Giddens / WPA Pool / Getty ImagesKate, 42, grew up in Berkshire, an affluent county to the west of London, raised by entrepreneur parents. She went to Marlborough College, an exclusive private school whose fees today are as much as $60,000 a year. She then studied art history at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, which has one of the lowest percentages of state-educated students of any university in Britain.It was here that she met William in 2001, their relationship coming to public attention when they were photographed together while skiing in Switzerland. They married in 2011 despite briefly splitting in 2007.It has not always been a smooth ride with the press. Her lawyers asked photographers to leave her alone in 2005, as she was learning to navigate post-grad working life while in the glare of being a royal girlfriend. In 2012, the couple sued a French magazine for publishing topless pictures of her, taken while she was vacationing at a villa in the south of the country. But those were blips for a couple who have always been seen as more willing to play the game than Harry and Meghan: rarely voicing their opinions, and seeking to control the press and public narrative rather than lashing out against it so openly.That is, until now, with the altered photo — and the fact that she was not wearing her wedding ring in it — only adding fuel to a fire of conspiracy theories and speculation about her health and personal life that the royals are struggling to put out. It has also risked tarnishing the halo, in the eyes of many, of someone whose almost unblemished public relations record was perhaps only rivaled by the late queen herself.While Kate may share the inoffensive persona that partly explained the queen’s popularity, it may be Elizabeth’s absence and the goodwill buffer she provided that have made the critique of the future queen feel more stark, McAndrew said.“People knew that when we did go into a post-Queen Elizabeth era, the scrutiny would be more intense. That was something that the royal family knew was coming and knew that they had to prepare for,” she said. “And I think that probably is what we’re seeing now.”",[]

His war in Ukraine has recast life at home and intensified a clash with the West now shadowed by the uncertainty of America’s own election. Russia’s military is advancing on the battlefield and its economy has shown surprising resilience in the face of global sanctions. The victory orchestrated by the Kremlin, however, will bely signs of fragility behind that choreographed show.Despite an atmosphere of repression not seen since the Soviet era, there have been sprouts of internal dissent and external attacks ahead of the election that have pierced the picture of unity and stability the Kremlin has cultivated.“The results have been announced in advance,” said Nikolai Rybakov, chairman of Russia’s liberal political party Yabloko, which decided not to join the race this year. “It’s painful, unpleasant and shameful but you have to admit that you can’t influence the results right now,” he said in a phone interview from Moscow this week.“We see that people have an internal demand for peace and changes for the better. But it’s hard for people to resist the ever-present propaganda of hate and anti-Westernism. And on the other hand, people see what criticism of the government can lead to,” he added. “People are afraid for their lives and the lives of their loved ones, and you can’t blame them.”War and repressionSix years ago, Putin’s victory in the 2018 election was also a foregone conclusion. But his army was not waging a brutal full-scale war across the border, opposition leader Alexei Navalny was still a free man investigating official corruption, some independent press could still operate inside the country and Russia was preparing to welcome the world for the men’s soccer World Cup. Back then, Putin’s regime was repressive but more wary of how it was perceived. The invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has changed that. But Putin appears to be in a stronger position than at any point in his 24 years in power. His approval rating remains high at 86%, with 76% of Russians supporting his war in Ukraine, according to the independent pollster Levada Center. Of course gauging public opinion is difficult in Russia, with relentless propaganda boosting the Kremlin’s narrative and people often too afraid to speak freely.Perhaps one crucial factor is that the country’s economy has largely weathered international sanctions. Western brands have been replaced by Russian ones, and closer ties with Asia, particularly China, have helped fill some gaps.Inflation is higher than 7%, meaning that prices have soared for some everyday goods — including eggs, leading to a high-profile shortage that forced Kremlin intervention. But official statistics show wages are rising and, in general, there has been little economically to shake Russians from their everyday lives.",[]
tech,False,Neutral,"['University of Westminster', 'The Sunday Times', 'Goff Photos', 'Cardiff University']",Princess Kate's edited photo deepens the mistrust the palace hoped to quell,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kates-edited-photo-mistrust-media-conspiracy-rcna143254,2024-03-13T18:31:02.959Z,"LONDON — Royal images have been manipulated since at least the 1590s when artists painted Queen Elizabeth I as a young woman despite her being more than 60 years old.But the edited photo of Kate, the Princess of Wales, and her three children has stirred up a decidedly modern controversy as it has inflamed conspiracy theories about her whereabouts, while raising questions about the royal family’s role in constructing its own image and how, or whether, it can be trusted to do so.  After the revelations that the photo to mark Mother’s Day in Britain  — the first public depiction of Prince William's wife since December — had been manipulated, international news agencies pulled the image, making it clear they will no longer stand for even superficial edits when it comes to palace handouts. A mistrustful public began poring over every pixel for evidence of falsification.Some media and royal experts say that this will stand as a pivotal event, after which the palace and perhaps other public figures will be far more cautious in terms of the images they distribute.“If they didn’t know already, they will know now that they’re going to be held accountable — and quite rightly,” said Steven Barnett, a communications professor at London’s University of Westminster. “We’re talking about the heir to the throne. In British constitutional terms, King Charles I is the head of state, and his son is the heir to that state.”“We know that pictures that have been put out before have always been edited — every single royal image going back decades,” said Roya Nikkhah, a royal correspondent with The Sunday Times. But this time, she added, “I think there’ll be lessons learned for the palace PR operation.”British newspaper's analysis of Kate's altered Mother's Day photo.Paul Ellis / AFP - Getty Images The relationship between public figures, the press and the truth has never been a straightforward one. The range of fakery spans airbrushed cellulite in fashion magazines to Soviet officials being purged from official photographs after falling out of favor with Joseph Stalin.That skepticism is only growing with the rise of artificial intelligence and improvements in cheap editing software, as well as the informational Wild West that is social media. It’s on these platforms that an ecosystem of conspiracy theories has been thriving, with self-appointed detectives analyzing every detail of the royals’ pictures for evidence of deception or subterfuge.These corners of the internet will always exist. But after this week, Kate and William, the Prince of Wales, will be eager not to fall foul of the traditional media’s (not always infallible) rules on accuracy, Barnett said.“Certainly William and Kate will be much more careful now, and their PR advisers will be much more careful about putting stuff out on their own accounts,” Barnett said. “They will want to make doubly sure that they’re not misleading people, whether it’s willful or whether it’s accidental.”This also speaks to a latent tension between the royal family and the media. The royals often demand the same kind of privacy that might be afforded a regular family; the news media reminds them that they are, in fact, a deeply political public institution, one with vast influence and funded by around $110 million from taxpayers each year.Before this weekend, the hashtag #WhereisKate was mainly a forum for tin foil hats and people making light-hearted memes about the regal soap opera. But the manipulated photo has given those theories mass market appeal, with aspiring influencers appointing themselves photoshop sleuths to carry out audits of everything released by the royal family.One image in particular, showing Kate leaving her home in Windsor Castle, prompted some people to claim that the pattern of bricks in one part of the image did not match another.Goff Photos, the agency that distributed the photo, said in a statement that  “image has been cropped and lightened, nothing has been doctored.”The thing that catapulted this week’s drama to a different level was the decision by four international news agencies to very publicly and pointedly retract the photo from their platforms.“There’s a lot of distrust around journalism, sometimes with good reason, particularly given the reputation of the tabloid press in this country,” Barnett said. “But this incident reminds the rest of the world that there is a real value to journalists and journalism in being the gatekeepers of authenticity.”Drawing a line in the sand on Kate’s photo was “good for all of us in terms of media literacy, and people understanding they should be perhaps skeptical of some of the things they see,” he added.Not everyone is so optimistic about the effect this debacle might have on media standards and transparency.“I suspect the royals will go back to using professional photographers in future, who of course airbrush and photoshop all the time,” Richard Sambrook, an emeritus professor specializing in journalism at Cardiff University, wrote in a message. “I’d love to think it would set new transparency standards for entertainment and celebs but the chances of that in my view are zero!”",[]

But he said this doesn't mean the world is heading for nuclear war, and suggested that President Joe Biden’s experience ensures that he understands the potential dangers of escalation.His comments come just days ahead of the March 15-17 presidential election that will see him re-elected for the fifth time to begin another six-year term.It’s the second occasion in less than two weeks in which Putin has used nuclear rhetoric, and his latest foray into America's upcoming election.During his annual state of the nation address last month, Putin warned Western countries that if they send their own troops into Ukraine, they risk a nuclear war. His comments came after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that NATO allies could send troops to Ukraine in the future.Putin said in the interview Wednesday that U.S. troops on the ground in either Russia or Ukraine would be seen as an intervention. But he said Biden is an old-school politician, and there are plenty of specialists in strategic deterrence in Washington to keep that from happening.“So I don’t think that here everything is rushing so head-on” to a nuclear confrontation, he said, according to a transcript of the interview shared by the Kremlin. “But we are ready for this.”In line with the country’s stated security doctrine, Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons “if we are talking about the existence of the Russian state, about the threat to our sovereignty and independence,” Putin added.He also said he never pondered deploying nuclear weapons in Ukraine, even when Kyiv reclaimed some of its land in successful counteroffensives in 2022. “There has never been such a need,” he said.Putin has substantially ramped up his nuclear saber rattling since his invasion of Ukraine. Although Washington maintains that it does not see a change in Russia’s nuclear stance, Putin’s drastic rhetoric has raised fears about the risks of a clash between Russia and the West.“Overall, the tone of the interview, not only the ‘nuclear’ part, was positive and reassuring — Russia was in a good position, the situation was stable, and there was no need to worry,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. “The seemingly muted reaction to possibility of West sending troops to Ukraine would be interesting to follow,” he added.The declaration of Russia’s readiness for a nuclear war came as Putin said that Russia was ready for peace talks in Ukraine based on “realities” on the ground, and not what he called “some wants after the use of psychotropic drugs.” This was an apparent reference to the Kremlin's long-standing and baseless claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a drug user. “For us to negotiate now just because they are running out of ammunition is somewhat ridiculous on our part,” Putin said, referring to severe ammunition shortages that Ukraine has experienced as new U.S. military aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s European counterparts have struggled to supply the ammunition that has been promised.“We are, however, ready for a serious conversation,” he said, adding that Moscow would not just negotiate a pause in fighting that would allow Ukraine to re-arm, but one that would secure serious security guarantees for Russia.The White House announced Tuesday that it would provide $300 million in additional weapons to Ukraine amid the congressional holdup. Putin was also asked about his stated preference for the “more experienced” Biden rather than the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, to win this year’s U.S. election.Putin said that Trump, who had often praised the Russian leader, reproached him during his final year in office for wanting Biden to win the 2020 election.“He told me so in one of the conversations. Sorry, I’ll say it like he did, it’s just direct speech: ‘You want Sleepy Joe to win,’” Putin recalled, using a label Trump often uses for Biden.“And then, to my surprise, they began to persecute him because we allegedly supported him as a candidate,” Putin said of Trump. “Well, it’s some kind of complete nonsense.”",[]

Perpetrators will have to answer for their crime.”The attack took place nearly a month after Navalny’s unexplained death in a remote Arctic penal colony. He was Russia’s best-known opposition figure and Putin’s fiercest critic.

The longer-range version of the missile would allow Ukraine to strike farther inside the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula.In recent months, Russian forces have gained ground in Ukraine, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stepped up his pleas for additional military aid, saying his army is in desperate need of ammunition and other weapons.",[]

He was referring to the Duchess of Sussex, the wife of Prince Harry who is so often vilified by the British media. “Or if the White House did this, and Joe Biden looked younger and better than he actually is, I think that might finish his presidential bid, I really do,” he said. “This is very serious.”The palace did not respond on the record to NBC News’ requests for comment.Kate’s last public appearance was Christmas Day, when she was seen leaving a church service at the royal family’s Sandringham Estate. On Jan. 17, the palace announced that she had undergone “planned abdominal surgery,” without offering any more details, and that she would be hospitalized for up to two weeks while avoiding public duties until the end of March.Last week, she was photographed in a car being driven by her mother near Windsor Castle, although no British newspaper ran the picture, citing privacy concerns. Stoking the intrigue further, a day later the British Army posted — and then hastily deleted — a statement saying that Kate would attend its Trooping the Color ceremony on June 8.Then, just as the speculation was reaching a crescendo, came the photo. William and Kate posted a picture to their social media channels showing Kate in a garden with the couple’s three children, Prince Louis, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, and the palace said it was taken by the heir to the throne himself.The inconsistencies were quickly noted on social media, which led to the world’s biggest news agencies pulling the image from their platforms, threatening to elevate the saga into a fundamental threat to public trust in the royals. The apology by Kensington Palace contrasted with the treatment described by Harry and Meghan, who complained that the palace never backed them up when Meghan was subjected to racist coverage in the British media.Some British media outlets have remained supportive of the Prince and Princess of Wales, The Sun, for example, demanding “LAY OFF KATE,” and “stop bullying over edited pic,” on its front page Monday. And 49% of the respondents to a YouGov poll Monday said the palace had released the right amount of information about Kate’s health.But the brief statement, which leaves plenty of questions unanswered, is unlikely to silence the debate, according to Steve Double, a partner at the London-based crisis PR firm Alder.“Trying to draw a line under it is fairly good practice,” Double said. “But you’ve only got to look at this morning’s newspapers and the online chatter from the last 24 hours to see that Kate’s apology and minimal explanation simply hasn’t worked in terms of closing things down.”The Princess of Wales is one of the most popular royals. Max Mumby / Indigo / Getty Images fileThis is a rare instance of William and Kate seeming to get it wrong when it comes to the press. The couple usually run a tight media ship, even advertising last year for a CEO to run their operations — a novelty in the more old-fashioned royal family that has traditionally relied heavily on courtiers.To hear Harry tell it, his brother hasn’t been afraid to mix it up with the media. “It’s a dirty game,” Harry said in an episode of “Harry & Meghan,” the Netflix docuseries released in 2022. “There’s leaking, but there’s also planting of stories.”The brothers were united in their mistrust of the press following the 1997 death of their mother, Princess Diana, in a crash in Paris while her car was being chased by press photographers.They “believe — and still believe — that their mother was martyred by the paparazzi,” royal author Tina Brown said in her 2022 book “The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor — The Truth and the Turmoil.”And so the princes “express their contempt for the press in different ways,” Brown wrote. “William with a grim, steely obsession with control; Harry with tortured, vocal, frequently ill-judged condemnation” and a “never-ending flurry of lawsuits” against the media, she said.Whatever the intentions, the palace’s strategy has not worked. What may have happened, according to McAndrew, is that “their staff were saying, ‘We need something, we need to feed the beast,’ and they said, ‘Well, you can give them this photograph — it’s that or nothing.’”Based on his own experience, Double said he believes the couple’s team will be urging them to release more details, but that “the prince and princess may have dug their heels in.”“It’s been pretty clear where they want to draw the line in terms of privacy, and they think what they said is enough,” he added, “when it clearly isn’t.”",[]

The Kremlin, which has worked hard to burnish an image of domestic calm despite the war in Ukraine, said it had successfully fought off the attempted incursions. But it was impossible to verify either side's claims, and attacks like this could unnerve the Russian public ahead of the election. The Russian defense ministry reported early Tuesday that 25 drones had been intercepted over at least seven regions, in one of Ukraine's most wide-ranging aerial attacks in recent months. The ministry did not report on any damage or casualties, only saying the drones had been destroyed. But some local governors reported that fuel and energy facilities had been hit, including an oil refinery that was ablaze in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 480 miles from the Ukraine border.The ministry separately reported that it destroyed eight rockets and one Tochka-U missile over Belgorod region, which has been routinely shelled by Ukraine since the early months of the war.Ukraine normally does not take responsibility for attacks on Russian soil, but has increasingly targeted energy facilities in recent months with drones that can strike deep behind Russian lines.Incursions into Russia?Meanwhile, a trio of Ukraine-based armed groups purporting to be Russian volunteers opposed to the Kremlin said they had staged overnight raids across the border.The groups released videos on the Telegram messaging app claiming to show their fighters inside Russia, with some moving on what appear to be tanks. NBC News could not verify those videos.The Freedom of Russia Legion claimed to have crossed Russia's western border near the village of Tetkino in the Kursk region and said it had hit an armored personnel carrier in the village. The group released a video statement early Tuesday in which it criticized Putin's hold on power and said it was fighting to free the Russian people from “misery, poverty and fear.” The Russian Volunteer Corps, which staged a dramatic cross-border incursion alongside the Legion last May, also said that it had again crossed into Russia, without elaborating on exactly where. It released a video of its fighters in an undisclosed location, shooting in the dark. The group's leader and some members have endorsed neo-Nazi ideologies.Another military group that calls itself the Siberian Battalion also claimed to have crossed the border Tuesday. “We said earlier that it would not be possible to overthrow the criminal dictatorial regime in the Russian Federation peacefully. It can only be eliminated with weapons in hand,” it said in a post on Telegram. “Tonight we began to fulfill the promise.” It later shared a video claiming to show its fighters in Russia and calling on the country's citizens to vote with weapons, not ballots.NBC News could not independently verify any of the groups' claims. Kursk region governor Roman Starovoit said Tuesday that there was an attempt at an incursion by a sabotage group, which resulted in a shootout, but there was no “breakthrough.” He said the village of Tetkino had been shelled from the Ukrainian side since the morning. There was no confirmation of an incursion from Belgorod’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.Russia’s defense ministry said that its armed forces and border units of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) had ""thwarted an attempt by the Kyiv regime to break into the Russian border territory in the Belgorod and Kursk regions."" The early morning attacks were repelled, the ministry said, and there were no violations of the state border. Up to 60 ""Ukrainian terrorists"" and five tanks were destroyed in the fighting, it added.Near the village of Tetkino in the Kursk region, it said four attacks by ""Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups"" were repelled. ""Having suffered significant losses, the enemy was driven back,"" the ministry said. Moscow has consistently framed the groups as acting on the orders of the Ukrainian military, while Kyiv has said they are acting of their own accord.Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said Tuesday that the groups are made up of Russian citizens and act on Russian territory independently of Ukraine. “We are probably talking about a joint operation of these units, in particular in Belgorod and Kursk regions,” Yusov told Radio Freedom, commenting on the reports of the raids.Russia heads to the polls on Friday for a three-day vote, which is all but guaranteed to see Putin come out victorious on a ballot with no real opposition. The Kremlin has tried to project an image of national unity and stability ahead of the election, but Tuesday's attacks could become an unwelcome distraction.",[]

China “may attempt to influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. societal divisions.”Chinese government “actors have increased their capabilities to conduct covert influence operations and disseminate disinformation,” the assessment said. “TikTok accounts run by a PRC [People’s Republic of China] propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022.”China is now displaying a greater sophistication in its influence efforts and is experimenting with artificial intelligence software, the report said.Asked about foreign adversaries’ using AI-enabled tools to spread disinformation before the 2024 election, FBI Director Christopher Wray said at the hearing that “AI is something that all of our most significant adversaries are taking a hard look at to enhance their efforts.”He added: “We have seen it used in a variety of settings. Whether it’s been used specifically to target voters, I’m not sure that I could say that. But we are actively concerned about that as the latest wrinkle in a long-standing effort to engage in information warfare.”Under questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., about the potential threat posed by TikTok, Wray acknowledged that TikTok’s U.S. branch could be directed by the Chinese government to use algorithms that could target certain political candidates in the U.S. election.“That’s my understanding,” Wray said.The Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, warned that an array of American adversaries is churning out disinformation before elections are held in the U.S. and dozens of other countries this year.“And I am deeply concerned that democracy, including in the United States, is under greater threat than ever from these foreign adversaries. Bad actors like Russia are particularly incentivized to interfere, given what’s at stake in Ukraine,” Warner said at the hearing.Iran, which has forged closer ties to Russia since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, also is expected to keep up its information operations to try to sow division in the U.S., including possibly interfering in the 2024 election, the intelligence assessment said.“Iran will continue to conduct malign influence operations in the Middle East and in other regions, including trying to undermine U.S. political processes and amplify discord,” it said.“Ahead of the U.S. election in 2024, Iran may attempt to conduct influence operations aimed at U.S. interests, including targeting U.S. elections, having demonstrated a willingness and capability to do so in the past,” the assessment said.",[]

Twenty years ago on March 11, 2004, 10 bombs detonated almost simultaneously on four commuter trains in Madrid. The blasts initially killed 191 people and injured over 1,800 commuters during the morning rush hour.The Madrid train bombing is the second-deadliest terrorist attack in Europe, after the takedown of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.Initial reports attributed the Madrid attack to an independent local terrorist cell. But conclusive evidence has since connected the train bombing with the Sept. 11 attack in the United States, which had happened 30 months earlier. “We now know, based on the research that has been done by Spanish investigators, that the attack of March 11 was an Al Qaeda operation,” said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and an expert on the Middle East. “And that the cell that carried out the operation had also been in touch with the cell that had also carried out 9/11. So this is very much relevant to Americans looking back at the events of 9/11.”Riedel served in the White House on Sept. 11, 2001, as a senior adviser to President George W. Bush. And he describes the terrorist attack as “the defining moment for Americans born in the last half-century.” “9/11 was a national trauma for the United States. It led to a massive rally around the flag,” he said. “While we may have forgotten 20-something years later, there was bipartisan support for going into Iraq and toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan.”But the decision to go into Iraq, Riedel said, would ultimately weaken that bipartisan support and polarize the country between those in favor and those against the war.Nevertheless, he also pointed out that in addition to both wars, Sept. 11 transformed the American government with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center.In Spain, with the bombing happening just three days before the national election, the country faced deep divisions.“The disunity stemmed from differing attributions of blame for the commuter train massacre,” terrorism expert Fernando Reinares wrote in the book “Al-Qaeda’s Revenge,” which contains a forward from Riedel and received an award from the association for the victims of 3/11.A body is lifted from the wreckage of a commuter train in Madrid on March 11, 2004.Bruno Vincent / Getty Images“The aftereffects of that disunity persisted for well over a decade,” Reinares wrote, breaking them down in the book.Those on the right tended to believe that ETA, the Basque nationalist and separatist organization classified as a terrorist group by Spain, was implicated in the Madrid bombing, as the Spanish government initially reported. And those on the left tended to believe that the bombing was payback for Spain’s participation in the Iraq War.Both beliefs, Reinares wrote, are false.“There is no direct or indirect evidence that ETA was somehow involved in the bomb attacks. Nor is it true that the idea of perpetrating a massacre in Madrid originated in response to the presence of Spanish soldiers on Iraqi soil,” he wrote.Reinares pointed out in the book that the decision to carry out a terrorist attack was made in December 2001 in Karachi, Pakistan. And recruitment efforts for a 3/11 network began in March 2002, “well over a year before the Iraq invasion would take place.”In Spain, the idea of a local home group being the mastermind of the Madrid attack persisted, even after the National Court handed down sentences ranging from three to 43,000 years in 2007 over the train bombings.One of the main targets of the Spanish investigation, Amer Azizi, whom an indictment called a leader of a Spanish Al Qaeda cell and who was indicted a month after the 3/11 attacks on charges of  helping plan the 9/11 terrorist attacks, was still at large during the trial.The 2022 documentary “11M: Terror in Madrid” reported that his death became publicly known after Al Qaeda confirmed it in 2009.“Azizi’s importance was not understood until he was killed with his boss, Hamza Rabia,” Manuel R. Torres, a political science professor at Pablo de Olavide University, said in the documentary. According to Reinares’ book, Azizi got approval from Al Qaeda for an attack on Madrid and became a key go-between of the top leaders of the terrorist organization in Pakistan and the 3/11 network in Spain.In retrospect, Riedel said that underestimating Al Qaeda and shifting focus to Iraq was a big mistake that cost both the U.S. and Spain lives and money.“We should have kept our eye on the ball and continued after 9/11 to pursue Al Qaeda relentlessly until we had destroyed the leadership. Instead, we went into the wrong desert and chased the wrong bad guy,” he said. “I think 3/11 and 9/11 underscore the importance of the United States and Europe working together against our common enemies,” Riedel said, “and to that extent it underscores the importance of having a NATO alliance that brings Americans and Europeans together when we face dangerous crises.”",[]

He urged Ukraine to have what he called “the courage of the white flag.”The response by outraged Ukrainians was immediate.“Our flag is a yellow and blue one. This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail. We shall never raise any other flags,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote Sunday on X.Kuleba also called out the Vatican for its “strategy” in the first half of the 20th century, an apparent reference to accusations that the Catholic Church failed to act against the Nazis during World War II. “I urge to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past,” he added.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued his own thinly veiled criticism in his nightly address Sunday, accusing Francis, without naming him directly, of “virtually mediating” the conflict from thousands of miles away.“Russian murderers and torturers are unable to march farther into Europe only because they are being held back by Ukrainians holding arms under the blue-and-yellow flag,” Zelenskyy said. “There used to be many white walls of houses and churches in Ukraine, but they have now been scorched and ruined by Russian shells. This speaks volumes about who needs to stop for the war to end.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to criticize the pope Sunday for ""virtual mediating"" of the war from afar. Vatican Pool / Getty Images fileUkraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, said Kyiv could not accept that the victim of the aggression, rather than the aggressor, was being asked to raise the white flag. “Nobody at the time of World War II was proposing to the people enslaved by Hitler or those who were suffering or fighting him to start peace negotiations,” Yurash said in a phone interview from the Vatican. “Because a truce with Hitler was suicide and death. Similarly, a truce with Putin is suicide and death.”And the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church responded to Francis’ comments Sunday by saying Ukrainians “cannot stop defending themselves, because capitulation means their death.”Some of Ukraine’s closest allies were also critical. “How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine?” Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski wrote on X. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also appeared to address the pope’s remarks Monday, without directly referring to him. “President Putin started this war and he could end it today, but Ukraine does not have this option,” Stoltenberg said. “Surrender is not peace.”Francis sparked fury last year by praising Russia’s imperial rulers — the historical pretext that President Vladimir Putin often uses to help justify his invasion. The pope also said in the early months of the war that “NATO’s barking at Russia’s door” may have precipitated the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor.Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni sought to clarify the pope’s remarks, saying that the term “white flag” was part of the interviewer’s question and the that pope was repeating it. Francis supported “a cessation of hostilities, a truce reached with the courage of negotiation,” Bruni said, not Ukraine’s outright surrender.The critical reaction reflects Kyiv’s reluctance to publicly consider peace negotiations while Putin remains in power, despite growing signs that its Western allies are growing weary of supporting the war and might share in the pope’s views that, sooner or later, Kyiv will have to take a seat at the negotiating table.That trend could intensify if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, given his friendly relationship with Putin and his stated intention of ending the war within 24 hours if elected, without saying how.Ukraine has faced ammunition shortages on the front lines as new military aid from Washington remains stalled. Jose Colon / Anadolu via Getty ImagesMoscow has been publicly pushing for peace negotiations since the early months of the war, but only on conditions that are favorable to Russia. Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to push the Russian army back to its borders as they stood at the time it gained independence in 1991, which implies the ambitious goal of reclaiming the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula.Ukraine’s war effort has been seriously hampered in recent months by stalled U.S. aid, ammunition shortages and growing discord among its backers. The Kremlin has taken advantage, with its army making steady advances on the battlefield.Asked about Francis’ comments Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin had also repeatedly talked about “our readiness and openness to solve our problems by way of negotiations” but that Kyiv had rejected any possibility of talks.Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv and Yuliya Talmazan from London.",[]

""I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused.""Confusion is one word for the preceding 24 hours, in which the internet guessing game ranged from measured analysis to outright conspiratorial conjecture. This had already been rife after Kate took an extended step back from her royal duties following the unspecified surgery. But the photo, an intended fire blanket, instead acted as gasoline.“It has been really quite a wild 24 hours here,” Roya Nikkhah, a royal commentator and correspondent with The Sunday Times, told NBC News. “It was supposed to quell all the gossip and rumor and very strange conspiracy theories that have been going around on social media,” she said. “But then people started noticing slight discrepancies in the photographs, things that looked like they’ve been photoshopped.”At first it was just social media sleuths pointing out apparent discrepancies with the picture. But then four of the world’s largest news agencies — The Associated Press, Reuters, Getty Images and Agence France-Presse — all issued what are known as “kill notices,” an advisory for broadcasters and newspapers not to use the image.A ""Photo Kill"" notice The Associated Press sent to editors.Prince of Wales / Kensington Palace / APThe picture was posted on William and Kate’s Instagram account to mark Mother's Day in the U.K. on Sunday and released officially by their residence, Kensington Palace.It shows Kate posing in a garden with the couple’s three children — Prince Louis, Prince George and Princess Charlotte — and the palace said it was taken by William, the Prince of Wales.Usually such a photo would attract positive front-page coverage throughout the British press, allowing the royals to get out their intended message in a carefully managed way. But newspapers that can usually be relied upon to support the royals did not shy away from the controversy Monday morning. “This joyous Mother’s Day snap was meant to be the reassurance we all needed. But has it backfired?” the Daily Mail asked.Before Kensington Palace’s explanatory social media post, NBC News had requested comment from the household without reply. An NBC News analysis of the photo suggests at least two inconsistencies where manipulation of the image appears to have occurred.The first is a misalignment between Charlotte’s cardigan and left wrist, which bears the hallmarks of the “clone stamp” tool featured in Adobe’s hugely popular Photoshop editing software.This allows users to take part of an image and copy it over to another area, and it is often used to clean up an unwanted detail.The second apparent inconsistency is behind Louis’ right knee, where there is a break in the line of the wall.Here it appears the same clone stamp tool might have been used, perhaps an attempt to clean up the young prince’s trouser line. In using this method, the editor might not have noticed the impact it appears to have had on another part of the image. The photo’s metadata — code embedded within the picture that gives details of how it was taken — shows that it was captured using an “EFS50mm” lens. This shows that this was not a smartphone photo, but instead one taken with a single-lens reflex camera, or digital SLR, made by the manufacturer Canon.It also shows the aperture, which is the amount of light let through by the lens, which in this instance would have given the photo a very narrow field of focus.This would explain why some aspects of the image appear soft and even slightly blurry.Far from any nefarious plot, photography experts said the photo may simply have been edited to circumvent the challenge of getting three kids to sit still and smile all at the same time.But the kill notice put out by the photo agencies is nonetheless a rare and serious step.""When this picture initially dropped in hit all our social media channels, everyone just breathed a sigh of relief because here was Catherine looking beautiful and healthy and happy and clearly recovering well,"" NBC News royal contributor Katie Nicholl said.""But within hours of that image coming out, four international press picture agencies decided to kill that image,"" she told NBC's ""TODAY."" ""I certainly can't remember this ever happening in my career as a royal correspondent.""Some royal observers saw it as another needless public relations misstep by the royal family as it navigates a new era after the death of the widely popular Queen Elizabeth II.King Charles III was lauded for sharing his cancer diagnosis last month. But many doctors and other health experts faulted him for withholding which type of cancer it was, making it hard for members of the public to follow his example and get themselves checked.That tension between the modern demand for details and the royals’ tradition of secrecy was apparent, too, with the vacuum of information around Kate’s surgery and withdrawal from view. “Royal press management isn’t easy,” Catherine Mayer, author of “Charles: The Heart of a King,” said in a post on X. “But this doesn’t explain serial mistakes in royal comms.”She said that even releasing the photo of Kate itself, with no other details, was a questionable tactic: “Either you feed demands for information or you don’t.”",[]

That count could take more than two weeks.The hard-right Chega (Enough) party came in third with 48 seats, a milestone result that presented an unprecedented challenge to politics-as-usual, underscoring a drift to the right in the European Union.Smaller parties took the rest of the vote in an election that saw turnout rise to 66%, the highest level in Portugal in years.The moderate Social Democrats and Socialists have alternated in power for decades in Portugal, and the surge in support for a radical right party pointed to a significant shift in Portugal’s political landscape and most likely heralded a period of political uncertainty.A minority government that has fewer than 116 seats in Parliament is at the mercy of opposition parties when it tries to pass legislation. Chega’s support could hold the key to a functioning government for the Social Democrats.Chega, just five years old, tripled its vote from the last election in 2022. The result positioned the party as a kingmaker that potentially could hand the Social Democrats a parliamentary majority.Whatever happens, Chega can no longer be ignored despite attempts to shun it by the mainstream parties.“One thing is for sure tonight, the two-party system in Portugal is finished,” said Chega leader Andre Ventura.He insisted that the Social Democrats should ally with Chega in parliament to create a majority. “We have a mandate to govern,” he said.But Social Democrat leader Luis Montenegro, who most likely would become prime minister if his alliance wins, said he would keep his campaign promise to shut out Chega and refuse to negotiate power-sharing with the populists. He said he expected to form a government on his own.Ventura, a former law professor and television soccer pundit, has said he is prepared to drop some of his party’s most controversial proposals — such as chemical castration for some sex offenders and the introduction of life prison sentences — if that enables his party’s inclusion in a possible governing alliance with other right-of-center parties.His insistence on national sovereignty instead of closer European Union integration and his plan to grant police officers the right to strike are other issues that could thwart his ambitions to enter a government coalition, however.Chega ran its campaign largely on an anti-corruption platform. Graft scandals triggered the early election after former Socialist leader António Costa resigned in November after eight years as prime minister amid a corruption investigation involving his chief of staff. Costa hasn’t been accused of any crime.That episode appeared to have hurt the Socialists at the ballot box.Public frustration with politics-as-usual had already been percolating before the outcries over graft. Low wages and a high cost of living — worsened last year by surges in inflation and interest rates — coupled with a housing crisis and failings in public health care contributed to the disgruntlement.",[]

Francis recently said the Vatican has launched a behind-the-scenes initiative to try to end the war Russia-Ukraine war.Vatican News via APErdogan made the fresh offer after a meeting in Istanbul with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy has said while he wants peace he will not give up any territory.The Ukrainian leader’s own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv.A spokesman for Zelenskyy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope’s remarks.In the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimize actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term “white flag” in the question.“It is one interpretation, that is true,” Francis said, according to an advance transcript of the interview and a partial video made available to Reuters on Saturday. It is due to be broadcast on March 20 as part of a new cultural program.“But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers.“The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,” Francis said.It was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms such as “white flag” or “defeated” in discussing the Ukraine war, although he has spoken in the past about the need for negotiations.In a statement, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pope had picked up on the term “white flag” spoken by the interviewer and used it “to indicate a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations.”Last year the 87-year-old pope sent a peace envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington to sound out leaders in those countries.“One may feel shame,” Francis said about negotiating, “but how many dead will it (the war) end up with? (One should) negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator,” Francis said, mentioning Turkey among the countries that had offered.“Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse,” said Francis, who has made hundreds of appeals for what he calls “martyred Ukraine.” Asked if he was willing to mediate, Francis said “I am here.”In another part of the interview, speaking of the war between Israel and Hamas, Francis said: “Negotiating is never a surrender.”Last month Zelenskyy said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the Russian invasion in February 2022 and that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in the occupied areas of the country.CORRECTION (March 10, 2024, 5:45 p.m. ET): A photo caption in a previous version of this article misstated when Russia invaded Ukraine.

He has also forged close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden was sharply critical of Trump's meeting with Orbán during remarks at a campaign reception in Pennsylvania where he hammered home his message that the November election is about freedom and democracy.“You know who he’s meeting with today and — down in Mar-a-Lago? Orbán of Hungary, who stated flatly he doesn’t think democracy works,” Biden said.“I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it,” he added.Orbán, who has been prime minister since 2010, posted videos on his Instagram account Friday where he appeared with Trump and former first lady Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago.A day earlier, Orbán visited the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, for an event that was closed to the press. In a post to X after his appearance there, he wrote: “Supporting families, fighting illegal migration and standing up for the sovereignty of our nations. This is the common ground for cooperation between the conservative forces of Europe and the U.S.”Skeptical of sending weapons to Ukraine, vehemently anti-immigrant and hostile to what he calls “woke” culture and LGBTQ rights, Orbán is a darling of many pro-Trump Republicans who see his government as a model of Christian nationalism.Orbán “is exactly the kind of strong leader Trump has an affinity for,” Karen Donfried, who served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs in the Biden administration and is now a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told NBC News.It is highly unusual, she noted, for a visiting head of state to travel to the U.S. and meet with a political opponent of the president without also meeting top officials at the White House.With a possible Trump victory in November, Donfried said Orbán is keen “to strengthen a relationship that already is quite good.”Trump last month posted a clip on his Truth Social platform that featured Orbán praising him during the Hungarian leader's “State of the Nation” address and detailing a desire for Trump to return to the White House. In 2022, Trump endorsed Orbán months before he was re-elected to a fourth term.",[]

Waiting any longer could push passage of critical aid for Ukraine into April, given a planned two-week congressional recess at the end of March, two sources said.Among the proposals being floated is treating some of the nonmilitary aid as a type of loan, said House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, who is involved in the discussions, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Economic aid to support the general function of Ukraine’s government and its long-term rebuilding efforts would be subject to a loan under this plan. Russian assets seized by the U.S. government through sanctions could also be used as collateral for loans to the Ukrainians, McCaul said, adding that the plan could also have a generous repayment system to help Ukraine.Offering up loans as part of the package is designed to help ease the concerns of House conservatives who have criticized billions in U.S. aid for Ukraine and said they will not support sending further U.S. taxpayer dollars without a long-term plan to win the war.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., expressed only modest interest in the new proposal Friday, saying, “We’ve been having a lot of conversations about how to resolve the differences” on Ukraine.McCaul said the proposal would make Russia at least partially responsible for paying for Ukraine to rebuild.“We’re looking at two factors. One is my REPO Act, which will allow us to attach assets related to the Russian sovereign assets that have been sanctioned to help pay for Russia’s war crimes. That’s a very popular idea in the House,” McCaul said. “And secondly, the loan program. … At the end of the day, the Russian sovereign assets would pay for that or they would just default.”The Democratic-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly passed its version of the REPO Act at the end of January but leadership has not put the bill on the Senate floor because it could destroy a sense of urgency to get Ukraine the aid it needs to turn the tide of the war, a senior Democratic aide told NBC News. The House has not taken up the bill yet either.Graham endorsed the loan idea in an interview last week, crediting former President Donald Trump with coming up with it. Trump posted on his Truth Social site on Feb. 10 that Congress should not provide aid money to any country “unless it is done as a loan.”Graham, who once espoused unconditional support for Ukraine, helped to kill a Ukraine aid and border package in the Senate earlier this year that he helped to negotiate, saying that Trump opposed it and preferred a loan structure.“I think President Trump when he mentioned a couple of weeks ago that let’s make this stuff a loan, resonates with the taxpayer,” Graham said last week. “And I think it will make it unlock the House. … You may have to add a little more humanitarian aid to get Democrats, but turn it into a loan and maybe we get this thing done.”Asked about the loan idea last month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that there “can be a place for loans in foreign assistance,” but suggested that Ukraine isn’t one of them. “When you’re dealing with a country that is fighting for its life, like Ukraine … talking about loans as opposed to providing the necessary infusion of cash is only going to make the economic problems of that country worse,” he said, adding that a stable Ukraine “is in the fundamental national security interest of the United States.”A U.S. official familiar with White House’s position told NBC News Friday that some “aid is better than no aid, but this is not an ideal way of doing it. ... Asking a country to take on tens of millions of dollars of debt that they can’t afford to pay off is a recipe for a significant burden, will hurt Ukraine long term and could lead to economic crises down the road.”The foreign aid and border package that passed the Senate last month is “still the best path forward,” the official said, noting that Johnson was briefed by the CIA director last week “and is well aware of how dire the situation is in Ukraine right now and how bleak the country’s options are to continue defending itself.”Johnson has not yet made a final determination on how the House will proceed after rejecting the Senate-passed aid package last month.McCaul is insistent that work on a new Ukraine aid package begin soon, suggesting the House would write its own bill and send that back to the Senate. “We’re not interested in a pingpong match. We want to have a bill that’s solid that we can pass here, and I believe we can, and send it over to the Senate and go to the White House,” he said. “This is urgent in Ukraine. We can’t waste any more time.”One consideration for Johnson, two sources said, is that if the House punts the foreign aid bill to April, Republicans will have rounded the corner on several key primaries, which could free up additional GOP support for funding to Ukraine, said two officials with knowledge of discussions.Meanwhile, as NBC News reported last month, the Pentagon is weighing giving Ukraine urgent weapons without waiting for Congress to approve funds. The lion’s share of assistance for Ukraine comes in the form of weapons pulled from the U.S. supply; the nonmilitary aid that could be subject to a loan is just a small slice of U.S. aid to the country.And other supporters of Ukraine in the House have prepped long-shot bids to try to force the aid money through.House Democrats have prepared a discharge petition, a procedural mechanism to force a vote on a piece of legislation essentially over the speaker’s head, to try to pass the Senate immigration and foreign aid bill. But they would need 218 signatures to force that vote, and that means getting several Republicans to join their efforts.Separately, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Jared Golden, D-Maine, authored their own foreign aid package that offers less funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan than the Senate bill. It also includes some provisions to reduce the number of migrant crossings at the southern border. Fitzpatrick said he has personally spoken to both Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., about a way to bring the bill to the floor for a vote and he’s preparing his own discharge petition as a backstop to apply pressure to get a vote.Those efforts appear to be making no headway, however. On Friday, when Scalise was asked if there would be any consideration of Fitzpatrick’s bill, he responded with a firm, “No.” And Jeffries repeated his insistence that the Senate foreign aid bill is “the only way forward” in the House because it would get bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans — a necessary ingredient given the dozens of House Republicans opposed to continuing to fund Ukraine’s war.",[]

The Orthodox Church, which believes homosexuality is a sin, is vehemently opposed. The first gay wedding took place in Athens last week under police watch after the couple received threats.Many in the LGBTQ community believe the law does not go far enough. It does not allow LGBTQ couples to use assisted reproduction methods. Surrogate pregnancies will also not be extended to LGBTQ individuals.Still, mayor Doukas said progress has been made.“It is our duty to safeguard that every citizen of Athens has the freedom and the right to live and love as they desire,” he told Reuters after the ceremony.Beziki and Deligeorges were overjoyed.

Applause filled the cobblestoned Place Vendome as France became the first country to explicitly guarantee abortion rights in its national charter.The measure was overwhelmingly approved by French lawmakers earlier this week, and Friday’s ceremony means it can now enter into force.While abortion is a deeply divisive issue in the United States, it’s legal in nearly all of Europe and overwhelmingly supported in France, where it’s seen more as a question of public health rather than politics. French legislators approved the constitutional amendment on Monday in a 780-72 vote that was backed by many far-right lawmakers.Friday’s ceremony in Paris was a key event on a day focused on advancing women’s rights globally. Marches, protests and conferences are being held from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Mexico City and beyond.The French constitutional amendment has been hailed by women’s rights advocates around the world, including places where women struggle to access birth control or maternal health care. French President Emmanuel Macron called it a direct result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 rescinding long-held abortion rights.Macron’s critics questioned why he pursued the measure in a country with no obvious threat to abortion rights but where women face a multitude of other problems.While some French women saw the step as a major win, others said that in reality not every French woman has access to abortion.“It’s a smokescreen,” Arya Meroni, 32, said of the event.“The government is destroying our health care system, many family planning clinics have closed,’’ she said at an annual “Feminist Night March” in Paris on the eve of International Women’s Day.France has a persistently high rate of women killed by their partners and challenges remain in prosecuting sexual abuse against women by powerful celebrities and other men. French women also see lower pay and pensions — especially women who are not white.Macron’s government said the abortion amendment was important to avoid a U.S.-like scenario for women in France, as hard-right groups are gaining ground and seeking to turn back the clock on freedoms around Europe.Macron will preside over the constitutional ceremony. Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti will use a 100-kilogram (220-pound) press from 1810 to imprint the amendment in France’s 1958 constitution.It will include the phrase, “the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.” The ceremony will be held outdoors with the public invited, in another first.France follows in the footsteps of the former Yugoslavia, whose 1974 constitution included the phrase: “A person is free to decide on having children.” Yugoslavia’s successor states retained similar language in their constitutions, though they did not spell out guaranteed abortion rights.Not everyone saw the day as a cause for celebration, as angry protest marches were held in numerous countries.The head of the Danish Trade Union Confederation, which has 1.3 million members, chafed at how differently women and men are treated in some areas.“Unfortunately, we still see sky-high pay differences, professions dominated by one sex, a gender-segregated labor market, harassment cases that primarily affect women and a wide range of other equality problems,” Morten Skov Christensen said.In other events Friday:In Ireland, voters will decide whether to change the constitution to remove passages referring to women’s domestic duties and broadening the definition of the family.At street rallies in Seoul, participants had an eye on next month’s parliamentary elections in South Korea and expressed hope that parties would prioritize gender equality.In Russia, where the United Nations says human rights have deteriorated since the military’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin saluted Russian women fighting in the war and those waiting at home for their loved ones who had been deployed.Protesters in Istanbul plan to call attention to violence against women, and rallies are expected in many cities. Protests in Turkey are often political and, at times, violent, rooted in women’s efforts to improve their rights as workers. This year’s global theme is “Inspire Inclusion.”Indonesian demonstrators demanded adoption of the International Labor Organization’s conventions concerning gender equality and eliminating workplace violence and harassment. Labor rights groups in Thailand marched to the Government House to petition for better work conditions, and activists marching against violence in the Philippine capital were stopped by police near the presidential palace, sparking a brief scuffle.India’s government cut the price of cooking gas cylinders by 100 rupees ($1.20) with Prime Minister Narendra Modi posting on social media that the move was “in line with our commitment to empowering women.”The United Nations children’s agency said in a report released on International Women’s Day that more than 230 million women and girls around the world have undergone female genital mutilation. The number has increased by 30 million in the past eight years, it said.“We’re also seeing a worrying trend that more girls are subjected to the practice at younger ages, many before their fifth birthday. That further reduces the window to intervene,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.Officially recognized by the United Nations in 1977, International Women’s Day is a national holiday in about 20 countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Afghanistan.",[]

It is also a blow for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought prevent any further strengthening of the alliance.Sweden will benefit from the alliance’s common defense guarantee under which an attack on one member is regarded as an attack on all.“Sweden is a safer country today than we were yesterday. We have allies. We have backing,” Kristersson said in an address to the Swedish nation from Washington. “We have taken out an insurance in the Western defense alliance.”Hakan Yucel, 54, an IT worker in the Swedish capital, said of the accession: “Before, we were outside and felt a little bit alone. ... I think that the threat from Russia, it’s going to be much less now.”President Joe Biden, in a statement, said the addition of Sweden made NATO “more united, determined, and dynamic than ever,” adding that the accession of Sweden and Finland to the alliance meant the addition of “two highly capable militaries.”Sweden adds cutting-edge submarines and a sizable fleet of domestically produced Gripen fighter jets to NATO forces, and is a crucial link between the Atlantic and Baltic.“Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer and the whole Alliance more secure,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.Russia has threatened to take unspecified “political and military-technical counter-measures” in response to Sweden’s move.“Joining NATO is really like buying insurance, at least as long as the United States is actually willing to be the insurance provider,” said Barbara Kunz, a researcher at defense think tank SIPRI.While Stockholm has been drawing ever closer to NATO over the last two decades, membership marks a clear break with the past, when for more than 200 years, Sweden avoided military alliances and adopted a neutral stance in times of war.After World War Two, it built an international reputation as a champion of human rights, and since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, successive governments have pared back military spending.As recently as 2021, its defense minister had rejected NATO membership, only for the then-Social Democrat government to apply, alongside neighbor Finland, just a few months later.“I guess (Sweden) had to take a stance really and I’m happy that we actually did and that we are safeguarded by NATO, because the tension with Russia has been growing for a couple of years,” said Carl Fredrik Aspegren, 28, a student in Stockholm.While Finland joined the alliance last year, Sweden was kept waiting as Turkey and Hungary, which both have cordial relations with Russia, delayed ratifying Sweden’s accession.Turkey approved Sweden’s application in January.Hungary delayed its decision on Sweden’s accession until Kristersson made a goodwill visit to Budapest on Feb. 23, where the two countries agreed a fighter jet deal.",[]

Also falling victim are independent voices as well as those who don’t conform to what the state sees as the country’s “traditional values.”Russia’s once-thriving free press after the collapse of the Soviet Union has been largely reduced to either state-controlled media or independent journalists operating from abroad, with few critical outlets still working in the country. Prominent rights groups have been outlawed or classified as agents of foreigners. Lawyers who represented dissidents have been prosecuted. LGBTQ activists have been labeled “extremists.”A look at those who have come under attack during Putin’s 24-year rule that is likely to be extended by six more years in this month’s presidential election:Independent mediaIndependent news sites largely have been blocked in Russia since the first weeks of the war in Ukraine. Many have moved their newsrooms abroad and continue to operate, accessible in Russia via virtual private networks, or VPNs. Reporting inside Russia or earning money off Russian advertisers has been difficult.Russian authorities since 2021 also have labeled dozens of outlets and individual journalists as ”foreign agents” — a designation implying additional government scrutiny and carrying strong pejorative connotations aimed at discrediting the recipient. Some have also been outlawed as “undesirable organizations” under a 2015 law that makes involvement with such organizations a criminal offense.Journalists have been arrested and imprisoned on a variety of charges.“The Russian authorities decided to destroy civil society institutions and independent journalism completely after Feb. 24, 2022,” said Ivan Kolpakov, chief editor of Russia’s most popular independent news site Meduza, referring to the date of the invasion. Meduza was declared “undesirable” in January 2023.More restrictions appear to be coming. Parliament passed a law banning advertisers from doing business with “foreign agents,” likely affecting not just news sites but also blogs on YouTube that need advertising and are a popular source of news and analysis.Journalist Katerina Gordeyeva initially said she was suspending her YouTube channel with 1.6 million subscribers due to the new law but changed her mind after an outpouring of support. “Giving up now would be too simple and too easy a decision,” she said. “We will try to hang in there.”Rights groupsDozens of rights groups, charities and other nongovernmental organizations have been labeled “foreign agents” and outlawed as “undesirable” in recent years. Many had to shut down.In December 2021, a court in Moscow ordered the closure of Memorial, one of Russia’s oldest and most prominent human rights organizations. It drew international acclaim for its studies of repression in the Soviet Union; several months after the ruling, it won the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. In yet another crippling blow, its 70-year-old co-chair, Oleg Orlov, was sentenced last month to 2½ years in prison over criticism of the war.Another prominent rights group leader behind bars is Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of Golos, which monitored Russian elections since 2000. He is in pre-trial detention on charges widely seen as an attempt to pressure the group ahead of this month’s vote.His arrest last year wasn’t a surprise, said the group’s other leader, Stanislav Andreychuk, in an interview with The Associated Press, because Golos has been under pressure since it detailed widespread violations in the 2011 parliamentary election that led to mass protests.Pressure against Golos came in waves, however, and at times, the group was able to work constructively with election authorities. It even won two presidential grants.“We are like a town on a high river bank,” Andriychuk said. “The river eats away at the bank, and the bank recedes slowly. … At some point, we found ourselves on the cliffside.”LawyersLawyers who represent Kremlin critics and work on politically motivated cases also have faced growing pressure. Some prominent ones have left Russia, fearing prosecution.Human rights and legal aid group Agora was labeled “undesirable” in 2023, making its operations and any dealings with it illegal.Three lawyers who represented Alexei Navalny are jailed on charges of involvement with an extremist organization. Associates of the late opposition leader said it was a way to isolate him while in prison.Prominent human rights lawyer Ivan Pavlov told AP the pressure has scared some attorneys away from political cases. Pavlov left Russia in 2021 while defending former journalist Ivan Safronov on treason charges. After Pavlov spoke out about the case, authorities opened a criminal investigation against him and barred him from using the phone and the internet. “They simply paralyzed my work,” he said.Dmitry Talantov, another lawyer for Safronov, was arrested in 2022 for criticizing the war and is on trial. He faces up to 10 years in prison.LGBTQ communityThe crackdown on LGBTQ rights has gone on for more than a decade and often was accompanied by Putin’s criticism of Western nations trying to impose their values on Russia. In 2022, authorities adopted a law banning propaganda of “nontraditional sexual relations” among adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ rights.Another law enacted in 2023 prohibited gender transitioning procedures and gender- affirming care, as well as changing a person’s gender in official documents and public records.In November, the Supreme Court banned what the government called the LGBTQ “movement” in Russia, labeling it as an extremist organization. That effectively outlawed any LGBTQ activism. Shortly afterward, authorities started imposing fines for displaying rainbow-colored items.Igor Kochetkov, human rights advocate and founder of the Russian LGBT Network, told AP the Supreme Court ruling was more about ideology than anything else.“So far we haven’t seen attempts to ban gay relations” and criminalize them, as the Soviet Union did, Kochetkov said. Rather, it’s an attempt to suppress “any independent opinion that doesn’t fit with the official state ideology ... and any organized civic activity that the government can’t control,” he added.Religious believersIn perhaps a similar vein, the government, closely allied with the Russian Orthodox Church, has cracked down on smaller religious denominations and groups, banning some. Authorities went further with Jehovah’s Witnesses, prosecuting hundreds of believers across the country, often simply for gathering to pray.The Supreme Court in 2017 declared Jehovah’s Witnesses to be an extremist organization, exposing those involved with it to potential criminal charges.Jehovah’s Witnesses spokesman Jarrod Lopes said over 400 believers have been jailed since then, and 131 men and women are in prison. Nearly 800 Jehovah’s Witnesses have faced charges, and over 500 were added to Russia’s register of extremists and terrorists.“It’s absurd to us, because … part of our belief system is to obey the authorities. We want to be good citizens. We want to help our community,” he told AP. “We’re also not anti-government, we are neutral. We’re not going to stage a protest.”In 2018, Putin himself said “Jehovah’s Witnesses are Christians, too, I don’t quite understand why clamp down on them,” and he promised to look into it. But the number of arrests and raids targeting them only grew.Putin has distanced himself from the law enforcement and security structures that carry out the crackdowns, says Tatyana Stanovaya, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.“They have a certain domain, and they have a mandate in this domain, and they act in accordance with it,” Stanovaya says. “Putin knows it and agrees with it. … It’s convenient for him.”",[]

The socially conservative Church of Greece had strongly and volubly opposed the reform proposed by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' center-right government, preaching against it and pressuring lawmakers to reject it.“For us, these two (local) lawmakers cannot consider themselves active members of the Church,” a statement from the bishopric of Corfu said Tuesday.It added that they should be excluded from the key Christian rite of communion, abstain from any Church events and not be accorded formal honors by Church functionaries at official events or parish gatherings.“We exhort them to repent for their impropriety,” the statement added.The bishopric proceeded to commend another local lawmaker from Mitsotakis’ governing New Democracy party for voting against the law.“That is the kind of politician, irrespective of other convictions, that we need in our country,” it said.The Corfu bishopric’s statement followed a similar move last month from Church officials in Piraeus, the port of Athens, targeting local lawmakers who voted to legalize same-sex marriage.The left-wing PASOK party, one of whose lawmakers was targeted Tuesday, said the Corfu bishopric’s decision was “unacceptable.”Beyond legalizing marriage, the law also confered full parental rights on married same-sex partners with children. But it precluded gay couples from parenthood through surrogate mothers in Greece — an option currently available to women who can’t have children for health reasons.It was approved despite opposition from a minority of lawmakers from New Democracy’s right wing, who either voted against it abstained from the ballot — as did several left-wing opposition lawmakers.Prime Minister Mitsotakis personally championed the reform, which was backed by a narrow majority of the population, according to opinion polls.Greek media reported that the first same-sex wedding under the new law was held over the weekend in southern Athens.Church officials focus their criticism on the law’s implications for traditional family values.

Such an event attracted high-ranking European military officials, making it a target for Russian security services.“So we must assume that the access to this Webex conference was a chance hit in the framework of a broad, scattered approach.”The use of Webex for calls up to a certain security grade was authorized, he said, noting it was not the off-the-shelf software but a specially-certified one with servers in the Bundeswehr’s computing centres in Germany.Still, Germany was investigating if issues were mentioned on the call that should not have been discussed on Webex, he said.Pistorius said Russia had leaked the call in a bid to create divisions in Germany and between the country and its allies.In the call, German Air Force Chief Ingo Gerhartz discusses with three high-ranking Luftwaffe officials the possible delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv, which Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly so far firmly rejected, fueling a public debate.Asked if the leak could affect the position of Gerhartz, who was not the one to dial in from Singapore, Pistorius said if nothing further emerged in the probe, “then I am not going to sacrifice one of my best officers to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s games.”Germany would take technical and organizational measures to ensure such an incident would not happen again, Pistorius said,adding he had spoken on Monday with his peers in partner countries who expressed their continued trust in Germany.“Everyone knows about the danger of such eavesdropping attacks and know that you cannot ensure 100% protection against them,” he said.Germany’s allies have been reticent in their public reaction to the recording although some British politicians outside government criticised German security measures.Former British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was quoted as saying by The Times that the incident demonstrated Germany was “neither secure nor reliable”.The Kremlin says the recording shows Germany’s armed forces were discussing plans to launch strikes on Russian territory, charges Germany denies as “absurd.”",[]

In the early months of the war, Ukraine sank the flagship Moskva with hundreds of crew on board. More recently, Kyiv has deployed its own uncrewed sea drones laden with explosives to threaten Russian vessels.The attacks around Crimea have helped push Moscow’s naval forces back to their own Black Sea ports, allowing Kyiv more freedom of navigation and control of an area crucial to exporting grain.Just last month, Ukraine claimed it sank the Caesar Kunikov landing ship off the coast of Crimea. Two weeks before that, its military intelligence claimed to have sunk the corvette Ivanovets, also off the peninsula’s coast.

The leak has caused uproar in Berlin, possible harm to its support for Ukraine and accusations that this is all part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s yearslong “information war” against the West.Germany on Monday dismissed the Kremlin’s claims that the recording — which included discussions of how Ukraine might use German weapons against Russian forces and potential strikes by Kyiv on a key bridge in occupied Crimea — betrayed plans to go to war directly with Russia. Berlin has not denied the authenticity of the leaked call, instead promising a quick investigation into how such a high-level conversation was apparently intercepted by Moscow. It’s the latest sign that Putin is exploiting divisions within NATO as the transatlantic alliance grapples with the prospect of a second Trump presidency and waning support for Ukraine. “Another word for information war is propaganda,” said Frank Ledwidge, a former British military intelligence officer and senior lecturer in war studies at England’s University of Portsmouth. “This was a major foul-up, and the Russians are taking advantage of it.”‘Undermining our unity’The 38-minute audio recording was leaked Friday by a leading Russian propagandist, just as the eyes of the West were on the funeral of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow.Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia’s state-run RT network, published the audio of the call, which she said features officers including the head of Germany’s air force talking about the use of Taurus long-range cruise missiles, and potential strikes against the Kerch Bridge, Putin’s pet project connecting the annexed Crimean Peninsula to Russia. The use of the German-made missiles could require the presence of German troops on the ground to help deploy them, the officers reportedly said, a red line that Berlin has been wary of crossing. Germany is now the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the U.S., but has drawn growing criticism for its reluctance to grant Kyiv’s wish for supplies of longer-range weapons like the Taurus, which would help Ukraine strike deeper inside Russian territory. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated his opposition to supplying the weapons last week, citing a desire to avoid being drawn directly into the conflict.But the Kremlin quickly accused Germany of planning just that as it seized on the revelations with glee. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the leak was proof that “plans to launch strikes on Russian territory are being substantively and specifically discussed” within the German army. It shows, he said, the “direct involvement” of the West in the war in Ukraine — part of the Kremlin’s long-standing narrative framing the invasion of its neighbor as an existential fight for Russia’s survival.Russian state media reported that Germany’s ambassador had been summoned by the Russian  Foreign Ministry, although Berlin said it was a preplanned meeting. A spokesperson for the German government, Wolfgang Buechner, said that any suggestions that the country was preparing to enter a war with Russia were “absurd, malicious Russian propaganda.”The leak was “part of an information war that Putin is waging,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Sunday. “It is a hybrid attack aimed at disinformation. It’s about division, it’s about undermining our unity.”",[]

A criminal case has been launched against her, the FSB said, and she is facing charges of treason, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.  Pervy Otdel, a Russian lawyers group, said it had information that Karelina had donated just over $51.80 from her U.S. bank account on Feb. 24, 2022 — the day that Russia launched what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine — to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine. Authorities have not confirmed that, and NBC News was not able to independently verify the sum or the nature of the alleged donation.Van Heerden, who said he has known Karelina for four years, said he couldn’t “wrap my head around” the idea that she had been arrested for donating such a small amount. He added that he had made plenty of donations to various causes “without even thinking what I’m doing.”“Fifty-one dollars, come on,” he said, adding that Karelina had made “a simple donation because she’s kind.”Van Heerden said he had received a “love letter” from her after she was detained.He said the former ballerina-turned-aesthetician had described her new life behind bars, including 6 a.m. wake-up calls for someone who is “not a morning person.”“They got to go to bed at 10 and they get to shower once a week, which is painful,” he said. “They get a book once a week to read.” While prisoners were allowed out once a day for a bit of fresh air, he said it was snowing and “cold out there.” He added that sometimes the guards left them outside for hours.She also wrote something “beautiful,” he said. “She said, ‘I’ve got a little window in my cell and I can see the sun and I know that I look at the same sun as you look at when the sun goes down,’” Van Heerden added.He also spoke of his guilt because he had paid for her plane ticket to Russia. Visiting had not been an option since before the Covid-19 pandemic, and she wanted to see her 90-year-old grandparents, he said. “She’s afraid that she won’t see them,” he added.Although she had encouraged him to join her, he said he would meet her in the middle and they would spend New Year’s together in Istanbul. “We had a magical time,” he said, adding that she was “excited to go home.”If he hadn’t bought the ticket, he reasoned, she would have found another way to go.“I was actually thinking of proposing to this woman, so every day is tough,” he said, adding: “She’s got an affectionate smile. Always happy, so, so, so giving. She lives a full life.”In an earlier interview with NBC Los Angeles, Van Heerden said Karelina faced problems from the moment she arrived, and was detained at the airport. She was eventually released, although authorities kept her mobile phone, Van Heerden said. They used her mother’s phone to communicate in the meantime, he said, but on Jan. 27 she said she was going to pick up her phone, and it was the last time they spoke.Karelina’s detention is part of a long-standing trend of Russian authorities detaining foreign citizens and Russian citizens who have citizenship in another country. Two journalists with American citizenship are currently in Russian custody. In the most recent case, in January, U.S. national Robert Romanov Woodland was arrested and detained in Russia on drug trafficking charges.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said last week that diplomats in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow were working to learn more and gain access to Karelina. But he made clear that Russia does not officially recognize any dual U.S.-Russian national’s American citizenship.In the meantime, Van Heerden said he was doing everything in his power to secure her release and had petitioned the White House and lawmakers about her case.While he said he was trying to live his own life as best as possible, he was trying to remain positive that Karelina would be released.“I am now more hopeful than ever,” he said.",[]

But since its inception in 1956, the organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest have strived to keep pop and politics apart. This year, that might once again prove difficult.Although the grand final in Malmo, Sweden, is months away, Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza looms over the competition, which is best known for its wild outfits and a smorgasbord of musical genres.When Iceland chooses its entry on Saturday, among the hopefuls will be Bashar Murad, a Palestinian singer from East Jerusalem.If he is selected to represent the volcanic hot spot in the final, he will not be breaking any rules, as singers do not have to be from the country they’re representing. American rapper Flo Rida, for example, performed as part of the San Marino entry in 2021.Murad told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday that he was inspired to enter after he “remembered that Celine Dion had participated for Switzerland even though she’s not from there.”The Canadian superstar won the competition in 1988 with her song “Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi.”Palestinian singer Bashar Murad in Ramallah, occupied West Bank, on April 6, 2019.David Corio / Redferns via Getty ImagesFirst Murad will have to win Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic competition to select the country’s representative for the Eurovision finals.To compete however, he’s had to learn how to sing his song in the language, something he said he’s worked hard to get right.He said his song “Wild West,” which he performs in a white suit with a broken-heart emoji on his chest, is about following your dreams and “not letting physical or imaginary borders confine you or define you.”“I was just walking the streets of Jerusalem and like listening to the song on repeat, and making sure I nailed all the pronunciation,” he said. “It is a difficult language, but it’s also a very beautiful one.”Murad said he could understand why people might think his decision to enter was political, but he insisted it wasn’t, because he was “telling my personal story and my personal experience, and it just happens to be politicized.”Simply telling people “that you’re Palestinian, people will just say that you’re making things political,” he added.Founded in 1956 to help unite a continent scarred by World War II, Eurovision has grown to include 37 countries, including non-European nations like Australia and Israel.The European Broadcasting Union, which runs Eurovision, strives to keep pop and politics apart — banning overtly political symbols and lyrics — but global tensions have often imposed themselves on the contest.Ukraine won the contest in 2016 with a song about the expulsion of Crimean Tatars by the Soviet Union’s forces in the 1940s. Coming on the heels of the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the song proved controversial. Ukraine triumphed again in 2022, shortly after President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the country.Jamala, representing Ukraine, wins the grand final of the 61st annual Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm on May 14, 2016.Britta Pedersen / picture-alliance via APRussia, long a powerhouse in Eurovision, was kicked out of the competition after the invasion.Catherine Baker, a senior lecturer in 20th-century history at Britain’s University of Hull, said the EBU’s insistence that songs were not political was part of what allowed it to function.“In order for an international competition to work, every participant has to be able to trust every other participant plus the organizer,” said Baker, who has studied the Eurovision Song Contest. “So if there was not that kind of rule in it, in the contemporary world, would an international competition based on music and cultural expression even be able to exist?”Following the launch of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, several high-profile artists including Robyn and former Eurovision competitor Malena Ernman, the opera singer and mother of climate activist Greta Thunberg, called for the country to be kicked out of the contest like Russia was, which the EBU has rejected.After reports in Israeli media last month that the country’s entry referenced Oct. 7 — the day Hamas launched multipronged attacks on Israel — the EBU said in a statement that it was “scrutinizing” the lyrics of Eden Golan’s song “October Rain.”Israeli Culture Minister Miki Zohar described the controversy as “outrageous” in a post on X. Calling the song moving, he said it “expresses the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political.”Tal Dorot, vice president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE Israel, said he hoped a “way to bridge the gaps” could be found.Politics were inevitably going to be present, he said, because “it’s a competition between countries. You can’t have politics completely out of it.” But, he added, “I think we should try to keep it as apolitical as possible and focus on the music and the performances.”In the meantime, Murad hopes to emulate last year’s winner, Swedish singer Loreen, who won with her power ballad “Tattoo,” and use the Eurovision stage as a chance to step into the spotlight.After growing up watching pop stars like Britney Spears, Madonna,  Lady Gaga and Freddie Mercury, he said it had “always been my dream to make it on an international, global level.”He also hopes to send a message to viewers at home: “I am a Palestinian and it is the skin I’m in, and it’s also the lens through which I see the world. And I hope that people just see that through my performance, that we all have a beating heart, hopes, dreams and ambitions.”",[]

He spoke for more than two hours to Russia's Federal Assembly at Moscow's vast and grand Gostiny Dvor conference center, a stone's throw from the Kremlin, surrounded by typically tight security with the surrounding streets cordoned off.Putin covered an array of topics, from Russia's low birthrate to its need for better broadband coverage. But top of the agenda was his warning against deepening Western involvement in Ukraine.His comments came after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested this week that NATO allies could send troops to Ukraine in the future, rather than just funding and arming the country indirectly. Macron’s suggestion was swiftly rejected by the United States and others, but Putin said that such a development would risk a wider war with potentially apocalyptic consequences.“This is very dangerous because it could actually trigger the use of nuclear weapons,” he said. “Do they not understand that?”He said his strategic nuclear forces were at ""full readiness"" and suggested that a hypersonic nuclear weapon he first mentioned in 2018 was approaching a full state of readiness — a claim that cannot be verified. A spokesperson for the National Security Council told NBC News that “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is reckless and irresponsible. We will continue to support Ukraine as they defend themselves from Russian aggression.” “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” the spokesperson added. The NSC reiterated Tuesday that the U.S. will not send troops to fight in Ukraine.Putin also denied U.S. intelligence that said Russia was developing a space-based nuclear weapon designed to target American satellites.The idea that Russia is ""preparing to launch a nuclear attack in space"" was ""just a lie to make us look bad,"" he said.Putin spoke for more than two hours to an audience of lawmakers and top officials.Alexander Nemenov / AFP - Getty ImagesPutin has often made such threats over the past two years since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But this week’s warning was, in the eyes of some observers, his most pointed to date.Putin’s annual address comes at a crucial moment for the Kremlin, with its forces advancing in Ukraine ahead of an election that will reinforce his rule. The death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and a slew of domestic issues have fueled criticism at home and abroad, but Putin will be boosted by growing signs of wavering Western support for Kyiv.On Monday, Macron caused a stir by suggesting that the West “should not exclude” the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine. This would be a huge practical and symbolic step for allied support of Kyiv, which has so far extended to providing billions of dollars for its defense but has deliberately stopped short of sending forces for fear of starting a direct war with nuclear-armed Russia.The U.S. and others quickly poured cold water on the idea, with the White House saying that it had “been clear that the U.S. will not send troops to fight in Ukraine.” Mark Galeotti, head of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence and an honorary professor at University College London, said Macron had handed Putin a “propaganda gift” because it boosted his narrative that Moscow is fighting the West at large, rather than just Ukraine.During Putin’s speech, “his reference to potential NATO deployments to Ukraine was less, in my opinion, about warning off the West so much as using it to reinforce his message that this is a struggle against the whole collective West,” Galeotti told NBC News. “Macron gave him something of a propaganda gift.”",[]

Navalny’s team encouraged people to do so anyway, despite not having a central venue.Russia, which has become increasingly repressive under Putin’s rule, suppressing free speech and political opposition, already faces a surge of support for Navalny since he died in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16 at age 47. Tributes to Alexei Navalny are laid in Amsterdam this week.Paulo Amorim / Sipa USA via APHundreds were arrested after his death as people with flowers and candles streamed to ad hoc memorials, as well as monuments to other victims of political repression, rights groups said.

The Kremlin has denied the accusation of poisoning.“Putin killed my husband, Alexei Navalny,” Navalnaya said in her speech to European lawmakers, which was punctuated by regular applause and ended with a prolonged standing ovation. On Putin’s orders, “Alexei was tortured for three years, he was starved in a tiny stone cell, cut off from the outside world and denied visits, phone calls and then even letters — and then they killed him,” she said.Even after his death, “they abused his body and abused his mother,” Navalnaya said, in an apparent reference to claims by her mother-in-law, Lyudmila Navalnaya, 69, that officials had tried to blackmail her by insisting on a quiet, nonpublic funeral while holding the body for so long that it started to decompose.Her husband’s death showed “Putin is capable of anything and you cannot negotiate with him,” Navalnaya said.Russian police on Wednesday guard the Borisov cemetery on the outskirts of Moscow, where Alexei Navalny is expected to be buried this week.Getty ImagesHours before Navalnaya spoke, Zhdanov, the director of Navalny’s foundation, posted a message to social media giving details of what he said were attempts to thwart the funeral plans. He said his team could not find anywhere to host the funeral and bury Navalny on Thursday, when Putin is due to deliver his annual address to Russia’s parliament, the Federal Assembly.“The Kremlin understands that, on the day of farewell with Alexei, no one will be interested in Putin and his address,” Zhdanov wrote. “We don’t care about the address. Alexei needs to be buried.”Zhdanov said that his team did manage to find a church and a cemetery on Friday but that its attempts to find a large hall have been unsuccessful.“They again put forward the condition of ‘a quiet family funeral with farewell at the Khovanskoye cemetery,’” Zhdanov said, referring to a cemetery outside Moscow. He did not specify who made the demand. “In general, there will be no hall,” he said, adding: “They don’t give a date. They don’t provide a hall.” He encouraged supporters to “say goodbye to Alexei anyway.”People lay flowers at a makeshift memorial to Alexei Navalny in Moscow on Feb. 17.Alexander Zemlianichenko / APRussian officials, as well as Ritual, the state company that has a monopoly on funeral services, have been asked for comment.Russian authorities reported that Navalny, who had survived at least one previous poisoning attempt, died in custody at a Siberian prison. According to the Russian Prison Service, he fell ill after a walk and almost immediately lost consciousness.He died as a deal to free him was in the works, five sources told NBC News on Tuesday, although the swap was not thought to be imminent when Navalny’s death was announced. Two of the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said the proposed deal would have included the releases of reporter Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan.",[]

No decisions have been made, according to the officials. The discussions reflect growing alarm in the administration that Ukraine is poised to run out of key weaponry in the next few weeks, including 155 mm artillery rounds and air defense munitions.Not all administration officials support the idea of sending a tranche of aid to Ukraine as a stopgap move, however. Some administration and congressional officials are concerned that such a move could imperil White House negotiations with Congress, particularly House Republican leaders, to get roughly $60 billion in new Ukraine aid through the chamber. Other officials are wary of the idea because it could put the U.S. military’s stockpiles below levels that are considered necessary for sufficient readiness.But after months of fiercely protecting stockpiles in the name of military readiness, Pentagon officials are now warming to the idea of accepting some risk to U.S. readiness in order to keep Ukraine in the fight.A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said, ""We are focused on urging the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental package as soon as possible. Ukraine needs the full resources in that package and Speaker Johnson should put it to a vote, where it would overwhelmingly pass, since there is no other way to fully meet Ukraine's needs.""In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson said, “The DoD continues to urge Congress to pass a supplemental to support Ukraine in its time of need and to replenish our stocks.”The House is not expected to move on Ukraine aid until at least late March. But even if that happens, the process is not expected to be swift, given GOP opposition in the House to a Senate bill that passed earlier this month.The Pentagon still has about $4 billion in congressionally approved Presidential Drawdown Authority funding, meaning it can provide $4 billion worth of weapons and equipment from U.S. stockpiles to Ukraine. But the Pentagon does not have enough approved funding available to replace the weapons and equipment after the U.S. sends it. Without funding, Biden administration officials must decide whether the risk of depleting of U.S. stockpiles without guarantees of when they’ll be replenished is a risk worth taking. The idea of providing artillery and ammunition from U.S. stockpiles, even without a supplemental, has been on the table for a few weeks, according to a congressional official, but it is a last resort move when Congress has no more options. The official said that there is momentum now and that if the president approves this now, it could undermine progress that is being made in Congress and damage their argument that the supplemental is critical now.Two congressional officials say the goal is to pass Ukraine funding in the third week of March in order to sustain that country in its war against Russia and they anticipate a vote by the end of March. If the House can’t get the funding passed by then, the administration can take the ammunition from U.S. stockpiles, “but to do it now would absolutely kill us,” one congressional official said.",[]

I am also satisfied that they are in breach of Article 3 of the ECHR,” Judge Adrian Colton told the court.“There is no evidence that the granting of immunity under the Act will in any way contribute to reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary,” Colton said, spending more than two hours reading the 200-page judgment.Britain’s Northern Ireland minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, said that the government remained committed to implementing the law and that the challenge in Belfast was a “complex case” that was likely to lead to further action in higher courts.Victims’ families, human rights organizations and all major political parties in Northern Ireland — both British unionist and Irish nationalist — oppose the law.The Irish government is mounting a separate legal challenge against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights, where it has also argued that the British move was incompatible with its obligations under the European Convention.The judge declared that the immunity provisions were also incompatible with the Windsor Framework agreement governing post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland that London struck with the European Union last year.His ruling added that other sections of the Northern Ireland Troubles Act, including the halting of certain civil actions related to the conflict, were incompatible with both the ECHR and the Windsor Framework.The leader of Northern Ireland’s moderate nationalist SDLP party, Colum Eastwood, called on London to abandon its approach.The more than 20 challenges were condensed down to lead cases that were heard in November. Lawyers for the applicants told the court that victims’ families who had been seeking justice for decades had suffered “a form of secondary trauma.”Britain has defended the law, saying prosecutions linked to the events of up to 55 years ago were increasingly unlikely. A lawyer for the government argued that the law was a “logical outworking” of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and could draw a line under the conflict.Around 3,600 people died in three decades of confrontation between Irish nationalist militants seeking a united Ireland, pro-British “loyalist” paramilitaries and the British military.",[]

Three were related to his security arrangements and three have been against tabloid publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.In his first case to go to trial, Harry won a big victory last year against the publisher of the Daily Mirror over phone hacking allegations, winning a judgment in court and ultimately settling remaining allegations that were due to go to trial. While the settlement was undisclosed, he was to be reimbursed for all his legal fees and was due to receive an interim payment of 400,000 pounds ($505,000).He recently withdrew a libel case against the Daily Mail over an article that said he tried to hide his efforts to continue receiving government-funded security. Harry dropped the case after a judge ruled he was more likely to lose at trial because the publisher could show that statements issued on his behalf were misleading and that the February 2022 article reflected an “honest opinion” and wasn’t libelous.Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London’s police force to guard him when he comes to town. A judge denied that offer after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn’t be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.”",[]

But the debt-stricken island’s president raised doubts over whether his government would go through with the cancellations, which would threaten a much-needed source of tourist income.Russian and Ukrainian tourists must leave Sri Lanka by March 7 after their final free visa extensions expire, according to a notice issued by the Tourism Development Authority. The Immigration Department had said last month that the visas were being extended because of the “non-operation of airlines in the region.”However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered an investigation into the notice, saying the visas could not be canceled without Cabinet approval.“The Govt hasn’t officially decided to revoke visa extensions previously granted to these tourists,” his office said Sunday on X.Facing sweeping travel restrictions after the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, many Russians flocked to Sri Lanka when it offered near-indefinite stays. Russia became Sri Lanka’s largest source of tourists after nearby India last year.Nearly 200,000 Russians and 5,000 Ukrainians visited the country of 22 million last year, official Sri Lankan tourism department data showed.It’s unclear how many remained in the country beyond the usual duration of a tourist visa, which is 30 days. But thousands are believed to have remained — including those seeking to avoid being drafted into the military — and some have set up restaurants and nightclubs.It’s also unclear whether the end of the visa extensions was related to the recent outcry, but one of those nightclubs was at the center of the outrage over a planned party.A poster advertising a “White Party” last weekend at the Sarayka Lounge in Unawatuna, a coastal town about 3 miles from the southern tourist hub of Galle, specified a white dress code, as is typical for such events. But the poster, which was shared widely on social media and seen by NBC News, also included a line that said “Face Control: White,” drawing outrage from social media users who interpreted it to mean that only white people could attend the event.Three Russian DJs were expected to play at the event, according to the poster.The bar said Friday on Instagram that it had canceled the event and “will never support various racist statements or organizations.”Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has questioned the cancellation of the visa extensions, which he said requires Cabinet approval.John MacDougall / AFP via Getty Images fileA user who claimed to be one of the party’s organizers apologized on Instagram, saying, “There was no malice or racism in this.” “We were sitting in a cafe and discussing that people living far from their homeland have a lot in common and it would be great to gather everyone in one place,” said the user, @geo_ecstatic.“We wanted to meet expats who have been living here for a long time and love Sri Lanka,” the user said, adding that he and his family had to leave the island because of abuse and threats arising from “this stupid idea of making a white party.”In a statement about the “controversial night event,” the Russian Embassy in Colombo said that “according to unconfirmed data, the main promoter as well as the owners of a bar who agreed to accommodate the party are Russian citizens.”Russia “strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination,” it added, calling on its citizens to follow local laws and customs. Sri Lanka has been struggling with an economic crisis since it declared bankruptcy two years ago with more than $83 billion in debt. More than half of that debt is owed to foreign creditors, with the worsening living conditions in the country leading to widespread protests and the ousting of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022.Since then, the new administration has been pulling out all the stops to raise more cash, including a bailout by the International Monetary Fund and an increase in taxes and prices for electricity and fuel. The increased cost of living has pushed some Sri Lankans to the streets again, with police resorting to tear gas to quell a protest in Colombo, the capital, last month.Sri Lanka has also tapped into tourism, providing 30-day visas with multiple extensions of up to six months, with Russians and Ukrainians receiving even more because of the war in Ukraine.",[]

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also linked ratification with U.S. approval of sales of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, with Ankara now expecting the United States to work on securing the U.S. Congress’ endorsement.Hungary’s foot-dragging was less clear in nature with Budapest mostly venting its annoyance over Swedish criticism of the direction of democratic development under nationalist premier Orban rather than any concrete demands.Orban — who has refused to send weapons to neighbouring Ukraine and repeatedly criticised Western sanctions against Russia — on Monday again urged a ceasefire in Ukraine.The accession of Sweden, which has not been at war since 1814, and Finland is the most significant expansion of the alliance since its move into Eastern Europe in the 1990s.While Sweden has ramped up cooperation with the alliance in recent decades, contributing to operations in places such as Afghanistan, its membership is set to simplify defence planning and cooperation on NATO’s northern flank.Sweden also brings resources such as cutting-edge submarines tailored to Baltic Sea conditions and a sizable fleet of domestically produced Gripen fighter jets into the alliance. It is hiking military spending and should reach NATO’s threshold of 2% of GDP this year.The ratification will now be signed by the speaker of parliament and Hungary’s president within a few days, after which the remaining formalities, such as depositing accession documentation in Washington, are likely to be concluded swiftly.",[]

Kamila Grabska, 36, had claimed that a car accident in 2017 left her with “debilitating pain,” leaving her unable to lift heavy bags and keeping her in bed on bad days, according to disclosures made at Ireland's High Court and reported by the Irish Independent newspaper. The constant pain in her back, neck and thoracic spine left her unable to lift groceries, do chores or play with her two children, the newspaper reported the disclosures, made to the court sitting in Limerick, as saying.  She sued RSA Insurance on the basis that she could not work for over five years, claiming past and future loss of earnings that amounted to around $542,000 of her total claim, according to the Irish Independent.Her case came unstuck when a photo published in the newspaper almost a year after her accident showed Grabska winning a Christmas tree throwing contest. The picture, taken in January 2018, shows Grabska, wearing a yellow jacket, forcefully throwing the tree in the town of Ennis in western Ireland, where the championship, based on an old lumberjack competition, takes place. The winner is the person who throws it the farthest.A second picture published the day shows her smiling as she holds a mounted certificate declaring her the champion. When she was cross-examined in court, Grabska said she still felt pain when she threw the Christmas tree and was smiling in photos because she was trying to “live a normal life,” the Irish Independent reported.But Judge Carmel Stewart, who presided over the case, said she had no choice but to dismiss the claim because of the “very graphic picture” of Grabska’s throwing the Christmas tree, which was “at odds” with the medical evidence provided. “I’m afraid I cannot but conclude the claims were entirely exaggerated,” she said. She also took into consideration video from last November, played to the court, showing Grabska play-wrestling with a big Dalmatian dog for up to 1.5 hours, according to the paper.  An entry on the Courts Service of Ireland says Grabska’s case was dismissed last week. It did not include any further details.A spokesperson for RSA Insurance said in a statement that ""the significant majority of claims that we handle are genuine."" They added that the firm was ""very pleased with the outcome of this case and it sends out a clear message that we will robustly challenge any attempt to pursue claims that are not genuine.""   Grabska’s legal representatives not immediately respond to requests for comment.",[]

Mikhail Klimentyev / AFP via Getty Images“The American people deserve to know what their money has gone to. How is the counteroffensive going? Are the Ukrainians any closer to victory than they were 6 months ago?” more than two dozen Republican lawmakers wrote in a letter this month, declaring their opposition to additional U.S. military aid to Ukraine.Not since the years before America entered World War II, when Ohio Sen. Robert Taft and others warned against giving a “blank check” to Britain, has isolationist sentiment gained so much traction in the U.S.On Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ended the debate about U.S. neutrality. More than 80 years later, the outcome of the deadlock in Congress over an aid package to Ukraine and this November’s election could decide whether America continues to play a leadership role in the world or pulls back from its alliances and pursues a go-it-alone agenda.As Ukraine marks two years since Russia’s full-scale invasion, Trump’s supporters in Congress continue to block a proposal to send more help to Ukraine, despite repeated pleas from Kyiv that its soldiers are dying because of shortages of ammunition. Some Republicans that had favored sending more help to Kyiv have shifted their stance, including even Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an outspoken champion of Ukraine’s cause.Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., front, and Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., in the U.S. Capitol on May 2.Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call Inc. via Getty ImagesAnd Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is once again questioning the value of NATO and casting doubts about whether the U.S. would fulfill its commitments to allies if he returns to the White House. Trump said earlier this month he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” if it attacked a NATO country that didn’t spend enough on defense. And he has also said he would consider letting Russia “take over” parts of Ukraine in a possible deal to end the war.“I do see many similarities between the views and arguments of the Taft Republicans of the 1930s and the Trump Republicans today,” said Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, who has written a series of books about the history of U.S. foreign policy.“[In the 1930s], there was a fair amount of sympathy with Nazi Germany among American conservatives, who saw Hitler as a bulwark against communism just as Trump Republicans now look to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin as a great bulwark and leader against liberalism,” said Kagan, author of “The Ghost at the Feast: America and Collapse of World Order, 1900-1941.”Similar to what some GOP lawmakers say about Ukraine’s prospects, Republicans in the 1930s argued that “Britain was certain to lose and that any weapons or money sent to Britain were wasted on a hopeless cause, with the money better spent at home,” Kagan said.Trump’s relentless criticism of Ukraine, U.S. allies and international engagement generally — echoed by his supporters and right-leaning media outlets — appears to have had an effect on public opinion over the past three years, according to recent surveys and analysts.In a new poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a stunning 53% of Republicans said it would be best for the future of the U.S. to stay out of world affairs rather than take an active role. It marked the first time in the 49-year history of the survey that a majority of Republicans adopted that view.As for Ukraine, the share of Americans who say the U.S. is providing too much support to Kyiv has increased steadily since Russia’s full-scale invasion two years ago, particularly among Republicans, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in November and December.Forty-eight percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the U.S. is delivering too much aid to Ukraine, while just 16% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters view the current level of assistance as excessive, the Pew survey said.Firefighters extinguish a fire after a Russian attack on a residential neighborhood in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 10.Yevhen Titov / APNot long ago, sending weapons to Ukraine to fight invading Russian forces would have been roundly embraced by the party of Ronald Reagan, said Matthew Kroenig, vice president at the Atlantic Council think tank.“Reagan really defined modern Republican foreign policy for more than a quarter of a century. The Reagan Doctrine was all about arming freedom fighters against communists wherever they are around the world,” Kroenig said. “That’s not where the party is today.”Instead of Reagan’s ideas about free markets, U.S.-led alliances and America as a beacon of freedom, Trump Republicans are hostile toward multilateral arrangements, free trade, foreign policy “elites” and immigration.Despite growing skepticism of Ukraine aid among GOP voters, many Republicans in Congress still support arming Ukraine, Kroenig said, but a minority in the House has been able to block a vote on a proposed package for Ukraine.Republicans opposed to aiding Ukraine say it’s a useless endeavor and it’s time for Kyiv to admit defeat and negotiate a peace deal with Russia.“I haven’t voted for any money to go to Ukraine because I know they can’t win,” said Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. He was one of more than two dozen Republicans who voted against a proposed Ukraine aid package in the Senate. “Donald Trump’ll stop it when he first gets in. He knows there’s no winning for Ukraine. He can work a deal with Putin.”The rise of a new isolationist, protectionist outlook on the right is not unique to Trump and America. Far-right parties in Europe, advocating what is sometimes called Christian nationalism or conservative nationalism, are also questioning the post-World War II order and are skeptical of arming Ukraine. Polls show them gaining ground.Many Trump loyalists have heaped praise on Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been accused of imposing autocratic rule on his country and has opposed Europe’s aid to Ukraine while keeping up friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Even before Trump emerged as a political figure, the long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq shook many Americans’ faith in Washington’s management of foreign policy, especially on the political left, and raised questions about what was to be gained by U.S. military interventions abroad.But fatigue with the traditional U.S. “internationalist” approach has evolved into a set of grievances stoked by Trump, with the underlying argument claiming that America is threatened by migrants and is getting a raw deal from its partners and the “globalists” who shape U.S. foreign policy.Filling the voidIf the proposed aid for Ukraine fails to win approval in Congress, and if Trump returns to the White House ready to carry out his “America First” agenda, what would it mean for the U.S. and the world?Current and former Western officials and analysts say if the U.S. steps back from alliances, the risk of regional or even world wars would increase, the global economy could enter a more volatile era, and authoritarian adversaries would try to step into the breach.If Russia’s Putin wins in Ukraine, “he, but also other forces like China, are going to learn that it’s possible to just change borders and that NATO is not going to hold it against [them],” Ricarda Lang, a co-leader of Germany’s Green Party, part of the country’s ruling coalition, said at the recent Munich Security Conference.That would lead to “a world with less security, and … a world with less freedom for the E.U. but also for the U.S.”Under the U.S.-led “rules-based order” since World War II, GDP per capita in the world and in the U.S. has increased many times over since 1945. There were about a dozen democracies in the world in 1945, and now there are about 100, Kroenig said. The U.S. and its allies helped usher in a more peaceful, prosperous and relatively stable era over the past 80 years, but Americans now take it for granted, he said.“I think it’s worked so well that people assume it’s the natural state of things, that if the United States withdraws that things will just keep humming along. And unfortunately, that’s not the case,” he said. “If the United States withdraws, bad actors are going to fill the void and we’re going to have conflict and economic chaos.”Advocates of “America First” contend that conditions have changed dramatically since the Cold War, that the U.S. has become overextended, that American workers were shut out of the benefits of free trade and that the U.S. needs to focus on its needs at home, including a crackdown on migration across the southern border.But in a speech at the Munich Security Conference a week ago, Vice President Kamala Harris tried to make the case for America’s “continued global leadership,” warning of the risks of abandoning allies.“History has also shown us: If we only look inward, we cannot defeat threats from outside; isolation is not insulation. In fact, when America has isolated herself, threats have only grown,” she said.At the end of World War I, the U.S. retreated into isolationism, only to be attacked on its home territory, said Mary Elise Sarotte, author of “Not One Inch: America, Russia, and the Making of Post-Cold War Stalemate.”“That approach failed, and since then the U.S. has been committed to starting its defense on the far sides of the oceans,” she said. “It would be a grave mistake to go backwards in time.”",[]

If they do, he said, victory will come “sooner rather than later.”Russia’s U.N. Ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, countered by repeating Moscow’s claim that it didn’t start the conflict. He blamed the West for fomenting it, accused Ukraine of being a tool of Western geopolitical ambitions, and vowed that Russia’s “special military operation” won’t end until its goals are achieved.Those goals — stated on Feb. 24, 2022, the day Russian troops crossed the border — include the de-militarization of Ukraine and ensuring its “neutral status.”The U.N. General Assembly and the Security Council are marking the anniversary with ministerial meetings as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleads for more U.S. military aid and Russian forces make new gains in eastern Ukraine.The General Assembly has become the most important U.N. body dealing with Ukraine because the Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, is paralyzed by Russia’s veto power. Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, unlike Security Council resolutions, but they serve as a barometer of world opinion.Addressing the 193-member assembly, Kuleba recalled that over 140 nations supported resolutions backing Ukraine and calling for Russian forces to withdraw. But, he said, “Moscow’s aim is to destroy Ukraine and they’re quite outspoken about it.”He said countries now saying Ukraine should negotiate with Russia and end the war are either “ill-informed” or didn’t follow events after 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and backed an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine. The two countries, he said, held approximately 200 rounds of negotiations and made 20 cease-fire agreements.“All of these peace efforts ended two years ago, when Russia tore apart the Minsk process and launched its full-scale invasion,” Kuleba said. “Why would anyone suggest today that following the same logic will bring us to a different result?”Zelenskyy’s 10-point peace plan is “the only serious peace proposal on the table,” Kuleba said, calling on other countries to add their diplomatic weight to it. The plan calls for expelling Russian forces, establishing a special tribunal to prosecute alleged Russian war crimes and building a European-Atlantic security architecture with guarantees for Ukraine.When Russia invaded, diplomats and experts didn’t believe Ukraine would survive. Speaking to reporters, Kuleba said he wanted to make one point clear.“Today, the same people do not believe that Ukraine can win this war,” he said. “They turned wrong once, and they will turn wrong again. Ukraine survived the invasion. Ukraine will win the war. And if we act collectively and jointly this will happen … sooner rather than later.”Nebenzia slammed Zelenskyy’s plan.“It is nothing other than an ultimatum to Russia and an attempt to lure as many countries as possible into endless meetings on this utopian project at any price possible,” he said.At the General Assembly, where representatives of 64 countries are scheduled to speak, there was strong support for Ukraine.Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he recognized that there is a sense of fatigue with the war and a compromise might seem attractive, but he said Russian President Vladimir Putin isn’t seeking compromise.“Rather, this is a neo-imperialist bully who believes might is right,” he said. “If Putin were to eke out some kind of win, the rest of the world would suffer, too. What starts in Ukraine would not end there.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefed the council, saying Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine violated the U.N. Charter and international law and, two years later, “the war in Ukraine remains an open wound at the heart of Europe.”“The danger of the conflict escalating and expanding is very real,” he said.China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun, whose country is a Russian ally, said Beijing respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and all other countries, and urged stepped-up peace efforts. He also stressed that “the legitimate security concerns of all countries” must be respected, and criticized NATO’s eastward expansion — which Moscow has strongly opposed.And U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that through all of Russia’s “lies, Putin has tried to rewrite history, to justify the unjustifiable, to break the will of the Ukrainian people, and to break the will of the international community.”“We cannot let that happen,” she said.",[]

This is not just a nice thing to do. We are obligated to come. It is imperative to come.""Schumer, whose ancestors lived in what today is Ukraine, pointed to the foreign aid package approved by the Senate, but said ""unfortunately, the House has still not made up their minds. And one of the main reasons we've come here is to help them make up their minds.""""We want to tell them what we have seen, we want to show them,"" Schumer continued. ""We have heard from so many that if you don't get the aid you will lose the war. But if you get the aid you will win the war.""Earlier, the senators joined U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at a Lviv cemetery, where they laid bouquets of red flowers in a ceremony ""to honor Ukraine's brave heroes who paid the ultimate sacrifice for freedom for their nation,"" Brink wrote on X.For months, Zelenskyy has warned the U.S. and other allies that his military is running out of weapons. Without an emergency infusion of aid, he said, Russia will try to get the upper hand.Last week, Ukraine withdrew from the city of Avdiivka, a key battleground on the war front.But U.S. aid for Ukraine has been stalled in Congress since late last year. On Feb. 13, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan; the lopsided vote was 70-29. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has refused to put the Senate package on the House floor, saying Congress needs to protect the southern border and enact tough, new border policies before supplying Ukraine with more aid.Earlier this month, a group of bipartisan Senate negotiators struck a deal on stricter asylum and border policies — an agreement that was endorsed by Senate leaders in both parties. But Republicans quickly abandoned the deal after former President Donald Trump and his congressional allies blasted it for not going far enough.In a statement Friday, Schumer laid out four objectives of the visit: to show the Ukrainian people that America supports them and will fight to get the aid; to demonstrate the U.S. is not deserting NATO and its European allies; to learn about the weapons Ukraine needs and what advantages Russia would gain if the arms are not delivered; and to recognize “there will be severe political, diplomatic, economic and military consequences that will significantly hurt the American people” if the U.S. abandons its allies.“When we return to Washington, we will make clear to Speaker Johnson — and others in Congress who are obstructing military and economic support — exactly what is at stake here in Ukraine and for the rest of Europe and the free world,” Schumer said in the statement.“We will keep working to ensure Congress steps up, does the right thing, and delivers help for our friends and allies.”The four Democrats joining Schumer’s congressional delegation, which is in Lviv, are Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed of Rhode Island; Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a member of Reed’s panel; Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, a member of the Intelligence Committee; and Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, chair of the Homeland Security subcommittee on Emerging Threats.In December, Zelenskyy traveled to Washington, where he appealed directly to Johnson, Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other congressional leaders for more aid.""President Zelenskyy’s message was direct: Ukraine will win the war against Russia if more aid is approved. But his message to the contrary was also true: If no more aid is approved, Putin will win,"" Schumer, of New York, said after the Dec. 12 meeting. ""Ukraine, the West, the United States’ strength as a credible ally are all hanging in the balance right now.""",[]

He noted the action is timed with the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. is also imposing export restrictions on almost 100 entities that support Russia’s military efforts and taking action to reduce Russia's energy revenues, Biden said.""I’ve directed my team to strengthen support for civil society, independent media, and those who fight for democracy around the world,"" he added. Biden emphasized the need for Congress to pass the Senate foreign aid package, saying Ukraine is ""running out of ammunition."" Ukraine needs more supplies from the U.S. to ""hold the line against Russia's relentless attacks,"" which are enabled by ammunition and arms from Iran and North Korea, the president said. ""That’s why the House of Representatives must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental bill, before it’s too late,"" Biden said. At an event with the nation's governors later in the morning, Biden reiterated that call, criticizing the House for going on ""vacation"" instead of taking action on the legislation. The House is currently on recess, with lawmakers back home in their districts. Biden encouraged the governors to urge their states' members of Congress to force the bill to be brought up for a vote in the House.  Biden said America must prove to the world that it stands up for freedom and will ""never bow to anyone — particularly Putin."" The president mentioned the sanctions package to the governors, drawing widespread applause, and said it's part of an effort to respond to Putin's ""brutal war of conquest"" in Ukraine and Navalny's death. ""Because make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Alexei's death,"" Biden said.  The Treasury Department said in a release detailing the sanctions that its Office of Foreign Assets Control is targeting almost 300 individuals and entities; combined with actions by the State Department, the administration's moves bring the total number of targets sanctioned to more than 500 — the largest number of sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine, the release said. Treasury also noted that the State Department is designating three Russian government officials in connection with Navalny's death, but didn't identify them. The Department of Commerce, meanwhile, is placing trade restrictions on more than 90 companies.Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told reporters Thursday night that the sanctions aim to do two things: ""One is reducing Russia’s revenues; the second is making sure that Russia can’t get access to the goods they need to build the weapons they want for their war.”Adeyemo said previous U.S. sanctions have been successful, reducing the country's oil revenues by 40% and causing Russia to struggle to access goods it needs to build weapons. ""Fundamentally, our strategy does not only pertain to slowing down Russia’s ability to build the weapons they want, it also includes speeding up the Ukrainians' ability to defend themselves by providing them with weapons and resources to build their economy,"" Adeyemo said. He added that people won't recognize many of the hundreds of names on the sanctions list ""because ever since our first round of sanctions, Russia has been leveraging its intelligence services to find ways to evade our actions and procure the goods it needs to resupply the battlefield and now to make those goods at home.""Russia’s wartime transformation is allowing the U.S. to target densely concentrated production ""in new and efficient way,"" Ademeyo said. ""With such vertical integration, we can hit the entire supply chain, and attempts to fortify his military industrial base have only made it more vulnerable. If Russia is going to turn its industries into wartime producers, then all Russians production is now fair game.”The sanctions package, which the president previewed Tuesday, was announced exactly a week after Russia's prison service said Navalny, 47, died in a Russian penal colony above the Arctic Circle. He was serving a combined prison sentence of more than 30 years on charges of extremism and fraud, which he denied. On Thursday, Biden met with Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and their daughter, Dasha, in California. Navalny’s mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, said in a video statement Thursday that she was allowed access to her son’s body in a morgue, but her lawyer had not been able to come with her. She alleged Russian authorities were ""blackmailing"" her by threatening that if she didn’t agree to a secret funeral, they would “do something with the body.”",[]

Their main concern is that a re-elected Trump would double down — halting aid to Ukraine and reneging on Washington’s promise to defend its NATO partners — to leave them more vulnerable to attack by Russia.“If Trump were re-elected, we would face a situation in Europe that has not occurred since the end of the Second World War,” said Norbert Röttgen, a veteran German lawmaker and ex-chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee. “Europe would have to stand up for its own security in an unprecedented way.”The paradox is that many of these critics, while reviling Trump’s tactics, rhetoric and motives, actually agree with his central point: Europe has for too long depended on the United States’ military might and geopolitical influence. The prospect of Trump back in the White House has only lent new urgency to those driving this effort, particularly in light of recent indications that he might be happy to leave Russian President Vladimir Putin free rein to act aggressively at home and abroad.Europe is far from united, however, with an expected far-right surge in June elections led by nationalist parties that share Trump’s Ukraine skepticism. On the other side of the aisle, those who want to bolster Europe’s defenses know it would be a costly, complex and lengthy process — hence the fierce debate currently raging over how to do so.“Nothing should be off the table to enhance Europe’s sovereignty in the face of a possible second Trump term,” said Valérie Hayer, a senior European Parliament lawmaker from France.“Europe has relied on the U.S. to provide its security for too long,” said Hayer, who leads the Renew Europe group, and is French President Emmanuel Macron’s top lawmaker in Brussels. “It’s high time for Europe to improve its own deterrence capacities and take its security into its own hands.”Many here believe that Trump would be economically protectionist and perhaps even launch new trade wars against Europe. But by far their main concern is about defense — namely against Russia.Europe’s economy dwarfs that of Moscow’s, but since the Cold War it has relied on the U.S. for defense against the Kremlin. Its two nuclear powers, the United Kingdom and France, have relatively small and untested arsenals, illustrated by the revelation this week that Britain recently had a failed nuclear submarine test launch. Europe’s conventional forces, meanwhile, would provide scant protection in a full-scale land war without American backing.Washington’s NATO allies have in recent years increased defense spending, spurred by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. But Trump’s blunt ultimatum to NATO — pay more or we would not protect you — has convinced many across the continent that they need to accelerate and coordinate the production and supply of weapons.Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, criticized Biden’s record in Europe, and said the president had presided over “death and destruction” on the continent. “President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer,"" he said in a written statement. ""When you don’t pay your defense spending, you can’t be surprised that you get more war.” Then-President Donald Trump shaking hands with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the NATO summit in London on Dec. 4, 2019. Christian Hartmann / Pool via AFP - Getty Images fileThe former president may have focused minds, but he is not the sole cause of the reckoning European leaders are undergoing.Many in Europe recognize that, even if President Joe Biden wins in November, the isolationist ideas that Trump popularized among some Republicans will not disappear. European leaders and officials are, in this sense, not so much insulating themselves against a potential Trump administration but against a new normal in transatlantic relations.Leaders are also facing equivocating support among the European people themselves when it comes to support for Ukraine. More people now back a negotiated peace with Russia than they did last year, according to January polling of 17,000 people across 12 countries by the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank.The impending election “is a wake-up call” for Europe, said Dominic Grieve, a former senior British lawmaker who until 2019 chaired the country’s parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. But “whoever wins the next presidential election in the States, I think the writing’s on the wall for previous levels of U.S. interest in Europe,” said Grieve, a former lawmaker with the ruling Conservative Party.This would mean a drastic reordering of the transatlantic relationship that has existed since the aftermath of World War II. Presidents from Harry Truman to Barack Obama have indeed urged Europe to increase military spending. But none have come close to Trump’s unvarnished quid pro quo on spending.Ukraine’s military struggles against Russia have coincided with a softening of support for Kyiv across Europe, according to January polling by the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, with more people now backing a negotiated peace with Russia.Trump’s critics question whether he really wants to strengthen NATO, an alliance he’s criticized for decades, or is merely using the spending argument as an excuse to junk it. Either way, NATO’s European members say that the sentiment, regardless of motive, is reason enough to act.“We will have to increase the effectiveness of our armies, we will have to reorganize and expand our industrial defense capacities, and this would not go overnight, it would take time,” Röttgen, the German lawmaker, who was a member of former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet.Röttgen is among those who say not enough is being done. But the E.U. says it’s trying. Next month, the bloc will release its European Defense Industrial Strategy, a grand plan for its 27 member states to cooperate on manufacturing and distributing weapons.European President Ursula von der Leyen has sought to cast these attempted reforms as complementary to U.S. cooperation — rather than an insurance policy for its absence.“Europe has to step up its industrial base,” she  told a panel at the Munich Security Conference. “I’m a convinced transatlanticist and at the same time we have to build a strong Europe and that goes hand in hand.”These diplomatic noises notwithstanding, Trump’s potential second coming undoubtedly looms large. Already his Republican allies in Congress have stalled aid to Ukraine, leaving it newly vulnerable to Moscow’s war machine. Europe has tried to step up, but the results so far have not been promising. In January, the European Union admitted it only managed to fulfill half of its promise to send 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine.Beyond Ukraine, both Danish and Estonian officials have this year raised the alarm about Russia’s ability and even intent to attack a NATO member within the next decade. Russia is expected to produce 3.5 million units of artillery ammunition this year, according to Estonian estimates. By contrast, Europe is expected to be able to produce around 1.4 million shells by the end of the year.For these NATO members, then, Trump is undermining the alliance at the very moment they may have to call on its Article 5 all-for-one-and-one-for-all mutual defense clause.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock spelled out Europe’s dependence on the alliance during an interview with NBC News at the Munich Security Conference.Asked about the former president’s threat, Baerbock said NATO “is our life insurance” — not only for Europe but Washington, too. Without naming Trump directly, she added that “every person in the world, especially in liberal democracies, understands that this is the moment where you have to show where you’re standing for freedom for peace and security.”She said NATO and the E.U. were “stronger than ever before.” But not everyone at Munich was so upbeat.“We are already late,” Röttgen, the senior German lawmaker, said of Europe’s Trump-proofing plans. “But it’s better to start late than not at all,” he said, because “the consequences of Trump’s reelection would affect Europe in the most impactful and dangerous way.”",[]

Ukraine’s national energy company and former employees at the plant are also sounding the alarm.    “It is the most dangerous situation that we have,” Grossi told NBC News in an interview last week. “It’s my job not to sow panic, but at the same time I have to tell the truth about what is happening.” There was growing international alarm when the site was shelled in the months after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine two years ago this Saturday, Feb. 24. And Ukrainian officials have also warned about staffing levels and general maintenance of the plant, which became operational in 1984.   Both sides have since blamed the other for attacks in the vicinity of the complex, which Russian forces seized shortly after the start of the war and is almost twice the size of Ukraine’s Chernobyl plant, the site of the deadly 1986 disaster widely considered the worst nuclear accident on record. Satellite imagery from July shows the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and it's six uranium-fueled reactors, currently in a cold shutdown. MaxarThe atomic energy agency has repeatedly warned about the dangers of a direct attack on the site, although it has noted there has been no shelling of the facility since May. However, Russian forces remain in control of the plant, which is right on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, and all the territory around it, including the company town of Enerhodar. Ukrainian forces have maintained control of the river’s other bank.  As the focus of the fighting has shifted farther north, another concern is the frequent power outages at the plant, where eight blackouts have been reported since the start of the war, the most recent in December, according to both the IAEA and Energoatom, Ukraine’s national energy company.“When you have a blackout, lack of external power supply at a nuclear power plant, the cooling function of the reactors is lost, and you could have a meltdown,” Grossi said. He added that the situation could be compared to 2011’s disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan, when three reactors melted down in an accident caused by a huge tsunami that battered the country’s eastern coast.Zaporizhzhia is different because the plant’s six Soviet-era reactors were put into semi-shutdown to stop the nuclear fission reaction and generation of heat and pressure shortly after the start of the war. As a result, they are in a colder state than those in Fukushima and therefore less volatile.Powering the plant has nonetheless become increasingly difficult because three of the four lines supplying the complex have been destroyed and the fourth is faulty, according to Petro Kotin, the CEO of Energoatom, which ran the facility before it was taken by Russian forces. For now, the plant is relying on 20 backup diesel generators to keep the reactors operating safely, said Kotin, who is still in contact with a number of Ukrainian workers at the plant.  The destruction of the Kakhovka dam farther up the Dnieper River has also proved problematic for operators at the plant. Water from the dam’s reservoir had been used to cool the reactors, which now could overheat and melt down if turned on. Satellite imagery from last June shows depleted water levels of the Dnieper River by the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, following the destruction of the Khakovka dam. MaxarNew wells are being drilled at the plant to make up for the supply of cooling water lost by the dam’s collapse, according to the IAEA.  Another serious point of concern is the lack of qualified staff to oversee safety under the plant’s current operators, a subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear company, Rosatom.Before the war, about 11,000 employees worked at the plant, many of whom fled as Russian forces advanced. Now there is just a skeleton crew of about 4,000, according to Energoatom, which like Kotin still receives information from both current and former staff members. Kotin said the Ukrainian staff who stayed behind were forced “under pressure and even under torture” to sign contracts with Rosatom. NBC News has asked Rosatom for comment on power supply and the staffing issues at the plant. After the plant fell into Russian hands, Serhii Romanyuk said he reluctantly continued to work there as a deputy head of nuclear safety, which meant he was responsible for the safe storage of new and used nuclear fuel.But in September 2022, he said he was called into the office of the main engineer and was arrested by representatives of the Federal Security Service (FSB) — the domestic intelligence service that succeeded the Soviet-era KGB.Romanyuk said they wanted to know if he had a weapon, so they escorted him back to his apartment in Enerhodar to conduct a search. “They put a hot iron on my chest, choked me, they put a bag on my head so I couldn’t breathe,” he said. “All of that was followed by a beating.”Although they did not find a weapon, he said they took him to a police cell where he was held in a small, windowless room, crammed with people.The interrogations and the beatings continued, but this time he said they were searching for information about other members of the staff who were pro-Ukrainian.“They were trying to convince me to collaborate with them, but it wasn’t about working at the nuclear plant,” he said. “They were interested in some other field of collaboration.”After more than a month in captivity, he said was released after he refused to cooperate.  Now living in Kyiv, Romanyuk said he feared for the plant because of the poor quality of the remaining staff and the degradation of equipment. On the few occasions he has received information about the facility, he said it appeared that “nothing is done there in terms of maintenance.” Allegations of abuse against Ukrainian workers have been widespread since Russia took over the plant. A recent investigation by the Ukrainian human rights organization Truth Hounds featured testimony from several people who also alleged similar treatment. It said that Ukrainians on site were targeted for suspicion of working with Ukrainian forces, cooperating with the country’s intelligence services or of having anti-Russian views.NBC News has asked the FSB and Rosatom for comment about the allegations that workers at the plant have been tortured.   Kotin, the Energoatom CEO, warns that the staffing issue is affecting the overall maintenance of the plant, further increasing the chance of something going wrong and that this is getting worse because of the degradation of the site. “You can get to the point when any small event somewhere will bring just a cumulative effect,” he said. “After that, you will have this disaster.”Richard Engel and Charlotte Gardiner reported from Kyiv, and Gabe Joselow from London.",[]

Karelina became a U.S. citizen in 2021, the U.S. official said.Speaking with NBC Los Angeles, Karelina’s boyfriend Chris Van Heerden said she traveled to Russia to see her family, including her 90-year-old grandmother, on Jan. 2 after the couple spent New Year’s together in Turkey. Van Heerden, who said he has been dating Karelina for six months, said she did not appear to have any reservations about returning to Russia when they parted. “She was like, ‘I’m going to be fine, it’s good. I’m Russian, I’m good,’” Van Heerden said. But he said Karelina faced problems from the moment she arrived and was detained at the airport. She was eventually released, although authorities kept her mobile phone, Van Heerden said. They used her mother’s phone to communicate in the meanwhile, he said, but on Jan. 27 she said she was going to pick up her phone, and it was the last time they spoke. “Bring her back, she’s just a normal person,” he added. Chris Van Heerden said he has been dating 33-year-old Ksenia Karelina for about six months.via KTLAThe FSB alleged that since Feb. 2022, Karelina had “proactively collected funds in the interests of one of the Ukrainian organizations, which were subsequently used to purchase tactical medicine, equipment, weapons and ammunition by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” It did not provide further details or evidence of her alleged crime. A criminal case has been launched against her, the FSB said, and she is facing charges of treason, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.  A video released by the FSB on Tuesday alleges to show Karelina’s detention. A woman, blindfolded by a white hat on her head, can be seen being handcuffed and led through hallways and a staircase by a man wearing a camouflage uniform and balaclava. In another shot, she can be seen behind bars and then being led into a room, with her face blurred. NBC News could not verify if the video shows Karelina. The State Department said Tuesday that it was seeking consular assistance in Karelina’s case, but spokesman Matthew Miller warned that when it comes to dual citizens, Moscow considers them to be Russian citizens “first and foremost,” which can complicate gaining access to them. The website of the Sverdlovsk Region Court in the area where she was detained said that a Feb. 20 hearing for Karelina was postponed. She is scheduled to have another hearing on Feb. 29, according to the site. Isabella Koretz, the owner of Ciel Spa at the SLS Beverly Hills where Karelina has worked for eight years, told The Associated Press that Karelina came to the U.S. to study at the University of Maryland in Baltimore before relocating to Los Angeles. She said Karelina is divorced and does not have any relatives in the U.S. Koretz said she grew concerned when Karelina stopped returning her messages and phone calls after entering Russia, and when she ultimately did not return from her trip as planned. The spa said in a statement posted on Facebook that Karelina’s alleged crime was donating $51.80 to a Ukrainian charity in the U.S. Authorities have not confirmed that, and NBC News was not able to independently verify the sum or the nature of the alleged donation. Karelina had been working as an esthetician in Los Angeles.Ksenia Leonteva via APKarelina’s detention is part of a long-standing trend of Russian authorities detaining foreign citizens and Russian citizens who have citizenship of another country. Two journalists with American citizenship are currently in Russian custody. In the most recent case, in January, U.S. national Robert Romanov Woodland was arrested and detained in Russia on drug trafficking charges.“You can’t say it’s a novelty,” Dmitry Zair-Bek, head of the rights group First Department, which has commented on the case, told NBC News. “But yes, Russian authorities regularly detain American citizens, German citizens and citizens of other countries in order to replenish the so-called informal exchange fund.”In Dec. 2022, U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner, who was detained and sentenced in Russia on drug charges earlier that year, was released from custody in a high-profile swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. “These are still isolated cases, but it’s a Russian roulette,” Dmitry Zair-Bek said of the growing number of cases of people with foreign citizenship being detained in Russia. “You never know what will happen. So if there is an opportunity not to go, it’s best to be cautious.”",[]

And you asked who would be preferred as future president of the United States,” Putin said. “I said that we would work with any president. But I suppose that for us, for Russia, Biden is more preferable. Judging by what he has just said, I was absolutely right.”Biden has a tendency to go off script during election fundraisers and in recent months has used these more informal events to criticize China, the Republican Party and U.S. ally Israel.But in recent days he has also stepped up his criticism of Trump, particularly in regard to his approach to Putin.At the fundraiser Wednesday night, Biden criticized Trump for likening his situation to that of Navalny, whose death in an Arctic penal colony has seen Biden and other Western leaders point the finger at the Kremlin.“He’s comparing himself to Navalny and saying that because our country has become a communist country"" he has been ""persecuted just like Navaly was persecuted — where the hell does this come from,"" he said. “If I stood here 10, 15 years ago and said this you all would have thought that I should be committed — it’s astounding.”The Kremlin has denied involvement in Navalny's death and criticized the U.S. and others for what it said was a rush to judgment before any facts are known. Navalny's family has accused Putin of holding his body as part of a cover up. The Biden administration is set to announce a major sanctions package Friday to hold Russia accountable.Also at the San Francisco fundraiser, Biden said that nine heads of state from other countries had urged him to defeat Trump for the sake of democracy.“As I walk out of meetings, a head of state will find an excuse to come up close and say: 'You’ve got to win.' Not because I’m so special,"" he said. “You’ve got to win because my democracy is at stake if the other guy wins,"" he added, recalling the conversations.Biden also suggested that the current generation of Republican congressmen and women were “worse” than racist, segregationist lawmakers that he served with in the past.“I’ve served with real racists; I’ve served with Strom Thurmond,” the president said referring to the former pro-segregation senator from South Carolina. “I’ve served with all these guys that have set terrible records on race. But guess what? These guys are worse,” he added. referring to current Republicans. “These guys do not believe in basic democratic principles.”Biden, 81, who is facing questions about his age and memory, has a history of using blunt words when it comes to other world leaders.In 2021, he agreed with an interviewer that Putin was a “killer” and last year labeled Chinese President Xi Jinping a “dictator” — comments that caused a considerable degree of diplomatic fallout.Putin said last week that his country would prefer to see the “more experienced” Biden in the White House for a second term than Trump.",[]

It needs to be built on,” Putin told Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in the Kremlin.“But that development must be well-prepared, provided with personnel, weapons, equipment and ammunition,” Putin said. “It seems to be self-evident, but nevertheless I draw your attention to it.”Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNN that Avdiivka would not have fallen had Kyiv received weapons held up by the U.S. Congress’ failure to approve a large aid package.Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery in the direction of Avdiivka on Feb. 18, 2024.

Russia does not intend to pause or withdraw...Once Avdiivka is under their control, they undoubtedly will choose another city and begin to storm it,” Kuleba said.Ukrainian troops, he said, were “making miracles...but the reason they have to sacrifice themselves and die is that someone is still debating a decision. I want everyone to remember that every day of debate in one place means another death in another place.”The U.S. Senate this month passed a $95 billion aid package that includes funds for Ukraine, but House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson has declined to bring it up for a vote on the floor of the House.Ukraine said it withdrew its soldiers to save them from being fully surrounded after months of fierce fighting. The Ukrainian military said there had been casualties, but that the situation had stabilized somewhat after the retreat.Each side said the other had suffered huge losses.After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines in the east and south last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appointed a new commander last week to run the war.Civilians board an evacuation train after an increase of Russian missile strikes on settlements in the area around Avdiivka, on Tuesday.Thomas Peter / ReutersPutin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering full-scale war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other.Avdiivka, called Avdeyevka by Russians, has endured a decade of conflict. It holds particular symbolism for Russia as it was briefly taken in 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists who seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine, but was then recaptured by Ukrainian troops who built extensive fortifications.Avdiivka sits in the industrial Donbas region, 9 miles north of the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Before the war, Avdiivka’s Soviet-era coke plant was one of Europe’s biggest.Shoigu said Russian forces had also taken control of the village of Krynky in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region.

They argue that the prosecution is politically motivated and he won’t get a fair trial in the U.S.Assange’s lawyers argued on the first day of the hearing on Tuesday that American authorities are seeking to punish Assange for WikiLeaks’ “exposure of criminality on the part of the U.S. government on an unprecedented scale,” including torture and killings.Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said Assange may “suffer a flagrant denial of justice” if he is sent to the U.S.Assange’s lawyers say he could face up to 175 years in prison if convicted, though American authorities have said the sentence is likely to be much shorter.Assange was not in court on Tuesday because he is unwell, his lawyer said. Stella Assange, his wife, said Julian had wanted to attend, but was “not in good condition.”Assange’s family and supporters say his physical and mental health have suffered during more than a decade of legal battles, including seven years in self-exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and the last five years in the high-security prison on the outskirts of the British capital.Stella Assange, who married the WikiLeaks founder in prison in 2022 — said last week that his health has deteriorated during years of confinement and “if he’s extradited, he will die.”Supporters holding “Free Julian Assange” signs and chanting “there is only one decision — no extradition” held a noisy protest outside the neo-Gothic High Court building for a second day on Wednesday.Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. In 2012, Assange jumped bail and sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested and imprisoned him for breaching bail in 2012. Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed.A U.K. district court judge rejected the U.S. extradition request in 2021 on the grounds that Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh U.S. prison conditions. Higher courts overturned that decision after getting assurances from the U.S. about his treatment. The British government signed an extradition order in June 2022.Meanwhile, the Australian parliament last week called for Assange to be allowed to return to his homeland.If judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson rule against Assange, he can ask the European Court of Human Rights to block his extradition — though supporters worry he could be put on a plane to the U.S. before that happens, because the British government has already signed an extradition order.The two justices could deliver a verdict at the end of the hearing on Wednesday, but they’re more likely to take several weeks to consider their decision.",[]

She regularly attended protests and rallies with him, and was a constant presence as Navalny campaigned against official corruption and fought for a more democratic Russia. But she stayed largely in her husband’s shadow — until his life hung in the balance. When Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020, Navalnaya played a pivotal role in getting him out of Russia for emergency treatment, even pleading with Putin in writing to let her husband be flown to Germany. Navalny later said she saved his life. Navalnaya said at the time that she had to wear sunglasses so that no one could see her crying. That stoicism was on display when the news of her husband’s death broke Friday while she was back in Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference. She stepped in front of a microphone, her face pale but determined, to make clear that if her husband really was dead, she wanted the Kremlin to know that it would bear responsibility for what it did to her family and her country.Three days later, she delivered a lengthy, surprise video address accusing Putin of killing her husband — putting herself directly in the Kremlin’s crosshairs.“Putin killed half of me, half of my heart, half of my soul,” she said, her voice trembling at times through the 9-minute address. “But I have the other half left, and it’s telling me that I don’t have the right to give up.”It was seen by many as a declaration of her own political ambitions at a time when the Russian opposition — already decimated by years of repression and the crackdown that followed the war in Ukraine — was now reeling from the loss of its chief. “This really is a political bid for leadership,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “She has a chance to become a unifying figure, because she can become a moral symbol of resistance.”Suggestions that Navalnaya should take Navalny’s place have been circulating since he was barred from running in the 2018 presidential election. Asked about her political ambition in an interview in Harper’s Bazaar in 2021, however, she said it was “much more interesting to be a politician’s wife.” And as recently as last March, she told the German weekly Der Spiegel that she was not going to enter politics to “replace” her husband.",[]

Eleven of Ukraine’s 27 regions are strewn with mines, according to Human Rights Watch. All told, about 30% of Ukraine’s territory is infested with land mines, an area roughly equivalent to the state of Florida.The range of hidden weapons lurking underfoot includes powerful anti-vehicle mines that can blow up a tank or a large bus, smaller anti-personnel mines designed to kill or maim anyone who triggers it, as well as improvised booby traps and unexploded munitions.  Nearly 1,000 civilians in Ukraine have been killed by mines since the war began, according to aid groups. And most of those civilian casualties were caused by anti-vehicle mines planted in areas where Ukrainians were trying to return to and revive their farms. Worldwide, land mines killed approximately 1,600 people, the vast majority of them civilians, in 2022. They infest roughly 50 countries, endangering local populations for decades after conflicts end.  “The land mines impact every aspect of our life as a country,” Anastasia Radina, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, said in an interview with NBC News.“It is a huge issue for farmers,” she added, “and it’s also impacting civilians, literally kids going to the park or to the forest, they can actually encounter landmines in many territories of Ukraine.”Russian forces in Ukraine have deployed a deadly new type of anti-personnel mine, known as the POM-3, which is designed to detonate when someone walks nearby, using seismic sensors. The Russian innovation makes the weapon more difficult to locate and disarm, and more challenging to remove once combat has ended.The POM-3, about the size of a soft-drink can, is usually launched by a rocket before it parachutes to the ground, where it sticks a small probe in the dirt. When the seismic probe detects a person walking nearby, it fires an explosive that detonates in midair, spewing metal fragments.Mines planted by Russian forces have hampered attempts by Ukrainian troops to liberate captured territory, killing soldiers, slowing ground offensives and wrecking armored vehicles. Ukraine’s military has had to mount elaborate and time-consuming efforts to clear mines and carve out assault lanes for its armored units.Ukrainian troops have also employed mines to roll back Russian forces. Last year, Ukrainian troops repeatedly used rocket-fired anti-personnel mines while attacking Russian forces occupying the city of Izium, according to a report from Human Rights Watch. Ukraine’s government told Human Rights Watch it could not comment on the types of weapons it is using until the war is over and its sovereignty restored.To date, 164 nations have signed a 1997 international accord, the Mine Ban Treaty, which bars the use of anti-personnel mines. Ukraine signed the agreement but Russia, the United States, China and roughly two dozen other nations have not.The $95 billion U.S. aid package to Ukraine currently under consideration by Congress includes a provision that would fund land mine clearance in the country. If passed by the House and Senate, $100 million of that aid would go toward removing land mines. The HALO Trust, a humanitarian organization that rose to  prominence when it caught the attention of Princess Diana in the 1990s, is one of at least four nonprofit groups working to remove land mines in Ukraine.The CEO of the HALO Trust, retired British army officer James Cowan, told NBC News that his staff trains 1,200 employees, 98% of them Ukrainian, to safely demine the country’s liberated cities. Cowan said that 20,000 mines have been cleared by the HALO Trust, 8,500 of which were anti-tank mines, since the start of the war. The United Nations Development Programme, with the financial support of Western countries, funds nearly 80% of Ukraine’s demining efforts.Women comprise nearly half of HALO's staff, Cowan said, in part because men between the ages of 18 and 60 are obligated to conscript in the military. “Women are very meticulous deminers, they’re courageous people,” Cowan said. Olena Boryslavska, a 46-year-old former consultant, is one of them. Before the war, Boryslavska spent 12 years helping various industries adopt new technologies, most recently agriculture. “I couldn’t stay in my comfort zone. It’s like I had an internal calling,” she told NBC News in a phone interview. After Boryslavska  saw multiple advertisements, including one showing women demining terrain in Sri Lanka, she applied. “I figured it was safe enough if women were doing it all over the world,” she said.Though the risks are high, Boryslavska loves the work. “It’s obviously not the profession I dreamed of when I was a young girl,"" she said. ""But with HALO, every single minute of my job yields a result I can see and feel, every land mine I remove from the ground I know is one step toward a free Ukraine.” Cowan, the head of HALO, traveled to Washington, D.C., last week  to lobby members of Congress to support the Ukraine aid package. “I actually think our cause, which ultimately is about stopping someone being blown up by a land mine, is very bipartisan,” Cowan said. “Who on earth wants to see a child lose its legs from a land mine?” In 2018, members of Congress formed the bipartisan Unexploded Ordnance and Demining Caucus to help highlight the use of American tax dollars for demining efforts worldwide.As Congress now debates sending additional support to Ukraine, some pro-Trump Republicans argue that economic assistance, which includes funds for demining efforts, is unnecessary. Other Trump supporters in Congress have ruled out sending what they refer to as a “blank check” to Ukraine, claiming that much of the aid is lost to corruption. Radina, the Ukrainian Parliament member, denies the corruption allegations and says more U.S. aid is desperately needed. Ukrainian refugees who want to return home are hesitant to do so because of the continuing threat of land mines.“How are they expected to return to their normal lives if there is no normal life?” she said.Cowan worries that the U.S. could cease military and economic support for Ukraine altogether. “I think the world is very prone to move from one crisis to the next and to lose interest,” he said. “We’ve got to stay patient and persistent in our strategy.”Cowan said untrained Ukrainian civilians are increasingly desperate to reclaim their land. “They want to plant a crop.

But don't call it a win for democracy.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/2024-elections-democracy-trump-biden-putin-rcna132799,2024-02-20T09:56:59.749Z,"LONDON — This year, more than any in recent memory, global democracy rests on the edge of a knife: Never before will so many people around the world have the opportunity to vote, but rarely have democracy’s core tenets been so fundamentally threatened.In 2024, around half the world will go to the polls — some 4 billion people in 76 nations — the most of any year on record. Some of these elections will be widely considered fair, such as those already held in Taiwan and Finland; others are likely to have a thumb on the scale, with leaders shackling opponents and the media, as in Rwanda. And the so-called votes in Russia, North Korea and elsewhere will be an outright sham.The pivotal centerpiece, even for many outside the United States, will be the anticipated contest between President Joe Biden and his presumed opponent, former President Donald Trump. Still baselessly rejecting his loss in 2020 and vowing to crack down on his opponents if he wins this year, Trump is a man many see as a threat to democracy, not only in America but also around the world.“This is a big stress test for democracy globally,” said Kelley E. Currie, who has held senior State Department roles, including under Trump, for whom she was the U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues. “The autocracies are linked up and working together,” she said, adding that “2024 will be an important inflection point for us.”Charles Parton, a British diplomat whose 40-year career has included postings in China, Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Libya, agrees. “Democracy is suffering from a virus; it is not well at present,” he said.This is not an overnight crisis but rather part of a yearslong process.Democracy has been on the slide since 2016, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London research group whose yearly ranking system has become a gold standard. Advances “made over the last 35 years have been wiped out” and democracy is now at its lowest ebb since 1986, a report last year by Sweden’s University of Gothenburg agreed.Of the 76 elections in 2024, just 43 will be free and fair, it said in a briefing last year.“There is a lot of reason to think that the net outcome of 2024 is going to be that we see fewer democratic practices and weaker democratic institutions in many parts of the world,” said Sarah Yi-Yun Shair-Rosenfield, a politics professor at England’s University of York.Arguably, the most pivotal race will come in the U.S.Era-defining threat?America’s democratic backsliding is not new. Since 2010, executive power overreach, gerrymandering and toxic polarization have all worsened, according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank.But Trump’s return presents a perhaps era-defining threat, according to experts and advocates.Trump continues to baselessly claim he won the 2020 election, and his campaign is embroiled in legal cases over the extent of his culpability for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. He has vowed to root out opponents like “vermin,” saying they should be “crushed.” And he’s suggested he could use the Justice Department and the FBI to pursue political rivals.",[]

She said authorities were waiting for traces of “yet another Putin's Novichok” to leave his body — referring to the military nerve agent used to poison him years ago. The Kremlin has denied involvement in that poisoning and dismissed suggestions that Putin was behind his death on Friday.Navalnaya vowed to continue her husband's efforts to secure a free Russia.“We know exactly why Putin killed Alexei three days ago. We will tell you soon about it. We will also definitely find out who exactly and how exactly this crime was committed. We will name names and show faces,” she said in the video.“The most important thing we can do for Alexei and for ourselves is to continue to fight,” she added. “I will continue the life work of Alexei Navalny,” Navalnaya said. “I call on you to stand with me.”Russia’s prison authorities said Navalny died suddenly after collapsing following a walk in the remote “Polar Wolf” prison on Friday afternoon. The news sparked outrage, with many international leaders pointing the finger at Putin while Russia's scattered opposition reeled from the loss of one of the Kremlin's fiercest foes. Moscow has derided the West's response and urged the world to wait for the results of an official investigation into his death.But Navalny’s supporters have dismissed the official version of events.

The group were told that the probe into his cause of death had been extended and it was unclear how long it would take, she said.""They were not allowed to go in.

Now, the U.S. is leaning toward sending the longer-range version of the missile, the officials said, which would allow Ukraine to strike farther inside the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula. But U.S. funding for arms shipments to Ukraine remains uncertain because of opposition from former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress. Last week the Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. But it’s not clear whether or when the GOP-controlled House will vote on the measure or whether it would survive the vote.For months, pro-Trump Republicans have said they will approve U.S. military aid to Ukraine only if the Biden administration agrees to a package of GOP immigration and border security measures. Trump and his House and Senate allies this month rejected a bipartisan border security and immigration compromise negotiated by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate.Defense officials told NBC News that the U.S. has a limited inventory of ATACMS and that it is not likely to send them to Ukraine without money to replenish U.S. stockpiles.If Congress approves more funding for Ukraine, the U.S. could include the long-range ATACMS in one of the first packages of military aid paid for with that money, according to the two U.S. officials. The U.S. also has ammunition and artillery ready to send to Ukraine immediately if the funding is approved, the officials added.A Ukrainian serviceman prepares for combat close to Avdiivka in the Donetsk region on Feb. 11.Genya Savilov / AFP - Getty ImagesThe officials did not rule out asking allies to provide the missiles to Ukraine, as well, and replenishing their ATACM stockpiles.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement, a Defense Department spokesperson said: “Without a supplemental [funding bill], we do not currently have a security assistance package to give to Ukraine. At the same time, I won’t speculate on the contents of any future packages if a supplemental were to be passed. We will let you know if this changes and if we have a new package to announce.”Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he spent much of his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Munich on Saturday discussing Ukraine’s need for longer-range weapons.“I just came here from a meeting with Secretary Blinken,” Kuleba told a small group of reporters in Munich on Saturday. “I spent a very good part of the time arguing in favor of ATACMS,” he said, explaining that Ukraine needs the version of the missile that can fly 300 kilometers, or more than 180 miles.“There is only one way to destroy Russian capabilities in Ukraine. It’s to hit deep into the occupied territories, bypassing Russian radio electronic warfare and interceptors,” he said, referring to long-range ATACMS.Kuleba called the systems “an important symbol” to Ukrainians. “If you want to hit behind the lines, disrupt their logistics and supplies, destroy their depots of ammunition, you can do it only with long-range missiles,” he said.The Biden administration has resisted sending the long-range missiles over the past two years because officials worried Ukraine would use them to strike inside Crimea or Russia and cause Russian President Vladimir Putin to escalate the conflict. White House and Pentagon officials have expressed similar concerns about other weapons systems but have now decided to provide them to Ukraine.On Saturday, Kuleba also described an urgent need for more European weapons and assistance for Ukraine, saying many people in Europe are “still reluctant to understand the threat.”“When a citizen of Europe reads in the news that Ukraine retreated from Avdiivka, he should realize one simple fact: Russia has got a few kilometers closer to his own home,” Kuleba said. “Every advance Russia makes in Ukraine brings Russian weapons closer to the home of a middle-class European.”Kuleba praised support from European allies but said they need to speed up production of weapons and ammunition for Ukraine.“It took Europeans too much time to start ramping up or waking up or dusting off their defense industries,” he said. “We will pay with our lives throughout 2024 to give your defense industries time to ramp up production or new lines.”",[]

Navalny remained vocal in his unrelenting criticism of the Kremlin even after surviving a nerve agent poisoning and receiving multiple prison terms.The news reverberated across the globe, and hundreds of people in dozens of Russian cities streamed to ad-hoc memorials and monuments to victims of political repressions with flowers and candles on Friday and Saturday to pay a tribute to the politician. In over a dozen cities, police detained 401 people by Saturday night, according to the OVD-Info rights group that tracks political arrests and provides legal aid.More than 200 arrests were made in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city, the group said. Among those detained there was Grigory Mikhnov-Voitenko, a priest of the Apostolic Orthodox Church — a religious group independent of the Russian Orthodox Church — who announced plans on social media to hold a memorial service for Navalny and was arrested on Saturday morning outside his home. He was charged with organizing a rally and placed in a holding cell in a police precinct, but was later hospitalized with a stroke, OVD-Info reported.Courts in St. Petersburg have ordered 42 of those detained on Friday to serve from one to six days in jail, while nine others were fined, court officials said late on Saturday. In Moscow, at least six people were ordered to serve 15 days in jail, according to OVD-Info. One person was also jailed in the southern city of Krasnodar and two more in the city of Bryansk, the group said.The news of Navalny’s death came a month before a presidential election in Russia that is widely expected to give President Vladimir Putin another six years in power. Questions about the cause of death lingered on Sunday, and it remained unclear when the authorities would release his body to his family.Navalny’s team said Saturday that the politician was “murdered” and accused the authorities of deliberately stalling the release of the body, with Navalny’s mother and lawyers getting contradicting information from various institutions where they went in their quest to retrieve the body. “They’re driving us around in circles and covering their tracks,” Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said on Saturday.“Everything there is covered with cameras in the colony. Every step he took was filmed from all angles all these years. Each employee has a video recorder. In two days, there has been not a single video leaked or published. There is no room for uncertainty here,” Navalny’s closest ally and strategist Leonid Volkov said Sunday.A note handed to Navalny’s mother stated that he died at 2:17 p.m. Friday, according to Yarmysh. Prison officials told his mother when she arrived at the penal colony Saturday that her son had perished from “sudden death syndrome,” Ivan Zhdanov, the director of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service reported that Navalny felt sick after a walk Friday and became unconscious at the penal colony in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow. An ambulance arrived, but he couldn’t be revived, the service said, adding that the cause of death is still “being established.”Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. He has received three prison terms since his arrest, on a number of charges he has rejected as politically motivated.After the last verdict that handed him a 19-year term, Navalny said he understood he was “serving a life sentence, which is measured by the length of my life or the length of life of this regime.”Hours after Navalny’s death was reported, his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, made a dramatic appearance at the Munich Security Conference.She said she was unsure if she could believe the news from official Russian sources, “but if this is true, I want Putin and everyone around Putin, Putin’s friends, his government to know that they will bear responsibility for what they did to our country, to my family and to my husband.”",[]

In a 24-hour span, Ukraine lost 1,500 troops in its unsuccessful defense, it said.The Russian victory in the city means a front line in the war has moved away from the Russian-controlled regional capital of Donetsk, giving Russian fighters greater security from what the ministry described as ""terrorist strikes"" from Ukraine.Ukraine's armed forces commander said earlier Saturday that Ukrainian troops have indeed withdrawn from the battered town, expanding Moscow’s control of Ukraine’s east.The retreat also delivers a victory for President Vladimir Putin as he is about to be re-elected.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the withdrawal was necessary to spare soldiers’ lives.“We are just waiting for more weapons,” Zelenskyy said in Munich, Germany, during a high-profile security conference. “We don’t have long-range weapons, so our main weapon today is our soldiers, our people.”He added that with more air defense systems and long-range weapons, his military could face Russia’s in a fairer fight.Military observers and U.S. officials have warned that a delay in new military aid from Washington, which has been stalled in Congress amid Republican opposition since the fall, was endangering Kyiv’s positions in Avdiivka and elsewhere along the 600-mile front line.Zelenskyy declined to weigh in on the funding fight in the U.S. Congress.Avdiivka marks the most high-profile retreat for Kyiv’s forces since Russia’s capture of another eastern city, Bakhmut, just 30 miles north of Avdiivka, last May. Although the town doesn’t hold great strategic significance, its seizure could add to the mounting pressure on Kyiv to hold its positions amid faltering Western aid and critical ammunition shortages.Zelenskyy has said that with more air defense systems and long-range weapons, his military could face Russia’s in a fairer fight.Vlada Liberova / Libkos / Getty ImagesIt’s also the first major retreat under Col.

Syrskyi was brought in by Zelenskyy in hopes of a “different approach” and to turn things around on the battlefield.“We are taking measures to stabilize the situation and maintain our positions,” Syrskyi said in announcing the withdrawal. He also vowed to return.Ahead of the retreat, Syrskyi’s forces tried to dig in. The country’s military said it was bringing in battle-hardened reinforcements and more ammunition.But an artillery sergeant fighting in the town for several months told NBC News that his unit had faced severe restrictions on how many rounds it could fire daily amid shortages compounded by dwindling human resources.Ukrainian medical personnel treat wounded soldiers near Avdiivka, which is less than 10 miles north of the Russian-controlled regional capital of Donetsk.Elif Kizil / Anadolu via Getty ImagesBattles for Avdiivka, which is less than 10 miles north of Donetsk, have been going on since the beginning of the war but intensified in October after Ukraine’s much-vaunted counteroffensive fizzled out.Earlier this month, Ukraine’s command and the town’s military administration began reporting that Russians were pushing in from all directions and that the situation was becoming critical.The nearly ruined town had a prewar population of 32,000.

""But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.""Putin's admonitions were met with stone faces and tepid applause.""I remember that speech and I remember that the reaction of the  Bush administration, of which I was a part, was to downplay the speculation that this was a declaration of a new war against the West,"" Fried said.

He is just the latest high-profile example of the Kremlin’s approach.“The question was really how long he would survive, rather than whether he would be allowed to live,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.Russia has urged the United States and its allies not to rush to conclusions, criticizing the “rabid” response of those like President Joe Biden who pointed the finger at Putin. But anyone familiar with how the Kremlin operates will have “been left with little doubt” about who was to blame, Giles told NBC News.War in Ukraine and a crackdown at homeRussia has been recast over the past two years, as the Kremlin has waged war in neighboring Ukraine.The war was initially met with some protests inside Russia, but draconian legislation enacted within days of the invasion enabled the arrest of dissenters, many of whom ended up behind bars. Russian independent media fled the country, fearing persecution.The war continues to fuel some dissent at home, with wives of mobilized soldiers fighting to return their men from the front lines, and people lining up to support antiwar candidate Boris Nadezhdin, who was subsequently barred from running in next month’s presidential election.But in reality, most public critics still in Russia have been locked up.Until Friday, Navalny was the most high-profile of these figures, his stoic and humorous presence from an Arctic prison offering opposition supporters an occasional glimpse of the man they might still have hoped to rally around.Navalny was serving a combined 30 ½-year jail sentence when he died.Mladen Antonov / AFP via Getty Images fileThe Kremlin has denied ever poisoning Navalny, and Russian authorities have said his death would be investigated.But his harsh treatment in prison was at best evidence of a “deliberate indifference” from Putin, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the founder and head of the political analysis firm R.Politik.“Russian penal institutions inflict profound and lasting physical and psychological harm on inmates, effectively maiming their lives,” she said in a post on X.Concern will now turn to some of the other high-profile opposition figures imprisoned in recent years.Ilya Yashin, a municipal politician and supporter of Navalny’s, was sentenced to 8 ½ years in late 2022, accused of spreading fake news about Russia’s military in Ukraine, a charge increasingly being used to put Kremlin opponents behind bars. Yashin has been outspoken about the war and critical of Putin’s regime for years.Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., a former journalist and prominent Putin critic who claims he was poisoned twice by the Kremlin, spoke out against the war in Ukraine and lobbied for tougher Western sanctions. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail last April — the harshest sentence imposed on a political opponent since the invasion — on charges including treason that he says are politically motivated. The case drew comparisons to a Stalin-era show trial.Shootings, poison and plane crashesKara-Murza was a close associate of Boris Nemtsov, once considered the leader of Russia’s opposition and one of Putin’s fiercest critics. Nemtsov was shot dead in 2015, just a few feet away from the Kremlin.His murder sent shock waves through Russian society and the opposition scene, with an annual march held in Moscow to mark the killing. Several people were convicted in his murder, but his supporters say those who ordered his killing were never found.",[]

It’s pared-down. It’s airtight. There’s really not a whole lot of area that anyone can criticize on this,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., told reporters before releasing the text. “And it’s bipartisan. It’s the only bipartisan solution in the House.”The $66.3 billion bipartisan package, titled the ""Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act,"" has six initial co-sponsors, equally split between Democrats and Republicans. In addition to Fitzpatrick, the Republican backers are Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York. The Democrats are Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Ed Case of Hawaii and Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez of Washington.The release of the bill comes as the House leaves for a nearly two-week recess. Fitzpatrick is a co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers, but he said the legislation wasn’t a Problem Solvers product.The $66 billion package for the Defense Department calls for $47.7 billion to help defend Ukraine from Russia; $10.4 billion to support the defense of Israel, including funding for the Iron Dome; $4.9 billion to shore up the defense of allies in the Indo-Pacific; and $2.4 billion to back U.S. Central Command operations, including the conflict in the Red Sea.In addition to scaled-back military aid, the package borrows language from the House GOP’s tough border bill, known as H.R. 2, members said.That includes bringing back the “Remain in Mexico” policy for one year, requiring some migrants, including asylum-seekers, to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. President Joe Biden ended the policy, which human rights groups said led migrants to face kidnappings and violence, when he took office, and the Supreme Court upheld the move.But reinstating the border policy would require cooperation from Mexico, which it has rejected. Neither Fitzpatrick nor Bacon could explain how to resolve that dilemma.“That’s something we’ll have to work out,” Bacon said. “I’m not on the foreign — I’m not an ambassador, so I have no idea how they’re going to respond. Our guys want something that makes a difference on the border.”Fitzpatrick said it’ll be the Biden administration’s job to find a way to make Mexico comply.“Well, that’s going to be part of what the administration’s role is in this,” he said. “We’re the legislative branch. The executive branch has to enforce the law.”Fitzpatrick said he doesn’t have a commitment from Johnson to bring the bill to the floor. He said he’d do “whatever it takes” to advance the bill but downplayed the idea of a using a discharge petition — a tool to bypass leadership and force a vote — instead suggesting a “queen of the hill” rule in which many bills can get votes and the one with the largest number of votes is adopted.“We have to talk to leadership or both parties and hopefully they’ll support it,"" he said, adding that he doesn’t have a firm timeline.""I think this is a good spot to be if you’re Republican,"" said Bacon, a swing-district lawmaker who worked with Fitzpatrick to craft the bill. ""You’re reducing the Senate bill by about 30%. So it’s fiscally more responsible. We know we got to do military aid to Ukraine or they’re going to fall, and it’ll cost us more if that happens. And we can deal with the border. So I just feel good about what we’re doing.”House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who supports Ukraine aid, said there won't be a discharge petition to bring it to the floor.“No. That’d be a nuclear option,” McCaul said. “Taking away the speaker’s power would backfire. A lot of Republicans that would vote for Ukraine would not if that happens.""But Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has threatened to force a vote to overthrow Johnson if he puts a Ukraine funding bill on the floor, said the moderates' bill is all but dead.“I’ll assure you: Ukraine aid is not coming to the floor,” she said Thursday in an interview.Unlike the Senate package, which passed 70-29, the House bill doesn’t include any humanitarian aid for those affected by war in Gaza, Ukraine and other hot spots; the aid would be solely for military needs.But Fitzpatrick said lawmakers are free to try to change the legislation through the amendment process.“We can open up to amendments and everybody can get their votes and let the House do its will,"" he said.",[]

They were welcomed by Trump but dismissed by the White House, which urged Putin to “stay out” of the election.In an interview with Russian propagandist reporter Pavel Zarubin released Wednesday night, Putin did not hesitate when asked whether Biden or Trump was better for Russia.“Biden,” Putin said. “He is a more experienced, predictable person, an old-school politician.”But, he added, Moscow will work with any U.S. leader who has the trust of the American people.The video of the interview was shared by Zarubin on his Telegram channel, and the transcript of Putin’s comments was published on the Kremlin’s website.In the interview, Putin also touched on speculation around Biden’s mental fitness, saying he did not have the right to comment on the issue but that he did not notice anything out of the ordinary during the leaders’ meeting in Geneva in 2021.“People were already saying then that he wasn’t up to it. I didn’t see anything of the kind,” Putin said.The White House responded to the Russian leader’s intervention Thursday morning. “Mr. Putin should stay out of America’s elections,” said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates.Biden has long been open in his criticism of Putin, previously calling the Russian leader a “killer,” “murderous dictator” and “pure thug.” He spearheaded the Western response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, including tough economic sanctions.The U.S. has also been supplying Ukraine’s military with billions of dollars in crucial supplies, and Putin’s intervention comes as the White House pushes the GOP-led House to vote through a new package of aid for Kyiv.Trump, in contrast, has often been complimentary of Putin and praised him as a tough leader. A Senate intelligence report found “extensive” Russian interference in the 2016 election that Trump won.The former president set off alarm bells in Europe after telling an election rally last weekend that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” if it attacked a NATO country that didn’t pay enough for defense.The Republican front-runner stood by his comments at a rally on Wednesday night. He also responded to Putin’s stated preference for Biden, calling it a “great compliment” and adding that “Putin is not a fan of mine.”Putin has previously blamed NATO and the bloc’s expansion to the east for ultimately precipitating his attack on Ukraine. Biden has pledged staunch support for America’s NATO allies and accused Trump on Tuesday of having “bowed down to a Russian dictator.”Putin said in the interview that Trump has always been perceived as a “non-systemic politician” with “his own view” on how the U.S. should develop relations with allies.A week earlier, in a much talked-about interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Putin said he had “a personal relationship” with Trump, but could not remember the last time he talked to Biden. “It’s not about the personality of the leader — it’s about the mood of the elites,” Putin said when asked whether it matters who is in charge in Washington for better relations with Russia.Addressing the interview with Carlson, Putin said Wednesday that he was surprised by the lack of “sharp questions” from the conservative commentator.He said he expected Carlson to be more “aggressive” and interrupt him more, so that he could respond more pointedly. Carlson did not press Putin on many issues sensitive for the Kremlin, including a crackdown on dissent or alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.“Frankly speaking, I did not fully enjoy this interview,” Putin said.",[]

It said the ship can carry 87 crew members.Sinking the vessel would be another embarrassing blow for the Russian Black Sea fleet and a significant success for Ukraine 10 days before the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.Ukraine has moved onto the defensive in the war, hindered by low ammunition supplies and a shortage of personnel, but has kept up its strikes behind the largely static 930-mile front line.It is the second time in two weeks that Ukrainian forces have said they sank a Russian vessel in the Black Sea. Last week, they published a video that they said showed naval drones assaulting the Russian missile-armed corvette Ivanovets.Ukraine’s military intelligence, known by its Ukrainian acronym, GUR, said its special operations unit “Group 13” sank the Caesar Kunikov using Magura V5 sea drones on Wednesday, damaging the vessel on its left side. The same unit also struck on Feb. 1, according to officials.Ukrainian attacks on Russian aircraft and ships in the Black Sea have helped push Moscow’s naval forces back from the coast, allowing Kyiv to increase crucial exports of grain and other goods through its southern ports.A new generation of unmanned weapons systems has become a centerpiece of the war, both at sea and on land.The Magura V5 drone, which looks like a sleek black speedboat, was unveiled last year. It reportedly has a top speed of 42 knots (50 mph) and a payload of 700 pounds.The Russian military did not immediately comment on the claimed sinking, saying only that it downed six Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea overnight.Caesar Kunikov, for whom the Russian vessel was named, was a World War II hero of the Soviet Union for his exploits and died on Feb. 14, the same day as the Ukrainian drone strike, in 1943.",[]

Even Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, acknowledged that if the bill were put on the floor, “it would pass — let’s just be frank about that.”But that scenario is extremely unlikely in the House, where GOP support for Ukraine continues to wane. Asked Tuesday whether he would put the aid package on the floor as is, Johnson threw cold water on it. “National security begins with border security,” he replied.And, to make matters more complicated for Johnson, any member can trigger a vote to oust him from the job, as happened to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in October after McCarthy worked across the aisle to keep the government open.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has already threatened Johnson with a “motion to vacate” should he put any aid for Ukraine on the floor.“I just told him it’s an absolute no-go,” Greene told reporters of their private conversation last month. “If he funds $60 billion to fund a war in Ukraine to continue killing a whole generation of Ukrainian men, to continue a war that is a losing war ... yeah, I would introduce the motion to vacate myself.”Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who rarely weighs in publicly on the House process, has urged Johnson to take up the bill. The two met privately Thursday moments before Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., moved ahead on the border-less national security package last week.“History settles every account,” McConnell said in a statement released shortly after the Senate’s vote. “And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.”Splitting the packageAnother idea that has been kicking around the Capitol is to split the Ukraine and Israel aid into two bills, try to pass them separately, then possibly repackage them together and send them back to the Senate.It’s a procedural tool — dubbed “dividing the question” — that Nancy Pelosi and other past speakers have used when they’ve needed to pass politically complicated legislation. Johnson communicated his likely intention to proceed with that option at a private meeting last week with Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is an ally of Johnson’s.Dividing the aid package in two would allow one bipartisan coalition of lawmakers — Republicans and most Democrats — to pass the Israel aid and another coalition — Democrats and more hawkish Republicans — to pass the Ukraine measure. Many conservatives have opposed passing additional Ukraine aid, while many progressives have protested sending more money to Israel as it carries out a deadly military campaign in Gaza.  But that option faces a huge challenge, as well. To divide the question, the House Rules Committee would need to sign off first. Just a handful of conservatives on the GOP-led committee, who are likely to oppose that plan, would have the power to derail it if Democrats teamed up with them.There’s also a question of whether Democrats would agree to help Republicans pass such a rule on the House floor; the minority party typically opposes rule votes, which are first steps to passing most legislation, except in rare circumstances.Bringing only Israel or Ukraine aid to the floor without the other would fail. Last week, a $17.6 billion Israel stand-alone aid bill failed; most Democrats opposed it because it lacked funding for Ukraine.Forcing a vote with a ‘discharge petition’Some moderate members in both parties have floated a “discharge petition” as a way to bypass Johnson’s leadership team entirely and force a vote on the Senate-passed bill. It’s a rarely used tool, in large part because it requires 218 signatures — a majority of the full chamber — to force a vote. A handful of Republicans would need to join all Democrats for the procedural tactic to succeed.“I’d certainly oppose it, and I hope that it would not be considered,” Johnson replied when he was asked about a potential discharge petition. “There’s a deliberative process, and we’re engaged in that, and we’ll see how it goes.”At a news conference Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said that “all options are on the table” in reference to the discharge petition and that Democratic leaders would soon begin to have those conversations in earnest.“It’s not too much to ask in the interest of America’s national security that we get an up-or-down vote and let the House of Representatives actually work its will,” Jeffries said, “as opposed to allowing Donald Trump to work his will and block our national security priorities.”The last time a discharge petition was used successfully was in 2015, when Democrats joined Republicans to force a vote on reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank under Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who had just announced his retirement from Congress.Adding the aid to must-pass government fundingDeadlines to fund the government and avert a government shutdown are quickly approaching on March 1 and March 8. Must-pass funding bills could present opportunities for the aid package to hitch a ride as part of a larger deal between Democrats and Republicans.But that still wouldn’t satisfy GOP demands to pair foreign aid with tougher border security provisions. And Republicans are eyeing the possibility of attaching aid to funding measures with a heavy dose of skepticism.Schumer’s “usual tactic is to find something that must pass and cram as much stuff into it and push it across the finish line, but I think with a House with just a very thin margin of Republicans, that’s not going to work,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a former GOP whip. “So I think he is setting us up for a yearlong continuing resolution and an unknown fate, really,” for the Ukraine and Israel aid bill.Attaching the House’s own border billJohnson and House Republicans have long insisted that any border deal must include the principles in the border enforcement bill they passed last year, known as the Secure the Border Act, or H.R. 2. The bill would bolster the Customs and Border Protection workforce, upgrade technology at the border, require the homeland security secretary to resume construction of the border wall and limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum, among other things. The Senate, under Democratic control, never took up the bill.When a group of senators this month unveiled their bipartisan bill, which included border security, House Republican leadership panned it as insufficient and demanded the Senate take up H.R. 2 instead.“That bill contains the necessary components to actually stem the flow of illegals and end the present crisis,” Johnson and his leadership team said in a joint statement.House Republicans could vote to attach H.R. 2 to the national security supplemental measure to punt the issue back to their counterparts in the Senate — where it would be a nonstarter with Democrats.Doing nothingOf course, Johnson could choose to ignore the aid bills to Ukraine and Israel altogether.In contrast with his time as a rank-and-file member of Congress, as speaker, Johnson has indicated that he supports sending lethal assistance to Kyiv but not economic aid, which the Senate-passed bill includes.And there is also significant support among House Republicans to fund Israel’s war against Hamas, an issue the Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn’t split off from aid to Ukraine.Administration officials warned key lawmakers, including Johnson, in a high-stakes White House meeting with President Joe Biden last month that Ukraine could lose the war in a matter of weeks without additional support from the U.S.On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Senate passage of the package, with no mention of the uphill battle it faces in the House.“American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world,” he posted on X.Some lawmakers, desperate to pass foreign aid as soon as possible, have even considered out-of-the-box measures like temporarily replacing Johnson with a moderate Republican speaker.“Only four House Republicans are needed to elect a new speaker,” Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., said on the House floor Tuesday. “If Mike Johnson fails to act, I believe there are many Republicans in the House who agree with the 22 Republicans in the Senate on this issue.”",[]

Her fight may finally be over this week — a few months shy of her twin boys’ 17th birthday.Greek lawmakers are expected to legalize same-sex marriage in a parliament vote Thursday, with a rare display of cross-party collaboration.Approval would make Greece the first Orthodox Christian country to take that step, clearing multiple legal hurdles for gay couples who already have or want to have children.“I’ve been fighting for this ever since I figured out who I was,” says Belia, a 57-year-old drama teacher with a gruff voice and an easy laugh.“And it’s a great relief to say we’ve finally made it,” she said. “But it is tiresome, very tiresome to fight for something that’s an obvious right — to suffer for something that other people are just handed — and have to fight so hard to get it.”Belia split with her female partner when her sons were aged 11 but she considers her to be the boys’ other mother.Although civil partnerships were extended to gay couples in Greece nearly a decade ago, only the biological parents of children in those relationships are currently recognized as legal guardians.The issue of children’s rights, including the publicized plight of cancer survivors in a same-sex relationship, helped nudge public opinion toward narrowly favoring the bill that was sponsored by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ conservative government.But it also triggered a strong reaction from the country’s Orthodox Church. Representing Greece’s dominant faith, the Church argues the marriage bill would confuse parental roles and weaken the traditional family.The Church petitioned lawmakers to reconsider in a public appeal also read out at Sunday services.Several prominent bishops have taken a tougher line, warning that they will refuse to baptize the children of gay couples. They allied with far-right political parties and traditionalist groups to stage public demonstrations.Protester Chara Giannakantonaki said she felt compelled to attend a rally held in front of parliament last Sunday.“Every minority already has its rights guaranteed. There is no issue. They don’t need (same-sex) marriage. They just want to desecrate whatever has remained sacred in Greece: Our Church, our families and our children,” she said. “But children are a red line and we will never accept this.”The Mitsotakis government is facing dissent among conservatives over the bill and will need support from the centrist and left-wing opposition to secure the 151-vote minimum in the 300-member parliament.Dimitris Mavros, managing director of the market research firm MRB Hellas, said the timing of the bill appeared to be carefully calculated: Backing a measure that props up Mitsotakis’ centrist credentials but with the controversy likely to blow over before the European Union-wide elections in June.Greeks in 2024, Mavros said, have shown a sharp rise in financial anxiety, their worries reflected in recent strikes and ongoing farmers’ protests.“I think the farmers’ (protests) and high prices — and issues that hurt people’s pockets — are going to overshadow the same-sex couples issue,” he said. “We’re probably going to get past this calmly.”Chrysa Gkotsopoulou and Elena Kotsifi, both engineers, for years told their families and colleagues they were roommates and only came out as a couple after moving to England for work in 2015.They now have a young daughter, Ariadne, and all three travel to Greece using their U.K. passports.“We quickly realized that England offered us prospects as a couple that we had never previously imagined.” Kotsifi, 38, said. “We could be ourselves.”They flew to Athens at the weekend to celebrate the bill’s expected approval, and said that for the first time in nearly a decade, they now view returning home as a possibility.They hope to join the activist Belia and others Thursday night in the public gallery in parliament and celebrations set to follow.“If there’s room for us (in parliament), we’d like to go,” Gkotsopoulou said. “We feel joy, joy and pride that Greece is moving to the right side of history.”",[]

Twenty-two Senate Republicans voted for the package, as did 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats.Twenty-six Republicans and two Democrats — Peter Welch of Vermont and Jeff Merkley of Oregon — voted no. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, also voted against it.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., lauded passage of the bill in remarks on the Senate floor after the vote. He later told reporters he hopes to speak directly with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and urge him ""to step up to the moment and do the right thing.""“If we want the world to remain a safe place for freedom, for democratic principles, and for our future prosperity, then America must lead the way,” Schumer said on the floor. “And with this bill, the Senate declares that American leadership will not waver, not falter, not fail.”The Senate’s action would make Russian President Vladimir Putin “regret the day he questioned America’s resolve,"" Schumer said. ""And we send a clear bipartisan message of resolve to our allies in NATO."" Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said U.S. ""adversaries want America to decide that reinforcing allies and partners is not in our interest and that investing in strategic competition is not worth it. They want us to take hard-earned credibility and light it on fire.""“But today, the Senate responded by reaffirming a commitment to rebuild and modernize our military, restore our credibility, and give the current commander in chief, as well as the next, more tools to secure our interests,"" he continued.The Senate's vote to pass the foreign aid bill is a significant step forward after months of delays centered on whether tough border security measures would be part of the package. Although Republicans demanded that any bill to authorize aid to Ukraine also address the crisis at the border, they ultimately killed a bipartisan package that married those issues.The emergency aid bill now faces an uncertain fate in the GOP-controlled House, where conservatives are pressuring Johnson to block funds for war-torn Ukraine until America’s southern border is secure. Hours before the vote, Johnson made clear he would not bring the Senate security package to the House floor.The Senate ""should have gone back to the drawing board to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help end the ongoing catastrophe. Instead, the Senate’s foreign aid bill is silent on the most pressing issue facing our country,"" Johnson said in a statement.""Now, in the absence of having received any single border policy change from the Senate, the House will have to continue to work its own will on these important matters,"" he added.In an emotional floor speech and in an interview with reporters, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., pushed back against GOP colleagues who opposed the bill and have argued that Washington needs to focus on protecting America's borders before those of foreign allies.""This is not about taking care of others. I certainly care about the people in Ukraine and their freedom or the people in Israel and what they suffered. ... But this is, first and foremost, an issue about protecting Americans,"" Moran told reporters Monday evening.""My point is that when we focus on the world, we're also focusing on America,"" he said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the senators for their support in a message on Telegram, saying the U.S. aid ""helps to save human lives from Russian terror. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war.""""American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world,"" Zelenskyy said.The Senate-passed package calls for $95.34 billion in aid, including $60.06 billion to help protect Ukraine against the Russian invasion; $14.1 billion in security assistance for Israel; $9.15 billion in humanitarian assistance to provide things such as food, water and  medical care to affected civilians in Gaza, the West Bank, Ukraine and other hot spots; and $4.83 billion to support allies in the Indo-Pacific and deter aggression by the Chinese government.Initially, Senate leaders had hoped to move forward with a foreign aid package that included stricter asylum and border security provisions that was negotiated by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,  James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.But GOP leaders ditched that strategy after former President Donald Trump and top House GOP leaders objected to the bipartisan border deal, saying it would not go far enough to stop the influx in illegal crossings at the southern border. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked the combined border and foreign aid package, forcing the leadership to fall back to Plan B: abandon the border deal and try to push through the stand-alone aid package.But then, Senate conservatives objected to moving forward with the aid package without attaching border security provisions. Among them was Rand Paul, R-Ky., who tried to slow the new bill’s progress at every step.“I think we should tackle our problems here first,"" Paul told reporters over the weekend as he delayed the passage. ""A sizable chunk of the Republican caucus said we should have border security on this bill, and our leadership gave in, and our leadership said, basically, the Ukrainian border is more important than our southern border, and I disagree with that.”McConnell, Kentucky's other senator and a longtime defense hawk, was on the other side of that argument. Speaking on the floor in a rare Senate session Sunday, McConnell criticized those in his conference who have objected to sending additional aid to Ukraine, saying they have “the dimmest and most shortsighted views of our obligations.” “I know it’s become quite fashionable in some circles to disregard the global interests we have as a global power. To bemoan the responsibilities of global leadership. To lament the commitment that has underpinned the longest drought of great power conflict in human history,” McConnell said.“This is the idle work for idle minds — and it has no place in the United States Senate,” he said.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., one of the 22 Republicans who voted yes, told reporters that failing to pass the foreign aid would send “a bad message” to allies.

While independent Russian news outlet Mediazona first reported Tuesday that Kallas was on the list, it said she has been on it for a while. The list includes scores of officials and lawmakers from other Baltic nations.Kallas responded to the move Tuesday, saying it was ""nothing surprising.""In a post on X, she added: ""This is yet more proof that I am doing the right thing — the #EU’s strong support to #Ukraine is a success and it hurts Russia.""The move was related to her efforts to remove World War II monuments, other Russian officials said.

But “we have to have enough deterrence of our own so we’re not caught with our trousers down.”Trump meets Stoltenberg in Brussels in 2018.Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP fileThe renewed concern comes after Trump told a rally in South Carolina on Saturday that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to any NATO country that didn’t pay enough for defense.The European rebuke to Trump’s latest remarks has been swift.Stoltenberg said it “undermines all of our security” and “puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.” The “reckless” statement would “serve only Putin’s interest,” Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.While the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, said that “NATO cannot be an ‘a la carte’ military alliance” that “depended on the humor of the president of the U.S.”Ben Hodges, former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, told NBC News that it was “disgusting and despicable that a former American president, and now a presidential candidate, would say something that is so dangerous for American security, as well as the security of our allies.”This is not new territory for Trump, who repeatedly criticized the postwar military alliance during his first term. But it’s nonetheless an ultimatum that threatens to upend the entire postwar security arrangement between the U.S. and Europe.Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty has always been taken to mean that if a smaller European nation was attacked by Russia, then the U.S. and all the other allies would come to that country’s defense. It’s an all-for-one-and-one-for-all pact that supporters say has a track record of deterring a world war with the former Soviet Union and more recently Putin. Trump’s central criticism is that some NATO countries — including economic big hitters such as Germany — do not pay the agreed 2% of their gross domestic product toward defense.Trump took credit for a rise in this spending during his first term, although in reality the increase began in 2014 after Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula. He has often mischaracterized this spending arrangement, implying that these countries “owe” the U.S., when in fact NATO’s 2% agreement is only about each country’s domestic defense spending.Ukraine is not in NATO but wants to join. Some experts believe the alliance's reluctance to give it membership is one of the reasons Russia felt confident enough to invade.Roberto Schmidt / Getty ImagesMany presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, have also urged the European nations to up their defense budgets. But most have done so in private, and none have come close to Trump’s blunt quid pro quo. Trump’s outraged critics say that even the threat of reneging on NATO’s central promise could see Putin attack a smaller Eastern European country, if the Russian president thought there was a good chance Washington might not send the cavalry.“Article 5 is a poker game: It’s about making the other player, Russia, believe that you have a stronger hand than them, and that you will respond,” Pothier said. “What Trump is doing is creating some ambiguity and doubt” about the strength of the Europeans’ hand, he added.But as horrified as most mainstream voices are, there are also plenty of supporters who concede that part of Trump’s argument is correct: European nations have for too long been overly reliant on American protection — and it’s time they stood up for themselves by spending more on defense.The front-runner for NATO’s top job, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, said that Trump “was right” in demanding European countries pay more for defense. “We have to dance with whoever is on the dance floor,” he said when asked about the prospect of a second Trump term in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.Stoltenberg made similar comments during Trump’s first term. This was seen by some observers as partly an attempt to manage a wild-card president with whom he was forced to work — but he argued the point no less vehemently.“More money for defense will enable us to invest more in production of ammunition, which is extremely critical,” he said in a speech in September, adding that “I welcome the efforts.”Britain and France do have small nuclear arsenals, but these are dwarfed by both that of the U.S. and Russia. Meanwhile Europe’s conventional military forces are well equipped to deal with smaller, asymmetric conflicts, such as France’s ongoing counterinsurgency operation in Africa’s Sahel region. But they do simply not have the might to respond to Putin without the U.S., Pothier said.“That’s the paradox of Europe,” he said. “It does not have the density of forces to hold the line against a major land invasion on the European continent. That’s the big gap, and it’s problematic.”",[]

The bill is set for a vote in parliament in days.Greece’s conservative government is sponsoring the bill but it will require votes from center and left opposition parties to be approved. However, even some center-left lawmakers have gone on record as opposing the bill.Organizers of Sunday’s rally — religious groups — described the bill as a threat to the traditional family. Many of the protesters chanted “hands off our children.”“Unfortunately, the woke agenda has also reached Greece and that agenda includes the marriage of homosexuals,” Dimitris Natsios, leader of the far-right and strongly religious Niki party said.“Greece is a Christian Orthodox country and our tradition does not allow this. ... We know and respect one type of marriage: The Orthodox Christian wedding. Our Constitution also does not provide for this, so this bill is unconstitutional and runs counter to our faith in Christ,” Natsios said.The Niki party, founded in 2019, entered Parliament in 2023. In the most recent election, in June, it came in sixth, with 3.70% of the vote and elected 10 lawmakers to the 300-member assembly.Many same-sex couples in Greece seeking to start a family currently get married in countries where same-sex weddings are legal.Greece has legalized “cohabitation contracts” for same-sex couples since December 2015.

The comments will do little to ease concerns in Europe about U.S. dependability, with military aid that Ukraine desperately needs held up in Congress and the front-runner for the GOP nomination now reiterating his long-standing skepticism of America’s historical commitments to its allies.Speaking to supporters at a rally in South Carolina, Trump recounted an exchange from his time in office with the leader of a “big country” who asked whether it would be protected if Russia attacked.Trump said he told the leader that the U.S. government would not protect the bloc if it didn’t pay its fair share in defense spending.“I said: ‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’” Trump recalled. “No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.”The White House said Trump’s latest comments were “appalling and unhinged.”“Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged — and it endangers American national security, global stability and our economy at home,” spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement Saturday night.“Rather than calling for wars and promoting deranged chaos, President Biden will continue to bolster American leadership and stand up for our national security interests — not against them,” he said.Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told NBC News: “Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden. President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer. When you don’t pay your defense spending you can’t be surprised that you get more war.”NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance “remains ready and able to defend all allies. Any attack on NATO will be met with a united and forceful response.""Stoltenberg cautioned that ""any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.""But he added: ""I expect that regardless of who wins the presidential election the U.S. will remain a strong and committed NATO ally.”Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz also criticized Trump.“NATO’s motto ‘one for all, all for one’ is a concrete commitment. Undermining the credibility of allied countries means weakening the entire NATO,” he wrote on X. “No election campaign is an excuse for playing with the security of the alliance.”Russian President Vladimir Putin is pushing on with his war in Ukraine, and some NATO members have expressed concerns that Russia might look to invade other countries next.The alliance was formed in 1949 to provide collective defense against the Soviet Union. A hallmark of the agreement is Article 5, which states that an attack on one ally would be considered an attack on all.Trump has long groused about NATO and sparred with heads of member states, reportedly threatening to pull the U.S. out of the bloc over demands that member nations hit the target of spending 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.Since he came into office, President Joe Biden has sought to reassure NATO of the U.S. commitment to the alliance, a stark contrast to his Republican predecessor.Last month, Biden signed an $886 billion defense bill that bars a president from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO, which could thwart Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to “fundamentally” re-evaluate “NATO’s purpose and NATO’s mission.”A report released last year showed only 11 of the then-30 member nations were spending 2% of their GDP or more on defense. But the figure is a target, not a requirement, and many NATO members have stepped up their military spending in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Finland was granted NATO membership status last year, and Sweden is in the process of joining. Denmark’s defense minister warned Friday that a new threat assessment based on new intelligence indicates that Russia could attack a NATO country within three to five years.Besides the NATO comment, Trump on Saturday also boasted about the recent failure to pass a bipartisan border deal.“We crushed crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous border deal. Mike Johnson did a very good job,” Trump said, referring to the Republican House speaker and his opposition to the bill.It was widely reported that Trump wanted his party to reject the legislation in hope that he could use the crisis at the southern border as a political tool to win re-election in November.But the clash in Washington has meant that new military aid to Ukraine remains held up, hampering Kyiv’s fight against the Kremlin’s forces at a crucial moment on the battlefield.His stated ambivalence toward Russian aggression has long fueled concerns in Ukraine and beyond about what a second Trump presidency would mean for Europe.A high-level European Union official said last month that Trump had told top European officials while he was in office that the U.S. would never help Europe if it came under attack.“The real problem is whether Trump is looking to stabilize onto a rebalanced relationship, but one where we remain trusted allies nonetheless, or whether this is directional, i.e., part of a steady and deliberate erosion of our relationship, with rupture as the final destination,” said Edward Hunter Christie, a former NATO official and senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.“It would be more reasonable to assume that Trump is preparing the ground for abandoning Europe and for striking deals with Russia over our heads,” he said Saturday on X.",[]

It credited Mexican authorities, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the office's own fugitive task force for the arrest.""He set a plan in motion to flee to a foreign country in yet another attempt to escape the consequences of his actions,"" Spitzer said in his office's statement Wednesday.The public defender's office, which has been assigned to defend Souzer in the past, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The DA's office acknowledged that a family member said during his juvenile court prosecution for manslaughter that Souzer was autistic and had a history of outbursts.The DA's office said Souzer has a long history of crime and that when he attacked his mother, he was on home detainment and wearing a GPS monitor for another matter.The office said Souzer violated probation when he left the supervision of the same transitional organization in 2022, when he was under mandatory GPS monitoring for the weapons conviction. The DA's task force found Souzer at the time at a homeless encampment, according to the statement on Wednesday.Spitzer blamed judges in the county for issuing what he described as lax sentences in cases involving Souzer. The office wanted to try him as an adult in the death of his mother, it said, and it consistently asked for stricter sentences in his subsequent cases.In those matters, judges allowed time served to be counted and gave Souzer credit for good behavior, according to the DA's office. The office called out specific judges by name. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Erica R. Yew, speaking as president of the California Judges Association, said state law generally favors treatment and rehabilitation over long sentences, which she said can lead to a ""revolving door"" of incarceration.""Judges do their best to exercise their discretion to strike the right balance,"" she said by email. ""It is easy to criticize when one does not carry the weight of these extremely challenging decisions. And such criticism fails to appreciate the excellent work done by judges day in and day out for hundreds of Californians accessing justice in our courts.""The DA's office also appeared to criticize a nonprofit, Project Kinship, for having ""spent years advocating for Souzer’s release from custody.""The nonprofit organization runs the supervisory program and transitional facility from which Souzer left in 2022 and on March 20. It said it couldn’t comment on specific cases.Founder and executive director Steve Kim said by email, ""Project Kinship offers services like case management, counseling, and peer mentorship. We help individuals impacted by substance abuse, gangs, and incarceration.""He said it has had a positive influence on Orange County.""Personally, I have not yet met an inherently evil person in our work — just lives shattered by trauma and mental health challenges, often leading to a loss of hope,"" he said.

The lawsuit alleged Lizzo created a hostile work environment and sexually harassed employees, which the singer has denied. She is also facing another lawsuit from another former employee who alleges Lizzo allowed bullying, harassment and racial discrimination on her team.In her March 29 statement, the singer went on to say she is tired of “being the butt of the joke every single time because of how I look... my character being picked apart by people who don’t know me and disrespecting my name.“I didn’t sign up for this s---,” she concluded. “I QUIT.”Lizzo’s team did not immediately respond to TODAY.com’s request for comment.Lizzo, whose birth name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, has been in the headlines recently for her political activity and her clothing line, Yitty.On Thursday, Lizzo participated in a fundraiser for President Joe Biden in New York City alongside a slew of other celebrities and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at Radio City Music Hall.Lizzo changes course on body positivityIn an interview published days ago by the New York Times about her clothing brand Yitty’s new shapewear-influenced swimwear line, Lizzo did not seem to indicate that she was planning on leaving either the clothing or music industry and declined to discuss the ongoing lawsuit.She touted Yitty’s new line and opened up about her weight, however, revealing that she has been “methodical, losing weight very slowly.”She noted that because she is not currently touring, she has more time for self-care.“I’m taking the time every day to put some love into my body,” she told the Times. “There is never a day when I regret taking a walk or doing some Pilates.”She added that how she feels about her body “changes every single day.”“I’m not going to lie and say I love my body every day,” she told the outlet. “There are some days I adore my body, and others when I don’t feel completely positive.”Once a perceived champion of body positivity, she also revealed to the Times that she is more about “body neutrality” these days.“The idea of body positivity, it’s moved away from the antiquated mainstream conception,” she said. “It’s evolved into body neutrality.”Where does the lawsuit with three of her former backup dancers stand?Three of Lizzo’s former backup dancers — Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez — filed a lawsuit in August 2023 alleging that the singer created a hostile work environment and sexually harassed her employees.Lizzo denied all allegations against her in the suit, calling them “false,” “unbelievable” and “outrageous.”The dancers’ lawsuit also named dance captain Shirlene Quigley and Lizzo’s production company, Big Grrrl Big Touring, Inc., as defendants, and alleged Quigley proselytized to the dancers and shamed those who had engaged in premarital sex.Quigley called the accusations “baseless” and wrote in a February Instagram post that “in due time the truth will come out and I look forward to speaking that truth at the appropriate time.”In February 2024, a judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court denied the singer’s request to throw out the backup dancers’ lawsuit. Judge Mark H. Epstein did elect to toss out some of the plaintiffs’ accusations against Lizzo and her team, including that Lizzo fat-shamed one of her dancers.A spokesperson for Lizzo, Stefan Friedman, said in a statement at the time that the team is “pleased” that Epstein chose to throw out “all or part of four of the plaintiffs’ causes of action.”“Lizzo is grateful to the judge for seeing through much of the noise and recognizing who she is — a strong woman who exists to lift others up and spread positivity,” Friedman said. “We plan to appeal all elements that the judge chose to keep in the lawsuit and are confident we will prevail.”Fashion designer also sues LizzoLizzo is also facing another lawsuit filed by a former employee, fashion designer Asha Daniels.In the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in September 2023, Daniels says the musician allowed bullying, harassment and racial discrimination on her tour.Daniels said in her lawsuit that wardrobe manager Amanda Nomura did offensive stereotypical impressions of Black women, referred to the performers as “fat,” “useless” and “dumb,” and forced them to change in front of a mostly white, male stage crew who would “lewdly gawk” at them. NBC News’ attempts to reach Nomura for comment when the lawsuit was filed were unsuccessful.Friedman, Lizzo’s spokesperson, told NBC News at the time of the filing that Daniels’ lawsuit was a “bogus, absurd publicity-stunt lawsuit” from someone who “never actually met or even spoke with Lizzo.” “We will pay this as much attention as it deserves,” the statement read. “None.”That lawsuit remains ongoing.",[]

This money, awarded across more than 132 communities, will be used to reconnect communities by “removing, retrofitting, or mitigating highways,” according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.A spokesperson for the Federal Highway Administration told NBC News in a statement that it is working with states and communities to invest in safer and cleaner modes of transportation, like walking and biking.“We are dedicating billions of dollars to plan and build locally-driven solutions to redesign roads, addressing inequities to better meet the needs of all community members and building a more equitable transportation system,” the FHWA said.According to a paper published last month in the Journal of Transport Geography, transportation accounts for 23% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and 70% of those emissions come from road vehicles.Some members of Congress seek to address the environmental harm caused by highways. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., introduced a bill in February that aims to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions on the national highway system by creating incentives for reducing vehicle miles traveled.“It’s urgent because our national highway system is a major contributor to the climate crisis,” Huffman told NBC News. “And the only way we’re going to change that is to reform the priorities we invest in.”He said the U.S. is “way behind” other countries in terms of these investment priorities.“Just travel to Europe or other places that have done good planning and you can see just how terribly vehicle-oriented we have been for the past century, and so we’re playing catch-up,” he said.His Democratic colleague, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who originally reintroduced the GREEN Streets Act back in January, put it more bluntly.“For the last 100 years, we’ve prioritized … gas-guzzling, low-occupancy vehicles on highways. This car-centric approach not only accelerates the climate crisis, but also makes our roads less safe while exacerbating racial and economic inequality,” he said in a statement to NBC News.“My GREEN Streets Act aims to tackle these issues by requiring states to meet carbon emission reduction goals and invest in cleaner, safer infrastructure,” he said.Even these proposals, though, assume not only the existence but the necessity of America’s continued reliance on highways.That’s in stark contrast to Canada, for instance, whose environmental minister announced last month that the country will no longer fund road expansion projects, choosing instead to focus investments on more active modes of transportation like walking and cycling.“There will be no more envelopes from the federal government to enlarge the road network,” Steven Guilbeault told the Montreal Gazette.He said that money would be “better invested into projects that will help fight climate change and adapt to its impacts.”The announcement falls in line with efforts in other countries to move away from car-dependent infrastructure in order to combat climate change.Last month, Parisians voted to triple parking charges for large SUVs, and the city has added more than 50 miles of bike lanes since 2020.“We’re proud of having posed an eminently environmental question at a time the environment is presented as the source of all evil,” Mayor Anne Hidalgo said after the referendum.Later this year, Dublin plans to phase out through traffic in its city center in order to help meet emissions goals and unclog the downtown area.“By reorienting the City Centre towards sustainable transport modes,” a draft of the City Centre Transport Plan states, Dublin will be able to help “achieve the national objective to reduce emissions from transport by 50% in accordance with the 2023 Climate Action Plan.”David Zipper, senior fellow at the MIT Mobility Initiative, said similar reforms are difficult and taboo in the U.S. due in part to policy inertia.“We’ve spent 100 years building roads at the federal level and funding states to do the same, so that’s what state officials and the public expect to keep happening, even if it’s not useful and devastating to the environment,” he said.There’s also a psychological component, he said. A lot of people and policymakers genuinely believe that expanding highways and roads will ease frustrating congestion issues in their area.But that’s not necessarily the case, Zipper said, citing the theory of induced demand, which explains why adding more car lanes tends to increase, rather than decrease, traffic by incentivizing more people to drive.He said the U.S. needs to stop expanding highways and start massively investing in greener alternatives if it wants to be serious about addressing climate change.“If we’re serious about reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, we have to be serious about reducing transportation emissions, and in order to do that we have to address the main source of those emissions, which come from cars and trucks on highways,” he said.“And to that extent, we need to rethink how much we want to expand highways.”",[]

I was on no medication at all on a regular basis,” Gibbon, of Santa Monica, California, told NBC News.When he developed a cough and then lost weight, Gibbon got a chest X-ray and CT scan of his lungs. The results were shocking. In spring 2023, Gibbon, who recently turned 69, was told he had advanced stage lung cancer.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. by a long shot, accounting for about 1 in 5 cancer deaths every year, according to the American Cancer Society.After months of aggressive treatment with chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy Gibbon’s cancer shrunk, but his lungs were sustaining irreversible damage. His doctors determined that Gibbon had exhausted his treatment options.“I would have to throw in the towel,” Gibbon said. “I would have been on palliative hospice care from July 2023.”That’s when he remembered a news story he’d seen, one he thought could save his life.Last year, NBC News reported on a groundbreaking treatment for late-stage lung cancer patients: the first-ever double lung transplants, which were successfully performed on two patients.When the story aired, Gibbon’s wife, Nola Roller, pulled her husband into their living room to watch it. He had already been diagnosed with lung cancer, but “it didn’t even register with me that this is something we were going to need,” Roller said.According to conventional treatment, the fact that Gibbon had late-stage lung cancer disqualified him from being a transplant candidate. But in the NBC News story, doctors at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago were doing precisely that.Lung transplants for cancer patients have historically been reserved for people with earlier stages of cancer and involved replacing one lung at a time. The technique is risky. Cancer can spread from the remaining lung, contaminating the new one, and surgical incisions can allow cancer cells to leak into the bloodstream.Northwestern Medicine’s DREAM Program pioneered a novel approach that had been successfully performed on two stage 4 lung cancer patients. By taking both cancerous lungs out of the body at the same time and replacing them with two healthy, transplanted lungs, the surgical team significantly reduces the risk of cancer cells contaminating both the new organs and other parts of the body. The team has successfully completed more than 30 lung transplants for advanced lung cancer since 2021.Gibbons asked his doctors in California to reach out to the Northwestern team to pitch him as their next candidate. His cancer had not spread outside of his lungs, which would have disqualified him from the surgery. But initial tests revealed another complication: Gary’s liver had started failing as a result of his cancer treatments.He was now in need of a triple transplant — two lungs and a liver.That procedure in a cancer patient “hadn’t been done in this country,” said Dr. Ankit Bharat, director of the Northwestern Medicine Canning Thoracic Institute.Lifesaving logistics The team had to quickly make a decision on whether it would try the procedure. Gibbon was already in UCLA's intensive care unit with both his liver and lungs failing. He was malnourished and on oxygen. Figuring out how to safely transport him from Los Angeles to Chicago was just the beginning.Dr. Gary Gibbon recovering from the double lung and liver transplant.Courtesy Dr. Gibbon“Then [we had] to determine his eligibility for something that had never been done, and then get a consensus of the team and determine all the steps that we’re going to have to take to get him through a complex double lung and a liver transplant,” Bharat said.The team had the technology and skills to pull off the procedure — it just wasn’t exactly sure how. Bharat’s colleague, Dr. Satish Nadig, director of the Comprehensive Transplant Center and chief of organ transplantation at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, remembers the phone call he got from Bharat last summer telling him about Gibbon’s case.“The first thing I thought was, ‘How do we get this done?’” Nadig said. “This patient needed it, and we were the only place in the world that could do it.”A month after an initial video call with the doctors at Northwestern, Gibbon was in Chicago. Four days after his arrival, a set of lungs and a liver became available.The procedure was incredibly complex.“On a scale of 1 to 10, it’s off the charts,” said Nadig, noting that lung and liver transplants are two of the most difficult transplants to do on their own, much less combined.A new technology called liver perfusion, sometimes referred to as “liver in a box,” kept the donated liver alive while surgeons carefully removed Gibbon’s cancerous lungs and replaced them with the transplants. The perfusion machine sat in the operating room, pumping body-temperature blood through the new liver to keep it alive and functioning as it would inside the body, until Gibbon’s body was ready for it.Incredibly, a surgery that would normally take a minimum of 14 hours took the team just 10.Six months after the surgery, Gibbon is cancer-free.""I feel like I was never sick,"" said Gibbon. ""I feel like my life has been saved.""Northwestern MedicineRoller remembers the moment she first saw her husband’s chest moving up and down as the new lungs inflated, something she hadn’t seen in months and described as “the most beautiful moment for me.”Bharat said the biggest lesson the more than 20-person care team learned through Gibbon’s transplant is that a good team can alter the definition of what is or is not possible. He believes more transplant centers will soon be performing more complex surgeries like these.“We have already had other centers reach out to us asking if they could participate in this program,” Bharat said. “Often what’s possible is a function of the team and the experience.”He encourages patients to do some homework if they’ve been told they are out of options. Nadig said he’s amazed by the role the media had in connecting Gibbon with the DREAM program.Asked what would have happened if she and her husband had not seen the NBC News report, Roller answered immediately. “He would be dead.”",[]

The suit — filed Wednesday in Butler County, the family’s attorney Rob Peirce said — alleges the center and its operator were negligent, failed to train employees to recognize and report abuse, and failed to remove Pressdee from Cymbol’s care even though she had bullied him and called him a derogatory term.Sunnyview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.Cymbol’s deathCymbol, 43, was a resident at Sunnyview. He was a “brittle diabetic,” meaning he often experienced large swings in his blood glucose levels, he had an anoxic brain injury, blindness and neuropathy and thus required around-the-clock care, the complaint said.Pressdee, who was hired in January 2023, was the manager of the unit where Cymbol lived.In that role, she was responsible for providing direct care to residents, addressing resident care concerns and conducting internal investigations into staff complaints or abuse.The complaint alleged Pressdee “routinely insulted, berated, bullied and abused Mr. Cymbol, just as she had done to other residents.”Staff allegedly knew she “disliked” Cymbol, and she routinely called him derogatory terms in reference to his brain injury within earshot of other Sunnyview staff, the filing said.Sunnyview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Butler County, Pa.Google MapsOn several occasions, she allegedly prevented other nurses from feeding or giving water to Cymbol, and had him eat alone when he was taken to the communal dining room.Pressdee had already been linked to other suspicious resident deaths when she was caring for him, the complaint said.One one occasion, she told other staff members Cymbol was “going to be the next one to die anyway,” the complaint said.Despite these red flags, the facility didn’t remove Pressdee from his care, the complaint said.On April 30, 2023, Cymbol’s nurse recorded his blood sugar level at 167 mg/dL at 6:30 a.m. Just 30 minutes later, at 7 a.m., Pressdee documented his blood sugar had allegedly risen to 380 mg/dL.Pressdee then injected Cymbol with 60 units of insulin, and his blood sugar plummeted. She then tried to reverse the drop by administering multiple doses of glucagon, the filing said.The suit said she initially refused to call 911, but paramedics were eventually called after she was confronted by other staffers.Cymbol was taken to Butler Memorial Hospital for hypoglycemia — a condition in which one’s blood sugar level is lower than the standard range — and was discharged and returned to Sunnyview that same evening.Despite having been hospitalized, Sunnyview nursing staff allegedly failed to monitor his blood sugar and condition.That evening into the morning of May 1, his condition “gradually declined,” the complaint said.Shortly after 4 a.m. on May 1, a nurse at Sunnyview who was not Pressdee found him in a “hypoglycemic crisis and foaming at the mouth.”Cymbol’s sister, Melinda Brown, was called and told to come to the facility. At 4:30 a.m. she received a call from a nurse saying Cymbol had died.His cause of death was initially identified as myocardial infarction.At first, Cymbol’s family believed he died of natural causes, the suit said, but it wasn't until an investigation by the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General that they ultimately learned Pressdee had administered an excessive and lethal dose of insulin to Cymbol, resulting in his death.The day Cymbol died, Pressdee was terminated by Sunnyview for exhibiting abusive behavior toward residents and staff, according to the complaint.After Cymbol’s death, she sent a sympathy card to his family saying, “nick was one of a kind,” according to the suit.Failures at SunnyviewThe suit said the center failed in even hiring Pressdee given her checkered career history, in which she worked at 10 medical facilities from 2018 to December 2022 and was forced to resign or was terminated from each of those jobs due to “abusive tendencies and behavior toward residents and staff.”While at Sunnyview, she allegedly exhibited “troubling and erratic behavior,” but the facility “consistently failed” to train staff to recognize and report the abuse or neglect of residents. As a result, her abuse was allowed to “pervade throughout the facility,” the complaint said.The suit said members of the Sunnyview nursing staff began to notice residents whom Pressdee had access to “were passing away unexpectedly and/or under suspicious circumstances, causing the nursing staff to believe Pressdee had involvement in their deaths.”The suit outlined some of those other suspicious resident deaths.But the center “completely and repeatedly ignored the concerns of staff and residents pertaining to Pressdee’s treatment of residents.”Pressdee’s arrest and chargesWeeks after Cymbol’s death and Pressdee’s subsequent termination, the Pennsylvania Department of Health conducted an investigation of the facility, according to the complaint.Sunnyview Operating LLC and the center terminated or reprimanded staff who provided information to the department regarding resident deaths or Pressdee’s conduct, the complaint said.On May 24, 2023, an arrest warrant was issued and she was taken into custody in connection with two resident deaths from insulin-induced hypoglycemia at Quality Life Services–Chicora, the lawsuit said.She admitted to injecting those residents with the intention of killing them and she was subsequently charged with two counts of criminal homicide, counts later upgraded to murder in the first and third degree, the complaint said.Then, in November, she was charged with 17 additional counts of attempted homicide and 19 counts of neglect of care-dependent persons for deaths at facilities in Butler, Allegheny, Westmoreland and Armstrong counties.In Cymbol’s case, she was charged with murder and criminal neglect.The criminal investigation into Pressdee is ongoing.The November attorney general’s office news release announcing the additional charges does not note charges filed against Sunnyview.Lawyers representing Pressdee in the criminal case, Phil DiLucente and Jim DePasquale, said they are not involved with the civil lawsuits but added that it’s possible the former nurse “pleads guilty to everything she is charged with” and that a status hearing has been set for May.If she pleads guilty, “the only issue becomes whether she was negligently hired and or negligently supervised and what the damages are,” the lawyers said.The new suit, filed by Brown, Cymbol’s sister, as well as the administrator of his estate, seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.“We were hired by the families of Heather Pressdee’s victims to get answers as to how she was permitted to continue working in these facilities, despite her erratic, disturbing, and abusive behavior,” Peirce, an attorney representing Brown, said in a statement Wednesday. “The more our office has investigated, the more questions we have as to why these facilities allowed these tragedies to occur.”",[]

Greg Abbott has called abusive.Abbott, a Republican, had ordered the state Department of Family Protective Services to carry out child abuse investigations into families whose children were receiving puberty-blocking treatments in February 2022.A month later, a district court judge imposed a statewide temporary injunction on such investigations, saying the probes endangered children and their families.The appeals court in Austin upheld the district court judge’s injunction in a pair of rulings on Friday, delivering a victory to LGBTQ groups, medical professionals and civil liberties advocates opposing moves by conservative politicians in dozens of states to criminalize the provision of gender-affirming treatments for trans youth.“This is a much-needed victory for trans youth and those who love and support them,” the American Civil Liberties Union said on X on Friday.Representatives for Abbott and the DFPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The ACLU and Lambda Legal challenged Abbott’s order on behalf of the family of a 16-year-old transgender girl targeted for investigation.The child had taken puberty-delaying medications and hormone therapy. Her mother was a DFPS employee and was put on paid administrative leave after asking what Abbott’s directive would mean for her family.In 2022, the district court judge said the governor’s order could cause “irreparable injury” to families, given the stigma attached to being targets of a child abuse investigation, as well as the loss of livelihood.Texas restricted gender-affirming care for youth in 2023, making it one of more than a dozen states that currently bars young transgender people from receiving certain puberty-blockers and hormone therapies, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

The drugs can be expensive, depending on insurance coverage, but have drawn extensive attention in part because they have been promoted by celebrities and on social media sites.The Saints’ pig is a beloved participant in the team’s games played at CHS Field in downtown St. Paul, about 10 miles from the much larger home of the Minnesota Twins in downtown Minneapolis. The animal carries out balls to the umpire and over the course of the summer becomes noticeably larger — so much larger in fact that another young pig takes over duties midway through the season.Naming the pig mascot after the high-profile drug seemed a natural for the Saints, a Triple-A affiliate of the Twins that has a long history of amusing promotions, such as attaching a fan to a Velcro wall in the outfield and holding races in the infield between people dressed as giant eyeballs.With such past stunts in mind, some Saints fans defended the name as a play on words and nothing more.Aronson said team officials understood why some people are outraged and considered making a name change but decided to stick with Ozempig.“We knew how we originally came up with the name and we’re good with it but we did discuss it and decided we’re going to keep it,” he said.",[]

After a night in the hospital, Fahrney is now back home and trying to process what happened. ""It's very scary. You never think this is going to happen to you,"" he said in a phone call Friday. ""My stepdaughter when she called from Florida, she said, 'Well, luckily, you're the kind of person that just won't take out your phone and start recording. You were the one that went over there and scared this guy off to protect her.'"" Keith Fahrney.Courtesy of Keith FahrneyAuthorities said the rampage began shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday and involved ""multiple scenes"" in Rockford and an area of Winnebago County. Soto, 22, was arrested after police said he stabbed three people to death and fatally beat a 15-year-old girl who was watching movies with her sister and friend. He faces numerous charges of murder, attempted murder and home invasion. The victims killed were identified as Jacob Schupbach, 23; Ramona Schupbach, 63; Jay Larson, 49, a mailman; and Jenna Newcomb, 15. Seven others, including Fahrney, were injured.Fahrney, who is studying to be an engineer, said he was on his way home when he saw a wild scene: two women with blankets and towels running down the street screaming for help. ""I drove maybe another 1,000 feet or whatever and noticed that there was this lady sitting in the middle of her yard with somebody standing over the top of her,"" he said. ""She looked like she was in distress as I was starting to pass her. So, I slammed on my brakes. I got out of the vehicle."" Fahrney, who lives in Rockford, said he approached the woman and asked if she was OK. Soto then moved away from her, he said. When Fahrney realized that the woman was covered in blood, he went to his vehicle to grab his cellphone and came face-to-face with Soto, who had jumped in the driver's seat of Fahrney's car and was trying to flee. ""I opened up my door, grabbed him, threw him out,"" he said. ""We kind of wrestled around for a couple of seconds and then I noticed that he was trying to like tap me in the head. ... And at that time, I noticed that this liquid was running down my chest and I put my hand up to my head and there was blood. I realized that he had stabbed me or did something to me."" During the fight, police arrived and arrested Soto after a brief foot chase, according to authorities. Fahrney said Soto had stabbed him in the neck and slashed the back of his head. He received eight staples for his head injury and three stitches underneath his chin. He said Soto did not say anything during the attacks but ""looked very estranged like something had taken over his body.""Sheriff Gary Caruana said Thursday that the woman ""could have easily been deceased"" if it wasn't for Fahrney. ""The good Samaritan stopped that situation,"" Caruana said at a news conference. ""He did a tremendous job in helping."" A motive for the attacks remains unclear. Winnebago County State’s Attorney J. Hanley said Soto admitted to the attacks and said he had taken marijuana that he believed was ""laced with an unknown narcotic"" before the rampage.Soto appeared in court Thursday afternoon and was denied pretrial release until his next hearing.Fahrney said he does not consider himself a hero and thinks ""human nature"" is what made him jump out and help.   ""I'm just a guy that was trying to help somebody that needed help,"" he said. Fahrney said he hopes other people will do the same for someone who is in danger.""In today’s world, people need to get off their phones. They need to stop recording,"" he said.

The dialogue, which hasn’t been previously reported, shows how the center said it would make “a splash” unless the consumer electronics giant moved in favor of its demands. In some of the last correspondence in the filing, Best Buy noted that it allows its employee resource groups “some discretion to directly support organizations of their choosing” but added that “any such contributions would be screened to ensure they do not advocate or support the causes or agendas you have identified as concerning.” One of the causes the NCPPR cited was transgender care for minors, which the group falsely described as an attempt to “mutilate the reproductive organs of children.”When asked for a request for comment regarding the filing, Carly Charlson, a spokesperson for Best Buy, stated in an email: “At Best Buy, we strongly believe in an inclusive work environment with a culture of belonging where everyone feels valued and has the opportunity to thrive. This commitment is evident through our longstanding and continuing support of organizations like HRC, which has recognized us as one of the best places to work for the LGBTQIA+ community for the past 18 years.”She then sent a followup email adding, “Nothing has changed in the ways we give to LGBTQIA+ organizations.”In HRC, Charlson was referring to the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ-rights group.“The news of this SEC filing is very concerning, and we are working in partnership with Best Buy to understand more,"" Eric Bloem, HRC’s vice president of programs and corporate advocacy, said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""Any company that uses their Corporate Equality Index distinction as cover while working with fringe groups and bad actors does not reflect true LGBTQ+ allyship in the corporate space.""The communication in the SEC filing began on Dec. 11, when the NCPPR sent Best Buy a shareholder proposal asking the retailer to produce by June — and distribute at Best Buy’s annual shareholder meeting that month — a report for investors analyzing how its partnerships with LGBTQ nonprofits are benefitting the company’s business.“Best Buy has partnerships with and contributes to organizations and activists that promote the practice of gender transition surgeries on minors and evangelize gender theory to minors. Why are Best Buy shareholders funding the proliferation of an ideology seeking to mutilate the reproductive organs of children before they finish puberty?” the proposal, signed by Ethan Peck, an associate at the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Institute, states. “This contentious and vast disagreement between radical gender theory activists and the general public has nothing to do with Best Buy selling electronics.”In an email dated Jan. 17, Peck told Best Buy’s attorneys that his organization “will withdraw its proposal if Best Buy were to end its partnerships with and contributions to” eight different LGBTQ nonprofits and initiatives, which he refers to as “predatory butchers” in his email. These groups include The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization; SAGE, which advocates on behalf of LGBTQ elders; and GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy group.Peck did, however, leave the Human Rights Campaign off this list, stating in his email that “we understand that it’s unrealistic for Best Buy to leave HRC in the near future because of their political clout.”“We hope you take this off-ramp for the sake of shareholders,” Peck wrote in the Jan. 17 email. “Were Best Buy to agree to such a compromise with us, we will not make a splash about it.”In a Feb. 5 email, Marina Rizzo, a Best Buy attorney, told Peck that the company had reviewed his organization’s concerns and informed him that the company hadn’t donated in several years to two of the LGBTQ causes mentioned in the Jan. 17 email — the Trevor Project and Our Gay History in 50 States — and has never donated to the other six. She then says the company would screen certain donations the NCPPR may find concerning.“As discussed during our call, we do allow our individual employee organizations, including our Military ERG, Conservative employee interest group, and our PRIDE group, among many other groups, some discretion to directly support organizations of their choosing,” Rizzo wrote. “That said, any such contributions would be screened to ensure they do not advocate or support the causes or agendas you have identified as concerning. We hope this addresses the concerns.” (In a letter included in the SEC filing, Best Buy notes that its employee resource groups “are provided with their own funding and have the capability to identify sponsorships to receive that funding, subject to internal guidelines and Company oversight.”)Later that day, Peck thanked Rizzo in an email “for looking into this” and added, “we’re definitely delighted to hear all that.” He then raised several follow-up questions, including why a page on the Best Buy website still indicates the company supports the Trevor Project and a book titled “Our Gay History in 50 States.” “We’re going to need some kind of proof that that funding has ended,” Peck wrote. The link to the Best Buy LGBTQ page, which Peck included in his email, was no longer functioning as of Friday, though a version of it can still be viewed through the Internet Archive. A page on Best Buy’s website about its support of “Our Gay History in 50 States” was also no longer available as of Friday but still viewable through the Internet Archive. In an email on Feb. 9, Rizzo informed Peck that Best Buy would submit a letter to the SEC that afternoon asking that the regulator not take any action against the company for omitting NCPPR’s proposal from shareholder materials. She also told him that the letter is a “standard part of the proposal process, and we intend to continue our dialogue.” She ended the email by writing, “We remain ready to reach an understanding in conjunction with the withdrawal agreement you initially outlined.”No additional email correspondence is included in the SEC filing after Feb. 9, and it’s unclear whether an agreement between Best Buy and NCPPR was ever reached. On March 22, NCPPR withdrew its Dec. 11 shareholder proposal. Then, on Tuesday of this week, Best Buy pulled its Feb. 9 “no action” request from the SEC, and the agency sent a letter on Wednesday confirming the matter was moot. This, in turn, ensures NCPPR’s shareholder proposal regarding LGBTQ donations will not be presented at Best Buy’s annual shareholder meeting in June. In response to NBC News’ request for comment, Peck declined to share any specifics regarding his communication with Best Buy, stating, “We don’t discuss confidential discussions.” He did, however, confirm that his organization has sent similar proposals to other public companies, though he did not name them.When asked why he chose the eight LGBTQ causes mentioned in the Best Buy SEC filing, he wrote, “We used those groups as examples of groups that have adopted radical and divisive positions on LGBTQ issues, but we recognize that many more such groups exist.”The exchange between Best Buy and the NCPPR comes as many large companies face renewed pressure from conservatives to curb their public support for the LGBTQ community.Major consumer brands, including Bud Light and Target, have faced heated criticism from conservative activists, prompting a rollback of LGBTQ-focused marketing campaigns and products as well as calls for boycotts. In Bud Light’s case, sales declined and shares of its parent company, Anheuser-Busch Inbev, tumbled in the months following the beer brand’s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney on April 1 of last year, though the stock has since rebounded.In an email on Friday, GLAAD, one of the LGBTQ nonprofits mentioned in the SEC filing, expressed its displeasure with Best Buy.“Executives at Best Buy ought to be ashamed of how they turned their backs on their LGBTQ and ally employees and consumers,” GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said. “They know what they did was wrong, or they would not have tried to hide this cowardly, toxic corporate takeover inside an ordinary SEC filing.” For more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

Prosecutors alleged that she inadvertently brought live bullets onto the set — a major breach of film safety protocols — and failed to properly check the rounds before loading one of them into Baldwin’s gun.Baldwin is scheduled to face his own involuntary manslaughter trial in July for pointing the gun at the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and, allegedly, pulling the trigger.Gutierrez Reed was taken into custody following the jury’s verdict.

In that case, the court overturned a guilty verdict on the grounds that the jury instructions were confusing.The defense argued that the instructions in the Gutierrez Reed case were similarly confusing, and that the Taylor case made it nearly certain that her conviction would be overturned. Prosecutors pushed back, however, arguing that the two cases were dissimilar.In the Taylor case, the jurors were asked to convict based on four separate acts joined by an “and/or” clause.

They will be used to clear the channel of the twisted metal and concrete remnants of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, as well as the cargo ship that hit it this week.In total, four heavy lift cranes will be at the site by Monday, Gov. Wes Moore told reporters Friday. He said in the following weeks, seven floating cranes, 10 tugs, nine barges, eight salvage vessels and five Coast Guard boats will be at the wreckage site to clear the channel as soon as possible.Moore noted that one of the biggest challenges is that the Key Bridge over the wrecked Dali cargo ship weighs somewhere between 3 to 4,000 tons, meaning the salvage team must cut up the truss into sections ""in a safe and responsible way"" before those pieces can be lifted out of the water.Divers had already recovered the bodies of two men from a pickup truck in the Patapsco River, but the nature and placement of the debris has complicated efforts to find the four workers still missing and presumed dead.“The divers can put their hands on that faceplate, and they can’t even see their hands,” said Donald Gibbons, an instructor with Eastern Atlantic States Carpenters Technical Centers. “So we say zero visibility. It’s very similar to locking yourself in a dark closet on a dark night and really not being able to see anything.”Divers must cut up debris to remove it, Gibbons said, likening it to playing pick-up sticks, since items at the bottom can’t move without disturbing the whole pile.“So we use underwater burning and underwater cutting solutions to help make those pieces smaller so that when we do cut them away, we’re not affecting the entire pile,” said Gibbons, who is not involved in the Baltimore effort.Baltimoreans made morning stops at vantage points to watch for the cranes. Ronald Hawkins, who is 71 and could see the bridge from his home, recalled watching its construction in 1972. It opened in 1977.Now, with sadness, he stopped by an overlook, seeking closure.“I’m going to come up here every day, because I want to see the bridge coming up out of the water,” Hawkins said. “It’s a hurtin’ thing.”“The best minds in the world” are working on the removal plans, Moore said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Baltimore district told the governor that it and the Navy were quickly mobilizing resources from around the country.“This is not just about Maryland,” said Moore, a Democrat. “This is about the nation’s economy. The port handles more cars and more farm equipment than any other port in America.”He thanked President Joe Biden’s administration for approving $60 million in immediate aid. Biden has said the federal government will pay the full cost of rebuilding the bridge.Ship traffic at the Port of Baltimore remains suspended, but the Maryland Port Administration said in a statement Friday that trucks were still being processed at marine terminals.“There is a lot of speculation as to when the channel will be reopened,” the agency said. “The fact of the matter is we do not know.”Federal and state officials have said the collision and collapse early Tuesday appeared to be an accident that came after the ship lost power. Investigators are still trying to determine why.The victims, who were part of a construction crew fixing potholes on the bridge, were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, officials said. At least eight people initially went into the water when the ship struck the bridge column, and two of them were rescued, officials said.Moore said Friday, “I’ll be proposing the creation of a permanent state scholarship for the children of surviving spouses of transportation workers who lost their lives on this job.”The crash caused the bridge to break and fall into the water within seconds. Authorities had just enough time to stop vehicle traffic but were unable to alert the construction crew.During the Baltimore Orioles’ opening day game Thursday, Sgt. Paul Pastorek, Cpl. Jeremy Herbert and Officer Garry Kirts, of the Maryland Transportation Authority, were honored for their actions in halting bridge traffic and preventing further loss of life.The three said in a statement that they were “proud to carry out our duties as officers of this state to save the lives that we could.”The cargo ship Dali, which is managed by Synergy Marine Group, had been headed from Baltimore to Sri Lanka. It is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and was chartered by Danish shipping giant Maersk.The loss of a road that carried 30,000 vehicles a day and the port disruption will affect not only thousands of dockworkers and commuters, but also U.S. consumers, who are likely to feel the impact of shipping delays.Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoremen’s Association Local 333, said the union was scrambling to help its roughly 2,400 members whose jobs are at risk of drying up.“If there’s no ships, there’s no work,” he said. “We’re doing everything we can.”The huge vessel was carrying nearly 4,700 shipping containers, 56 of them with hazardous materials inside. Fourteen were destroyed, officials said. Industrial hygienists who evaluated the contents identified them as perfumes and soaps, the Key Bridge Joint Information Center said, and there was “no immediate threat to the environment.”Containers are hanging dangerously off the side of the ship, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Shannon Gilreath said. “We’re trying to keep our first responders … as safe as possible.”",[]

Bill Lee, in an unprecedented move, signed into law legislation that dismantled the storied historically Black college’s board of trustees.Calls for a new board began in 2023, after multiple audit reports highlighted concerns around the mishandling of finances, housing and scholarships. A bill was then crafted that would replace three board members, before being amended to remove all of them. A new forensic audit spanning from July 2019 through June 2023 was released Wednesday. It offered dozens of recommendations and pointed to “deficient processes” but did not uncover “fraud or malfeasance.” The following day, the Republican-controlled and majority-white Tennessee House voted in favor of the bill dismantling the board, 66-25. Lee quickly signed it into law.Lee said he was “pleased” with the appointments for a new board — all of whom are Black and distinguished members of the Nashville business and political community.TSU president Glenda Glover is stepping down in June, and a search is underway for her replacement. Not everyone is happy with the goings-on.Democratic Rep. Harold Love, who is a TSU alum, said vacating the whole board leaves the school in flux at a time when the president is a lame duck. “We are deeply concerned about the effect it will have upon the administration, the students and the direction the school is trying to go into to rectify some of the concerns raised in the audits,” Love said. Harold Love, Jr., publicly spoke against the bill in Nashville on Thursday. George Walker IV / APHe added, “We had an amendment in Government Operations (Committee) that vacated three board members, and that was the amendment we thought was going to be on the bill. In the conversations, things did not go the way I guess some of the members wanted to have happen, so as a result they chose that route.”Many students at Tennessee State are in an uproar, and they believe the changes are too dramatic, making the school vulnerable to more issues, Nashville’s WTVF reported. Additionally, students told the outlet that their opinions were not considered before the law was passed.Tennessee State University supporters attended the vote on Thursday.George Walker IV / APMany students protested at the state Capitol in Nashville on Thursday, holding a banner that read: “TSU Take Over.”After the vote, House Majority Leader William Lamberth tried to downplay the new law.“All we’re talking about is the board,” he said. “It’s vacating some personalities and bringing others in. The goal is to make TSU successful.”While vacating the board, the Tennessee Assembly members did not seem to take into account that TSU has been underfunded for years, to the tune of $2.1 billion, according to The Washington Post, which analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics between 1987 and 2020. The audit showed that Tennessee State was owed $544 million in land-grant funding over five decades; $250 million were allocated in April 2022.Lee and Glover did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.“This is unprecedented, unfortunate, and uncharted waters for any public university in the state,” a statement from Tennessee State University read, according to The Tennessean. “We believe this legislation will disrupt our students’ educational pursuits, harm the image of the University, and remove a Board that had achieved success in its enhanced governance of TSU.” The statement also defended the university’s use of taxpayer dollars.Last September, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack sent a letter to Lee, highlighting data from the National Center for Education Statistics that showed white land-grant universities were funded significantly more than historically Black land-grant institutions.The result was a “severe financial gap” in funding between the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, a land-grant institution established in 1862, and Tennessee State, which “in the last 30 years alone” should have had access to an additional $2.1 billion.The Post also reported that Black land-grant universities nationwide suffered a $12.6 billion disparity of funds, with the worst cases at TSU and North Carolina A&T in Greensboro.“It’s all disheartening,” said Ramona Willis, a retired school teacher who graduated from Tennessee State in the 1970s. “They hold back billions of dollars from the school, but yet they want to remove the board? Could some issues be because we just didn’t have enough money, money that is just sitting out there that should be ours? It’s hard to accept that they can know this and yet ignore it and put our school in disarray.”",[]

The department did not provide additional details about the violations, which were documented during an investigation that was completed this month.The department said that it determined the violations “endanger the health, safety, and welfare of clients in your facility” and that it intends to revoke Trails Carolina’s license. The camp was given 10 days to provide a written statement saying why it believes it is in compliance with the rules, along with supporting documents or a plan of correction. The department also fined Trails Carolina $18,000 for the violations and extended its suspension of admissions indefinitely.In a statement on Friday, Trails Carolina said it was “surprised and disappointed to learn of the state’s intent to revoke the program’s license, given the progress we’ve made and continue to make.”“We will continue cooperating with the state to satisfy their concerns so we can continue providing compassionate quality care to kids and families for whom every other treatment option has failed,” the camp said in an email to NBC News.Trails Carolina is a private, for-profit wilderness program for children who struggle with behavioral problems or depression and are typically sent to the camp by their parents. The children at Trails Carolina have diagnoses such as autism, ADHD, bipolar and post-traumatic stress disorders.A boy identified by the Transylvania County Sheriff’s Office only by his initials, CJH, was found dead at Trails Carolina on Feb. 3 with his pants and underwear removed, prompting an ongoing criminal investigation. The cause of death has not yet been determined, but the sheriff’s office said in a statement shortly after the death that, according to a forensic pathologist, it “appeared to not be natural.” Trails Carolina has said that preliminary information indicates the boy’s death was accidental. The state Department of Health and Human Services declined to say whether the violations prompting the license revocation are connected to the boy’s death. The license inspection reports detailing the actions resulting in the violations were not immediately released.The 18 children who had been at the camp when the 12-year-old died were removed later in February. Over a dozen people who were placed at Trails Carolina between 2013 and 2022 told NBC News that the camp’s rules and protocols had caused them serious concern and, in some cases, ongoing trauma. The camp defended its approach but declined to comment on specific children’s experiences.",[]

Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin wrote in a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and ICE acting Deputy Director Patrick Lechleitner.“ICE has failed to follow its own guidelines that limit both the punitive use of solitary confinement and the imposition of additional forms of punishment in solitary confinement,” added the lawmakers, who were joined by eight other Democratic senators and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.ICE statistics show the agency detains more than 38,000 people each day, an increase of about 15,000 since President Joe Biden took office in 2021.The senators cited a study released last month that found 1,106 uses of “segregation” — informally known as solitary confinement — in the third quarter of 2023, up 61% from a year prior. Researchers at Harvard University and the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights based the analysis on ICE’s own data, and also established the agency placed people in solitary confinement over 14,000 times in the past five years with an average duration of 27 days — “well exceeding the 15-day threshold that United Nations human rights experts have found constitutes torture.”Philip Torrey, an assistant clinical professor at Harvard Law School and researcher on the study, said that given the findings, they would like to see ICE “end the use of segregation and at the very least begin a phase out process to discontinue its use.”The Democratic lawmakers agreed, writing in their letter that “at a minimum, DHS and ICE must issue binding rules limiting its use of solitary confinement and follow them.”The senators said they are especially concerned about detainees in the most vulnerable populations, including LGBTQ people and those with mental health and chronic medical conditions.Medical and mental health remain the largest reasons why immigration detainees are placed in segregation, according to ICE data on its website, followed by disciplinary and protective custody issues.Markey said he felt obligated to urge DHS and ICE to “phase out” solitary confinement after reports of its use on detainees for even minor infractions or as retaliation for conducting a hunger strike.“Solitary confinement is unfair and cruel, and it’s time for our government to stop using it,” Markey told NBC News.The senators asked Mayorkas and Lechleitner for answers to several questions, including what steps have been taken to limit solitary confinement, what is the breakdown of time spent in it and by vulnerable population, and what is the agency doing to respond to recommendations from government accountability and oversight offices to ensure clear and consistent policies for segregation.DHS and ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the senators’ letter or the study they cited.In 2013, ICE issued a directive that the use of segregated housing must be carefully weighed.“Placement in segregation should occur only when necessary and in compliance with applicable detention standards,” the agency said at the time. “In particular, placement in administrative segregation due to a special vulnerability should be used only as a last resort and when no other viable housing options exist.”The agency also agreed to protect transgender people in a 2015 memorandum.Immigration advocacy groups remain dismayed over the use of solitary confinement and say the issue is taking greater importance ahead of an upcoming election that is on course to see a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump.In 2019, an NBC News investigation in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other news organizations found a widespread use of solitary confinement for immigrant detainees in ICE custody under both the Obama and Trump administrations.Concerns continue in detention centers under the Biden administration, with detainees in Louisiana last year telling NBC News about the threat and use of solitary confinement as punishment. The president has been criticized during his tenure about the increased use of so-called restrictive housing in federal prisons as well, despite a campaign pledge to end solitary confinement except for “very limited” reasons. Bills were introduced last year in the U.S. Senate and the House by Democrats to largely ban the practice on federal inmates and detainees.Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which offers legal representation for detainees, said he believes what has been happening in federal facilities must change because it is “arbitrary.”“There’s already weak standards in terms of human rights and basic humanity, and there’s not a lot of oversight and accountability from staff just throwing people into solitary and them not having the opportunity to get out,” Franzblau said. “This is how it plays out on the ground when members of Congress say the government is violating its own policies.”",[]

Already, 143 cases have been reported this year, meaning infections appear to be on track to surpass 2023, the CDC said. Most of the cases last year did not involve meningitis, though at least 17 died. The cases were disproportionately more common in adults ages 30 to 60, in Black people and in people who have HIV, the CDC said.Officials told NBC News that the cases last year were detected in 20 states. Departments of health in Texas and Virginia have previously alerted the public about upticks in meningococcal disease. The bacteria can cause a dangerous brain and spinal cord inflammation called meningitis, with symptoms that may include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting. The bacteria also can cause a bloodstream infection with symptoms like chills, fatigue, cold hands and feet, rapid breathing, diarrhea, or, in later stages, a dark purple rash that doesn't fade or turn white when pressed. It can pop up anywhere on the body. The infection can be treated with antibiotics, but quick treatment is essential. Symptoms of a bloodstream infection can “rapidly worsen,” a CDC official said. An estimated 10% to 15% of infected people die, and survivors sometimes suffer deafness or amputations.There also are vaccines against meningococcal disease.Officials recommend that all children should get a meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which protects against the rising strain, at around the time they enter a middle school. Since vaccine protection fades, the CDC also recommends a booster dose at age 16. Shots also are recommended for people at higher risk, like those in a place where an outbreak is occurring or those with HIV infection or certain other health conditions.",[]

Certain life events remain clear in our minds no matter how long ago they occurred, while episodes from the prior day may already be fuzzy and difficult to recall.A study, published Thursday in Science, reveals why this happens. Scientists have found that the brains of humans and other mammals have a system for choosing which life experiences are important enough to be cemented into long-term memory — and which will be allowed to fade away.Experiments in mice revealed that during waking hours, cells in the brain’s hippocampus spark in a specific pattern called ""sharp-wave ripples,"" which tag important experiences for movement into long-term memory storage during sleep. Although the research was performed in mice, certain brain processes have remained almost the same as mammals have evolved, so the findings can tell us a lot about ourselves, said the study’s senior author, Dr. György Buzsáki, Biggs Professor of Neuroscience at NYU Langone Health.As part of the research, Buzsáki and his colleagues put mice through a maze that had a sugary reward at the end for those that successfully reached it. Meanwhile, the researchers were monitoring the activity of nerve cells through electrodes implanted in the rodent brains that fed data into computer programs.  They observed that as the mice paused to eat their treats, their brains sparked sharp-wave ripples that were repeated as many as 20 times. The daytime pattern of sharp-wave ripples was replayed during the night, a process that moved the experience into long-term memory.It's during sleep when experiences from waking hours deemed to be important are converted into enduring memories. Events that were followed by very few or no sharp-wave ripples failed to form lasting memories, the researchers noted.This tagging process during waking hours is totally unconscious, Buzsáki said. “The brain decides on its own, rather than us deciding voluntarily,” he added. Relaxation needed for long-term memoryStill, the research suggests there are things we can do to increase the likelihood of a memory being stored permanently. If, like the mice, we pause after an experience, it may help cement the events into long-term memory, Buzsáki said. We need that period of relaxation, when we’re not paying close attention to anything, to allow sharp-wave ripples to spark. That wakeful process is an essential part of creating a permanent memory.Practically speaking, this means if you like to binge TV series, you’re not likely to remember much of any episode except the last one you watched, Buzsáki said.“If you watch a movie and would like to remember it, it’s better to go for a walk afterwards,” Buzsáki said. “No double features.”An intriguing finding of the new research is the discovery that there could be bursts of activity — the sharp-wave ripples — when the mouse is standing still and its brain is essentially idling, said Daniela Schiller, a professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.What’s amazing, Schiller said, is the pattern recorded close to the event was the same as what was seen during sleep. And both patterns mimicked the mouse’s real-life experience.The study showed that events followed by a pause and electrical bursts in the brain are the ones that we will find in long-term memory, said Daphna Shohamy, director of Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute. If you observe animals, you can see them pausing during the day after a novel or rewarding experience, she said.“We did a study a few years ago in which we had humans navigate a maze with random objects along the way, looking for a treasure,” Shohamy said. “If they got the treasure, they were more likely to remember the random object they passed along the way.”",[]

The House passed the measure 120-45 and the Senate approved it 48-7.The bill, which Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte of Dallas called “transformative,” now goes to Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature or veto.A number of other states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Utah passed laws last year requiring parental consent for children to use social media. In Arkansas, a federal judge in August blocked enforcement of a law requiring parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts.Some in Congress also are proposing parental consent for minors.State Rep. Scott Hilton, a Peachtree Corners Republican, argued the state should do more to limit social media use by children, saying it’s causing harm.“Every rose has a thorn, and that’s social media in this generation,” Hilton said. “It’s great for connectivity and activism, but it has reared its ugly head on mental health.”But opponents warned the bill would cause problems. For example, Rep. David Wilkerson, a Powder Springs Democrat, said that the ban on use of social media in schools could ban teachers from showing educationally valuable YouTube videos.“If we do pass this, we’ll be back fixing this next year, because there are too many issues with this bill,” Wilkerson said.The bill says social media services would have to use “commercially reasonable efforts” to verify someone’s age by July 1, 2025.Services would have to treat anyone who can’t be verified as a minor. Parents of children younger than 16 would have to consent to their children joining a service. Social medial companies would be limited in how they could customize ads for children younger than 16 and how much information they could collect on those children.To comply with federal regulation, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms, but children have been shown to easily evade the bans.Up to 95% of teens aged 13 to 17 report using a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use them “almost constantly,” the Pew Research Center found.The Georgia bill also aims to shut down porn sites by requiring submission of a digitized identification card or some other government-issued identification. Companies could be held liable if minors were found to access the sites, and could face fines of up to $10,000.“It will protect our children,” said Rep. Rick Jasperse, a Jasper Republican who argues age verification will lead porn sites to cut off access to Georgians. In March, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Texas law, leading Pornhub to cut off access to Texans.The Free Speech Coalition, which represents adult film makers, says the bill would be ineffective because users could mask their location and because people would be forced to transmit sensitive information. They also argue it’s unconstitutional because there are less restrictive ways to keep children out and discriminate against certain types of speech. The coalition has sued multiple states over the laws.The ban on school social media excludes email, news, gaming, online shopping, photograph editing and academic sites. The measure also requires a model program on the effects of social media and for students in grades 6-12, and requires existing anti-bullying programs to be updated.The move comes after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in May that social media hasn’t been proven to be safe for young people.Murthy called on tech companies, parents and caregivers to take “immediate action to protect kids now” and asked tech companies to share data and increase transparency and for policymakers to regulate social media for safety the way they do car seats and baby formula.Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instragram, announced in 2022 it was taking steps to verify ages. Meta says it provides “age-appropriate experiences” for teens 13-17 on Instagram, including preventing unwanted contact from unknown adults.Dozens of U.S. states, including California and New York, also are suing Meta Platforms Inc., claiming the company harms young people and contributes to a youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.Florida recently passed a law banning social media accounts for children under 14 regardless of parental consent and require parental permission for 14- and 15-year-olds.",[]

Officers located the bodies of a man and woman identified as Jacob Schupbach, 23, and Ramona Schupbach, 63. Both appeared to have been stabbed, Hanley said. Witnesses said they saw Jacob Schupbach “being chased across the street"" by Soto, according to Hanley.

Christian Soto is accused of going on a rampage Wednesday afternoon, ultimately killing four people and injuring seven others, including Weber and her kids. ""I mean, this is, like, my knight in shining armor, and he’s my son.

Brandy the pit bull.Courtesy Darlene WeberAs she crawled through the house screaming for Vollman to help her, she said, Brandy jumped on and bit the man, giving her enough time to escape. “It all happened like such a blink of an eye,” Weber said. “Remembering back, it was almost like he literally tried to kill me.”She said Vollman then approached the man as she scrambled to find her phone and call 911. Vollman said he went to find his mom, who was screaming for help, ""and I just turn my head, and he’s standing, like, right there.

She said she ran upstairs, where she found her brother ""boxing"" with the man. At first she thought it might have been one of her brother’s friends; then, she said, the man turned toward her, charged at her and ""clocked me one"" before she fell into the fetal position.She said he was about to hit her again when her brother began ""waling on him"" with a syrup bottle.Gilfillan said the attacker then ""dipped"" out the back door, at which point police arrived.

Kevin Franke, who filed for divorce from Ruby Franke in November, said he became Hildebrandt's “resident exorcist” during the time they allowed the former life coach to stay in their house. The two were arrested in August after police found one of Franke’s sons emaciated with open wounds and bound with duct tape. He had escaped Hildebrandt’s home to a neighbor’s house. One of Franke’s daughters was found in a similar malnourished condition in Hildebrandt’s home. Both women were sentenced in February to four one- to 15-year terms in prison, served consecutively. Under Utah law, the maximum aggregate sentence for consecutive terms is 30 years.In the interview, Kevin Franke — who has not been charged with any crimes — said he witnessed Hildebrandt at times “go into possession mode” and “talk in different voices.”“It was really creepy,” he said, “but the voices would say: ‘She’s ours. We’re not letting go. She is Satan’s bride.’”Attorneys for Kevin Franke, Ruby Franke and Hildebrandt did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The interview is the latest window into the monthslong child abuse case that became a public spectacle. Last week, the Washington County Attorney’s Office also released Ruby Franke’s heavily redacted handwritten journal entries, which detailed months of abuse. Ruby Franke, right, and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, in a video posted to their @moms_of_truth Instagram account.@moms_of_truth via InstagramThe Franke family rose to prominence on YouTube, where they amassed 2.3 million subscribers to their now-defunct channel, “8 Passengers.” Ruby Franke’s strict parenting style on the channel had drawn concern from viewers and neighbors in the years before her arrest.Hildebrandt also faced scrutiny over her life-coaching service, ConneXions, which some former clients have described to NBC News as a program that isolated them from loved ones and destroyed marriages.Kevin Franke told authorities why he and Ruby Franke decided to take Hildebrandt in, sharing his timeline of events in the years the two women became close.He said he got involved with ConneXions in 2020 after his wife and one of her close friends persuaded him to join a men’s group that met with Hildebrandt every week. For a while, he said, the meetings seemed to help strengthen their marriage.But things began to change in March 2021, he said, when Hildebrandt allegedly told her inner circle that she “believed she was being tormented and haunted by shadow figures every night.” By mid-April that year, he said, Hildebrandt had reached out to Ruby Franke for help.“Ruby was convinced that we could intervene and help Jodi,” he told investigators. “I didn’t want anything to do with it.”Kevin Franke said he visited Hildebrandt’s home for the first time in May 2021, when she opened up to the couple about her struggles. That was when he noticed “crashes in the basement while we were talking upstairs and plates in the kitchen just flying off by themselves, like full speed smashing on the wall and falling to the floor by themselves.”Eventually, he said, he reluctantly agreed to take Hildebrandt into his and Ruby Franke’s home. He said he saw Hildebrandt go into trances.“The moment she showed up at my house, just the weirdest crap started happening: lights turning on and off, sounds of people walking in walls — like footprints going up walls and across the ceiling — and stuff floating around,” he said. “It was weird and I hated it. And I became the resident exorcist.”He said Ruby Franke had begun going into her own trances by September 2021, during which she allegedly believed she was in heaven speaking with God and Jesus. He claimed she and Hildebrandt would lock themselves in a room for hours, after which, he said, Ruby Franke would tell him about her visions and the work God had called upon them to do.Read NBC News' coverage of Ruby Franke:Ruby Franke sentenced in child abuse case ‘Big day for evil’: Former YouTuber Ruby Franke detailed how she abused her children in handwritten journal entries Ruby Franke’s business partner gave life coaching that ruined lives, some former clients say Kevin Franke described growing more suspicious of Hildebrandt and her intentions as Ruby Franke appeared to grow closer to her. He claimed that prompted Ruby Franke to ask for a separation in July 2022. After he moved out, he told investigators, every week turned into “psychological hell.”“The only way I would ever get back into my house was I had to get Jodi’s approval, because if I didn’t get Jodi’s approval. I would never get Ruby’s approval,” he said. “As I’m looking back, I’m realizing there wasn’t a solution, and it was, you either had Jodi’s approval or you didn’t,” he said, adding, “She became like the arbiter of truth, the arbiter of forgiveness, God’s own mouthpiece.”In October last year, just before Kevin Franke filed for divorce, his attorney Randy Kester told TODAY.com that the Frankes had been separated “at Ruby’s directive.”“Kevin did not want to be separated,” Kester said. “He wanted to work through concerns as a family. There was never any formal, written decree of separate maintenance or separation agreement. The separation was under terms prescribed by Ruby and Jodi Hildebrandt.”Lawyers for Ruby Franke said at the time of the divorce filing that she was “devastated” by the news but that she understood Kevin Franke’s reasoning and respected his decision.During the trial, lawyers for Ruby Franke said Hildebrandt “systematically isolated” her from her family over a long period, which caused her to adopt a “distorted sense of morality” under Hildebrandt’s influence.“For the past four years, I’ve chosen to follow counsel and guidance that has led me into a dark delusion,” Ruby Franke said at her sentencing hearing. “My distorted version of reality went largely unchecked as I would isolate from anyone who challenged me.”Hildebrandt also gave a brief statement to the court during the sentencing.“I desire for [the children] to heal physically and emotionally,” she said. “One of the reasons I did not go to trial is because I did not want them to emotionally relive the experience, which would have been detrimental to them. My hope and prayer is that they will heal and move forward to have beautiful lives.”",[]

Combs has denied all of the allegations, calling them sickening.A source familiar with the matter told NBC News that at least four people have been interviewed about allegations of sex trafficking, sexual assault and the solicitation and distribution of illegal narcotics and firearms.Aaron Dyer, an attorney for Combs, described the raids this week as a “gross overuse of military-level force.” Neither Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested, Dyer noted in his statement.Authorities walk near a property belonging to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs in Los Angeles on March 25.Eric Thayer / APHere are the lawsuits that were filed against Combs prior to the raid. Combs has denied all of the allegations individually through statements by his representatives.November 2023: Cassie and two others file suitThe singer Cassie, Combs’ former romantic partner, shocked many in November when she filed a civil suit against Combs alleging that the music mogul sexually and physically abused her during the course of their relationship. She filed her case on Nov. 16 under New York state’s Adult Survivors Act, which gave adult victims of sexual violence a one-year window to file civil claims regardless of the statute of limitations.In the suit, Cassie alleged that Combs raped her, beat her in fits of “uncontrollable rage” and exerted a “tight hold over her life.” She alleged that he would force her to engage in sex acts he called “Freak Offs” with other men, often sex workers whom he’d pay to travel with them, while he watched.The abuse ranged from 2007 until Cassie left him in late 2018, the suit said.Combs vehemently denied the allegations from Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura. They settled the suit a day after it was filed.Joie Dickerson-Neal said Cassie’s lawsuit inspired her to come forward and file a suit against Combs on Nov. 23, a day before the Adult Survivors Act was set to expire.Dickerson-Neal said that Combs drugged her, sexually assaulted her and recorded the assault without her knowledge while she was a student in 1991. She agreed to have dinner with Combs on Jan. 3, 1991, in Harlem while on winter break from Syracuse University, according to her suit.It was there that Combs “intentionally drugged” her and then took her to a place where he was staying, the suit said. Dickerson-Neal said she “lacked the physical ability or mental capacity to fend Combs off” as he sexually assaulted her.She later learned from a male friend that Combs had filmed the assault and showed it to other people, the suit said. Combs denied her allegations.On the last day of eligibility under the Adult Survivors Act, Liza Gardner filed a lawsuit accusing Combs of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 years old.Gardner alleged that in either 1990 or 1991 she and a friend met Combs and R&B singer Aaron Hall at an event held by MCA Records in Manhattan. After the party, she was invited back to Hall’s apartment with Combs, the suit said, and the two offered her drinks throughout the night.Combs then coerced her into having sex, the suit said, leaving Gardner “shocked and traumatized.” Hall barged into the room after Combs was done, pinned her down, and sexually assaulted her, according to the suit.Hall did not return NBC News’ request for comment on the lawsuit. Combs denied Gardner’s allegations in a statement through his representative.December 2023: Jane Doe says she was gang-raped at 17Then in December, a Jane Doe filed a lawsuit alleging that she was gang-raped and sex-trafficked by Combs and Harve Pierre, a former longtime president of Combs’ record label. The unidentified woman said the assault happened in 2003, when she was 17 and Combs was 34.Sean ""Diddy"" Combs in 2018 in New York.Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images fileAccording to the suit, she met Combs and Pierre at a lounge in Detroit and Combs convinced her to travel with them on a private jet to New York City. Before they left the lounge, the suit said, Pierre smoked crack cocaine and forced Doe to perform oral sex on him.Doe was taken to a studio in New York City, where Combs, Pierre and a third defendant plied her with “copious amounts of drugs and alcohol,” the suit said. The three men took turns raping her in a bathroom at the studio after she was too inebriated to consent, according to the suit.The men allegedly left her on the bathroom floor once they were done and she was flown back to Michigan, the suit said. Combs denied the assault allegations and Pierre called the suit “a tale of fiction.”February 2024: Rodney Jones accuses Combs of ‘RICO enterprise’In February, a man named Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones alleged in a federal suit that Combs and his associates engaged in “serious illegal activity.”Jones worked as a producer on Combs’ latest album, but also lived and traveled with him from September 2022 to November 2023, according to his lawsuit. He alleged that during that time he was sexually harassed by Combs, pressured to engage in sexual acts, forced to procure sex workers for Combs and witnessed Combs giving drinks laced with drugs to people at parties.The suit said that Combs required Jones to “record him constantly,” which resulted in Jones obtaining hours of footage in which Combs and his staff allegedly engaged in criminal conduct. Screenshots of video clips were included in the suit, described as being from parties in which underage girls and sex workers were present.Jones alleged that Combs was attempting to groom him into having a sexual relationship with him. The lawsuit said that Combs sexually harassed and assaulted Jones while he lived at Combs’ homes in Florida, Los Angeles and New York, as well as on a yacht Combs rented in the U.S. Virgin Islands.A property belonging to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs at Star Island in Miami Beach on March 25.Giorgio Viera / AFP - Getty ImagesJones alleged that he and another man, Brendan Paul, were asked to travel with drugs and firearms on Combs’ behalf.In amended filings, Jones additionally accused Combs and his son of being involved in a 2022 shooting at a Los Angeles recording studio, which both men denied.An attorney for Combs said Jones’ “reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.”March 2024: Combs’ homes searched by federal agentsOn March 25, agents with Homeland Security Investigations raided Combs’ properties in Los Angeles and Miami. Three sources familiar with the matter told NBC News that firearms were found at his residences, but no additional details were provided.At the time of the raids, Combs was on his way to a scheduled trip to the Bahamas and was stopped at a Miami airport prior to departure. Officials seized his cellphones, sources said.Dyer, one of Combs’ attorneys, issued a statement following the raids and said that Combs “was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities.” He described the raid as an ambush, saying there’s been a rush to judgment based on “meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits.”“There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations,” Dyer said. “Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.”Brendan Paul, 25, was arrested at the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport at the same time Combs was stopped at the airport. A law enforcement source familiar with the matter confirmed that Paul is a Combs associate. It is currently unclear whether the arrest was related to the raids.Paul was named as an employee of Combs’ in Jones’ suit, which described him as someone who acquires and distributes drugs and guns on Combs’ behalf. Combs allegedly required Paul and others he paid to carry black pouches that contained drugs such as ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine, marijuana and mushrooms.A Miami-Dade police report showed Paul was charged with possession of suspected cocaine and suspected marijuana candy, and court records show he was bonded out of custody the next day.According to the police report, local law enforcement was with agents from Homeland Security and customs officers at the time of Paul’s arrest. The contraband items were found in Paul’s travel bags, the report said.Paul’s attorney, Brian Bieber, told NBC News, “We do not plan on trying this case in the media — all issues will be dealt with in Court.” A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Paul hung up on an NBC News reporter.",[]

The declaration is set to last 90 days and can be renewed if necessary.Puerto Rico joins Brazil, Peru and other Latin American nations dealing with outbreaks in declaring a state of emergency over dengue fever.As of Tuesday, there have been over 3.5 million cases and more than 1,000 deaths in Latin America, the Pan American Health Organization said at a news briefing Thursday. “This is cause for concern, as it represents three times more cases than those reported for the same period in 2023,"" which was considered a record year, PAHO Director Jarbas Barbosa said.The Puerto Rico Department of Health reported first noticing an increase in dengue fever cases on the island at the end of 2023. With 146 cases reported by the third week of January, dengue fever rates started to consistently surpass 2023 levels.As of March 10, at least 549 dengue fever cases had been reported on the island since the start of the year, mostly in the capital of San Juan, according to the Health Department. About 62% of patients were hospitalized with the disease; only 29 cases were considered severe. No dengue fever fatalities have been reported so far.The most common symptom among those who contract the mosquito-borne disease is fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other symptoms include serious headaches, nausea, vomiting, rash and body pain.Symptoms can be mild or severe. Most dengue fever patients recover in a week, but in severe cases the disease can be life-threatening and require hospitalization since it can result in shock, internal bleeding and even death. Those who have had dengue in the past are more likely to develop severe symptoms. A person can get sick with dengue fever up to four times in their lifetime — once for each type of virus that can cause the disease, according to the CDC.The CDC has been working with the Puerto Rico Health Department and other local agencies to enact the island’s dengue fever prevention and control plan — which includes eliminating and cleaning up areas with stagnant water that could serve as mosquito breeding sites, as well as urging the public to use mosquito repellents and wire mesh panels to keep mosquitoes out of their homes.In a statement Monday, Mellado said in Spanish that all parts of Puerto Rican society must join forces to prevent contagion and the spread of this virus.Puerto Rico last declared a dengue epidemic in 2012.

Gretchen Whitmer, comes nearly two years after NBC News exposed an educational crisis that had forced vulnerable teens to repeat classes they took while living in state-funded residential facilities, delaying graduation for some and leading others to drop out. The law will, for the first time, require the state to provide children in foster care with “an education that prioritizes meeting the graduation requirements” to earn a diploma. Until now, the state had placed children in residential facilities that were required only to provide “appropriate educational services.” That vague description meant some students took substandard classes that didn’t count toward graduation. Some were enrolled in classes they’d already taken. Some discovered that their transcripts were missing or incomplete. Others were pulled out midsemester to move to a new home without consideration for whether they’d be able to finish their coursework. “We’re so excited,” said Saba Gebrai, the program director for the Park West Foundation, which supports the youth-led advocacy organization that lobbied for the legislation.“The kids have been asking for a real education,” she said, and now “there will be no confusion about what students should be doing to graduate from high school.”The law won’t take effect until next year, but Gebrai said advocates have been urging the state to start amending its contracts with residential facilities to reflect the new educational expectations. A spokesman with the state Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment.The law is part of a three-bill package that state Rep. Stephanie A. Young, a Detroit Democrat, introduced last year after seeing what she called “a truly disturbing news report” about the issue from NBC News. Whitmer signed the first two bills last month. One requires the state to track and report data on foster youths’ education. The other compels the state to “regularly review” educational programs in residential facilities to ensure they meet public school standards. “This could be a game-changer,” Young said. “Now, students don’t have to worry about, ‘Is this class going to help me graduate?’ That’s built into the system. It’s built into the law now.” The NBC News article “put a fire under me,” to make these changes, she said. Until seeing that report, “I didn’t know this was happening.” State agencies have also made changes to address the issue, including hiring employees to help foster youth navigate the education system and keep track of their credits.Christian Randle, 19, a youth advocate who was among the first to raise the issue after learning the ninth and 10th grade classes he took while living in residential facilities wouldn’t count toward graduation, praised the new laws but wishes the process had been faster.It took nearly a year for Young and her colleagues to negotiate the bills with state agencies and about 10 months to get them passed through the Legislature. “We finally got these bills passed and it’s such a relief, but then it showed me that we have some work to do. It took us two years to get just these bills passed,” Randle said. “These are real-life issues that are affecting real-life foster youth.”Randle is still working on finishing high school through an online program nearly a year after he should have graduated. Meanwhile, he said, four of his close friends have had to restart high school in the two years since he and other members of a group called Empowering Foster Youth Through Technology started lobbying for change. Now, Randle and other members of the group are pushing for additional measures, such as making it easier for youth to access their own transcripts and to quickly enroll in school after a change in placement. “This is definitely a huge achievement, but it’s just the start,” Randle said. “We’re nowhere near done.”",[]

The remaining four have not been found but are presumed dead.“All of the men were on a break in their cars when the boat hit. We don't know if they were warned before the impact,” Cervantes' wife, who did not disclose her name, told NBC News on Thursday. Mere seconds after the Dali hit the bridge, it appeared to snap and fall into the dark water below. “My husband doesn’t know how to swim. It is a miracle he survived,” the wife said. Cervantes was taken to the hospital with a chest wound and was released the same day, his wife said. The other worker rescued Tuesday was in good condition and refused treatment, authorities previously said. The remains of Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, were recovered by searchers in the Port of Baltimore on Wednesday morning. They were found in a red pickup truck trapped under 25 feet of water near what was once the middle of the bridge.Hernandez Fuentes, 35, was from Mexico and lived in Baltimore; Castillo Cabrera, 26, was from Guatemala and lived in Dundalk, Maryland. Cervantes' wife said that her brother-in-law was one of the two men whose bodies were recovered Wednesday, but did not share his name. She said her entire family is of Mexican origin, and her nephew is among the still missing. “We haven’t been able to sleep, waiting for word if they’re going to find a relative,” she said. Audio from dispatch radio, published by Broadcastify, captured the moment police officers rushed to stop traffic and close the bridge — a move that likely saved countless lives — and called for a warning to the crew working on the bridge. An officer on the dispatch audio said, “I’m not sure where, there’s a crew up there you might want to notify, whoever the foreman is, see if we can get them off the bridge temporarily.” Another officer replied saying that once another police unit arrives, “I’ll go grab the workers on the Key Bridge.”But it was too late. Moments later, another officer said over the radio: “The whole bridge just fell down! Start, start ... everybody. The whole thing just collapsed.”The collapse sent shock waves across the country, sparked supply chain concerns and broke the hearts of locals who considered the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which stretches a mile-and-a-half and carries Interstate 695, a city jewel. President Joe Biden has vowed to reconstruct the bridge as soon as possible.An investigation into what caused the crash and subsequent bridge collapse is underway by the National Transportation Safety Board. It is anticipated to take one to two years.George Solis reported from Baltimore, and Marlene Lenthang from Los Angeles.",[]

The pair’s research — which Kahneman described for lay audiences in his best-selling 2011 book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” — focused on how much decision-making is shaped by subterranean quirks and mental shortcuts that can distort our thoughts in irrational yet predictable ways.Take, for instance, false confidence in predictions. In an excerpt from his book, Kahneman described a “leaderless group” challenge used by the Israeli army’s Psychology Branch to assess future leadership potential. Eight candidates, all unknowns to one another, had to cross a six-foot wall together using only a long log — without touching the wall or the ground with the log, or touching the wall themselves.Observers of the test — including Kahneman himself, who was born in Tel Aviv and did his Israeli national service in the 1950s — confidently identified leaders-in-the-making from these challenges, only to learn later that their assessments bore little relation to how the same soldiers performed at officer training school. The kicker: This fact didn’t dent the group’s confidence in its own judgments, which seemed intuitively obvious — and yet also continued to fail at predicting leadership potential.“It was the first cognitive illusion I discovered,” Kahneman later wrote. He coined the phrase “ the illusion of validity ” to describe the phenomenon.Kahneman’s partner, Barbara Tversky — the widow of Amos Tversky — confirmed his death to The Associated Press. Tversky, herself a Stanford University emerita professor of psychology, said the family is not disclosing the location or cause of death.Kahneman’s decades-long partnership with Tversky began in 1969 when the two collaborated on a paper analyzing researcher intuitions about statistical methods in their work. “The experience was magical,” Kahneman later wrote in his Nobel autobiography. “Amos was often described by people who knew him as the smartest person they knew. He was also very funny ... and the result was that we could spend hours of solid work in continuous mirth.”The two worked together so closely that they flipped a coin to determine which of them would be the lead author on their first paper, and thereafter simply alternated that honor for decades.“Amos and I shared the wonder of together owning a goose that could lay golden eggs -– a joint mind that was better than our separate minds,” Kahneman wrote.Kahneman and Tversky began studying decision making in 1974 and quickly hit upon the central insight that people react far more intensely to losses than to equivalent gains. This is the now-common notion of “loss aversion,” which among other things helps explain why many people prefer status quo choices when making decisions. Combined with other findings, the pair developed a theory of risky choice they eventually named “prospect theory.”Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for these and other contributions that ended up underpinning the discipline now known as behavioral economics. Economists say Tversky would certainly have shared the prize had he not died in 1996. The Nobel is not awarded posthumously.",[]

They push, bump and occasionally crash out as they jostle for position on the hardwood floor.But for the women of the Long Island Roller Rebels, their biggest battle is taking place outside the suburban strip-mall roller rink where they’re girding for the upcoming roller derby season.The nearly 20-year-old amateur league is suing a county leader over an executive order meant to prevent women’s and girl’s leagues and teams with transgender players from using county-run parks and fields. The league’s legal effort, backed by the New York Civil Liberties Union, has thrust it into the national discussion over the rights of transgender athletes.Amanda Urena, the league’s vice president, said there was never any question the group would take a stand.“The whole point of derby has been to be this thing where people feel welcome,” said the 32-year-old Long Island native, who competes as “Curly Fry” and identifies as queer, at a recent practice at United Skates of America in Seaford. “We want trans women to know that we want you to come play with us, and we’ll do our very best to keep fighting and making sure that this is a safe space for you to play.”Amanda ""Curly Fry"" Urena at United Skates of America in Seaford, N.Y., on March 19, 2023. Jeenah Moon / APThe February edict from Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman affects more than 100 public facilities in the county of nearly 1.4 million just east of Queens.Sports leagues and teams seeking permits to play or practice in county-run parks must disclose whether they have or allow transgender women or girls. Any organization that allows them to play will be denied a permit, though men’s leagues and teams aren’t affected.Bills restricting trans youths’ ability to participate in sports have already passed in some 24 states as part of an explosion of anti-trans legislation on many subjects in recent years. The largest school district in Manhattan is among localities also weighing a ban, following a school board vote last week.The Roller Rebels sought a county permit this month in hopes of hosting practices and games in county-owned rinks in the upcoming season, as they have in prior years. But they expect to be denied, since the organization is open to anyone who identifies as a woman and has one transgender player already on the roster.The ban will also make it hard for the league, which has two teams and about 25 players, to recruit and will hurt its ability to host competitions with other leagues, Urena said.State Attorney General Letitia James has demanded the county rescind the ban, saying it violates state anti-discrimination laws, while Blakeman has asked a federal judge to uphold it.That a roller derby league has become the face of opposition isn’t surprising: the sport has long been a haven for queer and transgender women, said Margot Atwell, who played in a women’s league in New York City and wrote “Derby Life,” a book about roller derby.The sport, which dates at least to the 1930s and enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s, involves two teams racing around a track as their designated “jammer” attempts to score points by lapping the other skaters, who are allowed to use their hips, chests and shoulders to slow them down.The latest revival started in the early 2000s and has been sustained by LGBTQ+ people, with leagues frequently taking part in Pride parades and holding fundraising matches, Atwell said.“You come in here and you say, ‘I’m a trans woman. I’m a nonbinary person. I’m genderqueer.’ OK? We accept you,” said Caitlin Carroll, a Roller Rebel who competes as “Catastrophic Danger.” “The world is scary enough. You should have a safe place to be.”Blakeman has said he wants to ensure female athletes can compete safely and fairly. He held a news conference last week with Caitlyn Jenner, who won Olympic gold in the men’s decathlon in 1976 and later underwent a gender transition. Jenner, a Republican who’s frequently at political odds with the greater transgender community, has endorsed the ban.Blakeman, a Republican who was elected in 2021, has said constituents asked his office to act. But many critics dismiss the ban as political posturing, noting he has acknowledged there have been no local complaints involving transgender players on women’s teams.“This is a solution in search of a problem,” said Emily Santosus, a 48-year old transgender woman on Long Island who hopes to join a women’s softball team. “We’re not bullies. We’re the ones that get bullied.”The ones who will suffer most aren’t elite athletes, but children still trying to navigate their gender identities, added Grace McKenzie, a transgender woman who plays for the New York Rugby Club’s women’s team.Members of the Long Island Roller Rebels during practice at United Skates of America in Seaford, N.Y., on March 19, 2023.Jeenah Moon / AP“Cruel is the only word that I can use to describe it,” the 30-year-old Brooklyn resident said. “Kids are using sports at that age to build relationships, make friendships, develop teamwork skills, leadership skills and, frankly, just help shield them from all the hate they face as transgender kids already.”In the larger discussion about trans women in sports, each side points to limited research to support their opinion. And bans often do not distinguish between girls and women who took puberty blockers as part of their transition — stunting the development of a male-typical physique — and those who didn’t, something one New York advocate pointed out.The order in Nassau County puts some younger trans girls at greater risk by potentially pitting them against boys instead, said Juli Grey-Owens, leader of Gender Equality New York.“They are not hitting puberty, so they’re not growing, they’re not getting that body strength, the endurance, the agility, the big feet, the large legs,” Grey-Owens said.The ban could even lead to cisgender female athletes who are strong and muscular being falsely labeled transgender and disqualified, as has happened elsewhere, said Shane Diamond, a transgender man who plays recreational LGBTQ+ ice hockey in New York City.“It creates a system where any young woman who doesn’t fit the stereotypical idea of femininity and womanhood is at risk of having her gender questioned or gender policed,” Diamond said.A 2022 Washington Post-University of Maryland Poll found that 55% of Americans were opposed to allowing trans women and girls to compete with other women and girls in high school sports, and 58% opposed it for college and pro sports.Two cisgender female athletes said after listening to Jenner that men are stronger than women, so it will never be fair if transgender women and girls are allowed to compete.“There is a chance I would get hurt in those situations,” said Trinity Reed, 21, who plays lacrosse at Nassau County’s Hofstra University.Mia Babino, 18, plays field hockey at the State University of New York at Cortland and plans to transfer to Nassau County’s Molloy University.“We’ve worked very hard to get to where we are and to play at a college level,” she said.But that attitude runs against everything athletic competition stands for, and it sells women and their potential short, countered Urena, of the Roller Rebels.“If people gave up playing sports because they thought they were going to lose, we wouldn’t have a sports industry,” they said. “I love playing against people that are faster and stronger because that’s how I get better.”",[]

""And for a tragedy like this to happen to us, can you imagine?” With 1,056 fatalities, workers in the construction and extraction industries had the second most fatalities in 2022, followed by transportation and material moving workers, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released in December.At least 423 of these workers died due to falls, slips or trips, according to BLS. The majority of these deaths, at least 286, happened among Hispanic workers.The fatality rate of construction and extraction workers increased from 12.3 deaths per 100,000 full-time employee workers in 2021 to 13.0 a year later.A total of 316 of foreign-born Hispanic construction workers died of workplace injuries in 2022, according to BLS.Miguel Luna and Maynor Suazo are among the missing construction workers following the Baltimore bridge collapse.Family photosOther tragedies involving Hispanic construction workers have already taken place this year.In another Maryland town about 10 miles west of Baltimore, at least three Latinos were among the six construction workers fatally struck by two drivers while in a construction zone doing roadwork in Woodlawn over the weekend.Two months ago in Idaho, three construction workers, two of which were from Guatemala, were killed in a building collapse in the town of Boise.'Part of the very fabric' of BaltimoreThe Baltimore bridge collapse tragedy has hit Latino and immigrant communities nationwide hard, said Bruna Sollod, senior political director of United We Dream, the nation’s largest immigrant youth-led organization.Sollod said in a statement Wednesday that immigrant workers like the six men who remain missing in Baltimore “have been building and repairing the bridges that ensure we can move freely throughout the cities we call home and stay connected as neighbors and families.”“Each and every single one of these men were a part of the very fabric that helps make Baltimore a thriving, vibrant, and safer community,” Sollod said, adding that they are “a reminder of the often unseen care immigrants pour into our cities and communities every day.”In addition to being a construction worker, Luna was a member of CASA, one of the most prominent immigrant advocacy groups in the state of Maryland.""He is a husband, a father of three, and has called Maryland his home for over 19 years,"" Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA, said in a statement. ""Miguel Luna, from El Salvador, left at 6:30 p.m. Monday evening for work and since, has not come home.""The organization is working with the affected families to provide them support, Torres added.Moisés Díaz, another Brawner Builders construction worker who was friends with Suazo and Luna, said he used to work on the same shift in which his friends presumably died but switched shifts to make space in his schedule to attend church.""They were great husbands, fathers, sons,"" Díaz told NBC News. ""We are very worried.""Traffic into the Francis Scott Key Bridge was closed off after authorities received a distress call from the cargo ship after it had lost power — effectively preventing a larger or more deadly disaster. The crash happened less than five minutes later.Campos said he believes little could have been done to safely evacuate his co-workers.""Everything happened in the blink of an eye and that wasn't possible,"" Campos told Telemundo 44 in Spanish.For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

The audio also captures the moment the quick-thinking officers stopped traffic and closed the bridge, saving countless lives — actions that saw them hailed as heroes by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott on Wednesday.Two of the six construction workers who were missing, presumed dead, were recovered from the Patapsco River on Wednesday, in a red pick-up truck 25 feet under water.Police named them as 35-year-old Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes,  originally from Mexico, and 26-year-old Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, originally from Guatemala. Family and friends described them as devoted husbands, fathers and workers. A search operation continues for the missing four.""I need one of you guys on the south side, one of you guys on the north side, hold all traffic on the Key Bridge — there is a ship approaching that has lost its steering. So until you get that under control, we got to stop all traffic,"" one officer says on the dispatch.The same officer then asks: ""Is there a crew working on the bridge right now?"" The container ship Dali, rests against wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge as seen from Pasadena, Md., on Wednesday.Alex Brandon / APHe continues: ""I'm not sure where, there's a crew up there you might want to notify, whoever the foreman is, see if we can get them off the bridge temporarily.""Another officer replies to say that once another police unit arrives, ""I'll go grab the workers on the Key Bridge.""Moments later another officer says over the radio: ""The whole bridge just fell down! Start, start ... everybody. The whole thing just collapsed.""The bridge came down in a matter of seconds, as dramatic video showed. But the Dali's fateful voyage had begun 50 minutes earlier.The enormous cargo ship, measuring almost 1,000 feet, left the port of Baltimore at 12:39 a.m. on Tuesday, according to a timeline from the NTSB.The ship entered the channel at 1:07 and by 1:24 had reached a speed of 8 knots, or 9.2 mph.At 1:24, multiple alarms can be heard on the ship's audio.Two minutes later, the ship's pilot called for any nearby tug boats to assist and called the Maryland Transport Authority (MDTA) to report the loss of control.At 1:27, the pilot ordered the boat to drop its port anchor and continued to make steering commands. At this point the pilot radioed to say he had lost all power and was approaching the bridge.The MDTA was able to radio police units on both sides of the bridge to stop traffic, as the ship continued at less than 7 knots, or 8 mph.The ship's audio captured the moment of impact at 1:29 — the ship's pilot reported the bridge coming down at the same time.As Baltimore, Maryland and the country come to terms with the loss of six lives, a famous landmark and important economic infrastructure, attention turns to the investigation into how and why the enormous Dali cargo ship suddenly lost power, and how the bridge crumbled so quickly.The Dali had routine maintenance while it was in the Port of Baltimore, but no issues were flagged, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Shannon Gilreath said Wednesday.""So as far as the engine goes, we were not informed of any problems with the vessel,"" he said at a news conference. ""We were informed that they were going to conduct routine engine maintenance on it while it was in port. And that’s the only thing we were informed about that vessel in that regard.""National Transport Safety Board Chair Jennifer L. Homendy and a team of investigators boarded the ship Wednesday to interview crew and gather evidence. The NTSB has recovered the data recorder, which will provide a huge range of data, including the ship's exact position and its systems status at the time of the collision.But Homendy has warned that the investigation will be a huge undertaking and could take one to two years. Meanwhile, one of the biggest ports on the eastern seaboard remains shut, depriving suppliers of a major route for consumer goods, including automobiles, that normally accounts for 4,900 trucks and billions of dollars of trade daily.",[]
tech,False,Neutral,"['Black', 'the Office of Management and Budget', 'OMB', 'OMB', 'Pew Research Center', 'the National Association of Latino', 'OMB', 'OMB', 'OMB', 'the Interagency Committee on Race and Ethnicity Statistical Standards', 'OMB', 'NBC']",Census will offer Hispanic or Latino and Middle Eastern or North African race categories for the first time,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/hispanic-latino-middle-eastern-north-african-new-race-categories-rcna145376,2024-03-28T12:45:05.290Z,"For the first time, Hispanic or Latino is listed as one race/ethnicity category and people of Middle Eastern or North African descent will have their own checkbox under new race and ethnicity standards adopted by the Biden administration.  Up to now, Hispanics had a two-part question for their identity: They were asked whether they were Hispanic or Latino and then asked to pick a race of white, Black, American Indian or some other race. The change now uses one question for race and ethnicity and allows people to check as many as apply to their identity.  Each category has subcategories with examples that may apply and room for those that may not be listed.The addition of a Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA, identifier would allow 7 million to 8 million people to no longer have to identify as “white” or “other” on the census and other forms in which such data is collected. The changes are only the second update by the federal government to categories for data about the American population. The update — the last was in 1997 — of standards used by the federal government for the census and other agencies is meant to better capture the expanding multicultural identity of the country. “These updated standards are going to help us create more useful, accurate and up-to-date federal data on race and ethnicity,” said an official with the Office of Management and Budget, who spoke to reporters Tuesday on the condition that the person not be identified. “And these revisions will enhance our ability to compare information and data across federal agencies and also understand again how our federal programs are serving a diverse America,” the official said. The changes were effective Thursday, and agencies have 18 months to devise plans for complying and then up to five years to put those plans in place, though some are likely to do so sooner, the OMB said.The newest standards reflect results from the 2020 census that showed that most Hispanics did not identify their race as white, Black or Asian and instead were more likely to choose ""some other race"" on the decennial survey or to check ""two or more races.""Research showed that the two-part question is confusing and that since 1980, nonresponse to the race question has increased, the OMB said in an explanation of its recommendations. On the 2020 census, 4 in 10 Hispanics, or 42%, marked “some other race. A third selected two or more racial groups, and 20% chose white as their race, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.The two new categories will have subcategories; the ones listed for Hispanic or Latino are ""Mexican, Puerto Rican, Salvadoran, Cuban, Dominican, Guatemalan and other Central or South American or Spanish culture or origin.""Arturo Vargas, chief executive officer of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, praised the revised standards, calling them “long overdue and critical step toward ensuring our nation collects the most complete and accurate data possible on the Latino community.” But he also expressed concern that ""OMB is being very prescriptive in how to ask the question"" about race by designating subcategories and ""not allowing for flexibility to reflect new research and improve questions in the short term."" He said there is a need to signal to Latinos who may, for example, identify as Black or African that they should mark that box, as well. For the Middle Eastern or North African category, the subcategories are listed as “Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi, Israeli etc.” Labels considered derogatory and racist, such as “Negro” and “Far East,” were eliminated. Asian is now defined as ""individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of Central or East Asia, Southeast Asia or South Asia, including, for example, Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese.”Black or African American now includes people with origins in Africa, including ""for example African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian, Ethiopian and Somali.""The new standards also remove the use of ""majority"" and ""minority"" as descriptors of specific groups. Some in the Afro Latino or Black Latino population had raised concerns that the combined question would dilute their visibility.  After the new race categories were announced, the Afro-Latino Coalition said a statement: ""By listing Latino ethnicity as co-equal with racial categories, Latinos are inaccurately portrayed as a population without racial differences, despite all the research showing how Black Latinos are treated differently from other Latinos.""The OMB said its research showed Afro Latino populations estimates were slightly higher with a combined race/ethnicity question that also provides detailed checkboxes and write-in fields. But the working group recommended more research into the issue because about half of Afro Latinos interviewed during research for the update chose only Hispanic or Latino on a combined question, even though they selected the Hispanic or Latino and Black or African American categories when they were recruited for the interviews. Although the standards are intended for federal agencies, the effect goes beyond that realm. Many researchers, local and state governments and nonprofit groups follow the standards, which also shape policy and affect representation in government through redistricting and, in some ways, societal perspectives. The revisions were developed by a working group made up of career staff members from 35 agencies, which received more than 20,000 comments after first recommending the changes in January 2023, according to the OMB. The working group held 94 ""listening sessions,"" three virtual town halls and a tribal consultation about its proposed revisions, the agency said. In addition, the OMB said it is creating the Interagency Committee on Race and Ethnicity Statistical Standards to continue research, because the process of updating the standards ""showed that racial and ethnic identities, concepts and data needs continue to evolve."" Along with researching and capturing accurate data about Afro Latinos, it will also consider collecting data about descendants of people enslaved in the U.S., among other topics. The OMB said groups consulted on identification of descendants of slaves did not agree on whether or how to collect the information. The others race and ethnicity categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Middle Eastern or North African, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and White.

One woman said she was assaulted walking home from class. Another said she was assaulted on her way to work. A third woman said she was attacked walking her dog. At least two of the women described suspects with similar characteristics. New York police said they made an arrest in one of the incidents and are investigating another. While police wouldn’t confirm that the incidents described in the TikTok videos are those they are investigating, they shared that they’re looking into cases that are very similar to accounts posted on social media.  Officials said it’s unclear whether the two incidents they are investigating are connected. The videos have circulated amid widespread perceptions in the U.S. that crime is rising, despite recent FBI data that suggests it decreased last year. Concerns over public safety have continued to loom in New York City. A series of recent high-profile crimes in the subway system prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to send National Guard members to some of the busiest stations.In February, police reported a decrease in shootings, murders and other crimes, like grand larceny, as opposed to February of last year. However, there was a 3.6% uptick in felony assault, with 1,968 incidents reported to police last month. According to crime statistics for this past week, misdemeanor assault is up 10.3% from this time last year, and it has gone up 15.7% in the past two years. A police spokesperson declined to answer any additional questions about the recent assault incidents, including whether they represent an uptick in violent crime against women in the city or whether the police department is taking any additional measures to ensure their safety.Sarah Harvard, 30, was among the women who shared her experience online after she saw other women post videos. Harvard, who posted Tuesday on X, said she was walking to her comedy gig on the Lower East Side when she was punched in the back of the head near the Delancey Street and Essex Street station the evening of March 19. “I was not on my phone. I was walking somewhere, and I got attacked from behind,” she told NBC News. “So it’s really violating that I didn’t see it coming and there was nothing I could’ve done, really, to prevent it from happening.”She described experiencing a “spiky pain, throbbing feeling” in her head as she was walking home after the incident. The rest of the night, she said, she had nausea, headaches, dizziness and blurry vision.Harvard said she initially didn’t go to the police because she thought that it was an isolated incident and that officials might brush it off. Since she learned that more women have come forward online to say they’ve been assaulted, she said, she plans to file a police report. Since the attack, Harvard said, she is struggling with feeling unsafe in the city she calls home.“What’s really unbearable is that general never-ending feeling now of feeling unsafe and feeling constantly alert, constantly looking over my shoulder,” she said. “This anxiety is manifesting physically, too. I slept last night for two hours; the night before, I slept for four hours. I’m having trouble breathing, and my chest is getting really tight.”In their TikTok videos, women have echoed similar sentiments describing their interactions with their alleged assailants. A woman said she was walking out of the Times Square subway station on Saturday when a man came up to her and punched her in the head.The woman said she was able to capture video of the man, as he was walking away. Police said the 25-year-old woman was attacked on 7th Avenue and West 42 Street. Police publicized in a poster how the suspect was wanted for assault. The woman said on TikTok the ""traumatic"" experience will stick with her the ""rest of my life.""""We are always cautious about walking at night, now we have to be cautious about walking in broad daylight,"" she said.Mikayla Toninato, a Parsons fashion design student, also shared a TikTok video saying she was punched in the face while leaving class in Manhattan as she was looking down at her phone and texting. “Out of nowhere this man just came up and hit me in the face,"" she said in the clip, with a bruise visible under one of her eyes.“He hit me right on my cheekbone. This doesn’t hurt as bad as the concussion does,” she said in an interview aired Thursday on NBC's ""TODAY"" show.Dealing with the aftermath has also been emotionally taxing. ""It’s been really really hard,"" she said. ""I think it hits me in waves. A lot of crying because it’s been really scary.""Another woman said she was walking Monday when a man punched her in the face, causing a big lump to develop on her head.“You guys, I was literally just walking and a man came up and punched me in the face,” she said tearfully in a TikTok video. “Oh, my God, it hurts so bad. I can’t even talk.”The woman didn’t say where exactly she was when she was assaulted. NBC News conducted a geolocation of where she was walking in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Police said an incident happened at 10:20 a.m. in the area of West 16th Street and 7th Avenue when “an unknown individual hit her in the head.”“The victim fell to the ground and suffered injuries to the left side of her face. The victim was treated at a local medical facility,” police said in a report shared with NBC News.She shared an update to TikTok in which she said she was looking at her phone when a man walking a dog assaulted her.“There was so much room on the sidewalk, and, like, literally nobody was around, and I guess this man — I don’t know if he punched me or if he elbowed me. I literally passed out,” she said. “So I don’t really remember, but I think he just was really mad that my head was down.”Skiboky Stora, 40, of Brooklyn, was arrested Wednesday on an assault charge in connection with the incident, police said.Stora has sought public office in New York since 2021, public records show. He participated in a New York City mayoral debate in 2021. In 2022, he filed a handwritten petition to get on the ballot for New York governor. Last year, records show, Stora ran for the District 9 seat on the New York City Council.Stora and the suspect wanted in the assault outside the Times Square subway station on Saturday, do not appear to be the same person.Over a week before the Monday assault, in an area just over a mile south from where that victim was, another woman reported getting punched by a man who apologized before he hit her.“I literally just got punched by some man on the sidewalk,” the woman said in a TikTok video. “He goes ‘Sorry’ and then punches me in the head.”Police say an incident happened at around 11:48 a.m. March 17 while a woman was walking her dog in the area of Kenmare and Mulberry streets. “No injuries were reported as a result of this incident,” police said in a report.In an update posted to her TikTok account, the woman addressed questions she received about what she was doing leading up to the assault.“I wasn’t looking down at my phone,” she said. “I was just literally across the street from my building walking my dog to the dog park. I had seen the man. He was, like, slightly walking toward me, and I didn’t think anything of it. And then he says, ‘Sorry,’ and hits me and was immediately gone.”She said a woman who witnessed the assault came over to help her. Neither of the women who posted on TikTok responded to requests for comment. Several others who also posted videos didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Many women online have since expressed that seeing the videos of other women sharing their alleged experiences have left them feeling uneasy.“I have never felt so unsafe in the city than I do now,” reality TV personality Melinda Melrose, who was on the show “Too Hot to Handle,” said in a TikTok video. “This is another reason why I packed all my things out of my apartment, put them in storage and I’m moving. I do not got time to end up on the news and become someone’s victim.”",[]

This new command, led by Rear Adm. Stephen D. Barnett, is charged with permanently decommissioning the tanks, cleaning up the environment and restoring the aquifer underneath.Vice Adm. John Wade, the commander of the task force that drained the tanks, said in a recorded video released Wednesday that Barnett understands “the enormity and importance” of the job.Wade said the new task force’s mission was to “safely and expeditiously close the facility to ensure clean water and to conduct the necessary long-term environmental remediation.”The military agreed to drain the tanks after the 2021 spill sparked an outcry in Hawaii and concerns about the threat the tanks posed to Honolulu’s water supply. The tanks sit above an aquifer supplying water to 400,000 people in urban Honolulu, including Waikiki and downtown.The military built the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the side of a mountain ridge to shield the fuel tanks from aerial attack. Each of the 20 tanks is equivalent in height to a 25-story building and can hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters).A Navy investigation said a series of errors caused thousands of gallons of fuel to seep into the Navy’s water system serving 93,000 people on and around the Pearl Harbor naval base in 2021. Water users reported nausea, vomiting and skin rashes.The Navy reprimanded three now-retired military officers for their roles in the spill but didn’t fire or suspend anybody.Shortly after learning of the spill, the Honolulu Board of Water Supply stopped pumping water from the aquifer that lies under the fuel tanks to prevent leaked fuel from getting into the municipal water system. The utility is searching for alternative water sources but the Pearl Harbor aquifer was its most productive as it provided about 20% of the water consumed in the city.",[]

That standoff prompted local schools to be evacuated and took hours to resolve; it led to the arrest of 30-year-old Justin Moreira.Moreira was barricaded inside a home on St. Francis Circle after a 911 call about a person holding someone else at knifepoint, police said at the time. The person escaped, but when officers arrived, at the home, Moreira allegedly opened fire on a SWAT vehicle and periodically shot near the officers who’d circled the home.State police eventually decided to send in three robots, including Roscoe, to find where in the building Moreira was holed up. Roscoe cleared the top two floors of the building, then discovered him, holding a rifle, in the basement, police said.He knocked the robot dog down, then started to walk up the stairs, but, when Roscoe righted itself and started following him up the stairs, he knocked the dog over again, then shot it three times. Its pilot lost communication with the dog.Images shared by police showed the dog shot in its side and “neck.”Moreira went on to take aim at another of the robots outside, though he missed, officials said. Police eventually took him into custody after they sent tear gas through the house.“The incident provided a stark example of the benefits of mobile platforms capable of opening doors and ascending stairs in tactical missions involving armed suspects,” state police said in a statement. “In addition to providing critically important room clearance and situational awareness capabilities, the insertion of Roscoe into the suspect residence prevented the need, at that stage of response, from inserting human operators, and may have prevented a police officer from being involved in an exchange of gunfire.”Moreira later appeared in court, where authorities said he fired more than 30 rounds during the course of the standoff. His attorney spoke briefly outside of court, calling this “a very serious case.”The day after Roscoe was shot, police brought it to its manufacturer, Waltham-based Boston Dynamics, to have the bullets removed and assess the damage, police said. The company is hoping to keep the dog for research, and state police are getting a replacement.A Boston Dynamics representative confirmed in an email that the state police dog “was the first Spot robot to be shot while ‘on duty.’“More than that though, Spot keeps people out of harm’s way and aids first responders in assessing dangerous situations. We are proud that Spot safely supported the Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad during the recent Barnstable incident involving an armed and barricaded suspect, and we are relieved that the only casualty that day was our robot. It’s a great example of how mobile robots like Spot can be used to save lives,” the email continued.The company notes that its robots are not allowed to be weaponized.The company also noted the incident in a blog post released this week about its Spot robots, noting that they have “proven extremely valuable in hostage situations, which are, of course, inherently volatile and present a real risk of imminent danger.”The company said it’s a way to get officials a close look at such situations without putting humans at risk. Referring to Roscoe, they said simply that the “suspect fired at both responding officers and at Spot, partially disabling the robot. Officers were ultimately able to safely arrest the suspect.”",[]

The suit, filed on behalf of one woman, alleges staff members at NorthShore Medical Group and Swedish Covenant Hospital, now both operated by Endeavor Health, concealed complaints about the former doctor’s behavior for years leading up to his conviction and “knowingly gave him a platform to sexually abuse” hundreds more patients.“Women reported. They reported again and again and again,” attorney Symone Shinton said at a news conference Tuesday announcing the suit. “They were told to question their very experiences as women. They were told that the very abuse that they complained about was medically necessary and normal.”Fabio Ortega.Cook County Sheriff's OfficeThe suit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court on behalf of a woman identified only as “Jane Doe 300,” described the alleged experiences of several unnamed patients dating as far back as 1989, saying Ortega performed “unnecessary pelvic exams” and asked “patients intrusive questions about their sex life.”Stinar Gould Grieco & Hensley, the Chicago-based law firm representing the plaintiff, said it came to the number of more than 300 alleged victims after it put out legal ads about Ortega and received responses.In the case of Jane Doe 300, who the suit stated saw Ortega twice in 2017 when she was 22 and pregnant, Ortega assaulted her “under the guise of performing ‘vaginal examinations.’”She was one of Ortega’s last patients before he was arrested, according to the complaint. When Jane Doe 300’s husband asked why they were getting a new doctor in the middle of the pregnancy, NorthShore hospital’s employees repeatedly told them the doctor was simply “unavailable,” according to the suit.The hospital “withheld its knowledge that Ortega was then the subject of a criminal investigation for sexually abusing his patients,” the suit adds.In the case of another alleged victim, who the suit said was pregnant at the time, Ortega inserted “his fingers into her vagina, comparing his fingers to the size of her husband’s penis.”And in the alleged case of a 40-year-old woman who was referred to Ortega after she experienced heavy bleeding, the lawsuit says Ortega used his fingers to stimulate her and “asked her questions including but not limited to, whether she was satisfied with her sex life and if she had anal sex.”The lawsuit also described how patients allegedly reported abuse to unnamed nursing assistants and family doctors and, in one instance in 2004, to Chicago police. The Chicago Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In November 2004, the suit said, Ortega “asked for a one-year leave of absence without explanation,” after which he allegedly resumed treating patients.Most of Ortega’s alleged victims, the lawsuit says, were Latina and spoke little, if any, English. They were sent to him for treatment, attorneys said, because he spoke Spanish.For a 48-year-old woman from Mexico who is one of the alleged victims anonymously quoted in the lawsuit, the case has resurrected painful memories she had buried years ago. NBC News does not normally identify victims of sexual assault, and the woman asked to remain anonymous because, she said, she has not told her two adult daughters about her experiences. She said she began seeing Ortega when she was an 18-year-old newlywed, pregnant with her first child.She was angry, the woman said about the lawsuit. “Because [the hospitals] knew what was going on.”Ortega was sentenced to three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing two patients; he has since been released. Requests for comment from Ortega and attorneys who represented him in previous cases were not immediately returned.Endeavor Health declined to comment on pending litigation or specific allegations but said its hospitals have “absolutely no tolerance for abuse of any kind.”“We recognize the tremendous strength and courage it takes for survivors of abuse to come forward. We believe trust is earned, and we will always look for opportunities to demonstrate our commitment to the highest standards of safety and quality in our care,” it said in a statement. “We have enhanced and continue to improve and evolve our processes and policies to ensure we have an environment that supports reporting of threatened or actual abuse. Our policies require we investigate all allegations of abuse that are reported to us, take prompt action in all matters and fully cooperate with law enforcement.” Stinar Gould Grieco & Hensley also represented victims of former USA gymnastics doctor and convicted sexual predator Larry Nassar.In this case, attorneys allege hospitals ignored complaints because patients were Latina and did not speak English.“Sadly what’s commonly seen is that minority patients are silenced by health care providers when they raise concerns or issue complaints,” said Parker Stinar, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Ortega “knew that these patients would trust his white coat.”Stinar said Tuesday that while this first suit is filed on behalf of only one of more than 300 alleged victims, additional lawsuits are coming. He would not say how many or what amount in damages the firm would ultimately seek.He added his team is not pursuing a class-action case because that tactic earns every plaintiff the same amount in damages.“How could you say that Jane Doe One’s damages for sex abuse are the same as Jane Doe Two?” Stinar said. “Everyone experiences, at the time, physically, emotionally, and different lifelong traumas. They can’t be lumped together.”NBC News, in its inquiries Tuesday, asked Endeavor Health whether either hospital attempted to alert Ortega’s patients when he was first charged in 2021 with sexually abusing two of them.Endeavor Health did not respond to that query.“The hospitals, I feel like they don’t care about us as Spanish or women or Latinas,” said the woman from Mexico who spoke to NBC News. “You teach your kids to be careful when they go out. You know, to walk alone, to go in a car with strangers. But how can you prevent this, tell them be afraid of your doctor?”",[]

The number of syphilis cases among people ages 55 and up increased seven-fold during those 10 years, while gonorrhea cases increased nearly five-fold and chlamydia cases more than tripled during that time. A presentation to be delivered Thursday — part of a lead-up event to the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases next month — warns that both doctors and older adults are overlooking the risks of STIs in this age group. “We talk about smoking, we talk about diet, exercise, so many things, and not about sex at all,” said Justyna Kowalska, the author of the presentation and a professor of medicine at the Medical University of Warsaw. The issue is not limited to the U.S. In England, surveillance data published in 2022 suggested that STI diagnoses rose 22% from 2014 to 2019 among people ages 45 and up. Chlamydia was the most common, followed by gonorrhea. Kowalska pointed to a few factors that may be driving up STI rates among older adults.For one, people are living longer compared to past generations and enjoying more active lifestyles in their 60s, 70s and 80s. For many, that includes sex. A 2018 survey from AARP and the University of Michigan estimated that 40% of people ages 65 to 80 are sexually active, and nearly two-thirds are interested in sex. Hormone replacement therapy, which can treat symptoms of menopause, can prolong sexual desire in older women, while erectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra can help older men remain sexually active.But older adults may not have gotten the type of sex education provided to teenagers today, according to Matthew Lee Smith, an associate professor at the Texas A&M School of Public Health.""Back in the '30s, the '40s, the '50s, traditional school wasn’t really doing sexual education very formally,"" said Smith, who studies behavioral health risks in older adults.Smith's research has shown that older adults lack some knowledge about STI transmission, symptoms and prevention.He said doctors can be sheepish about asking older patients about their sexual activity, and older people often aren’t inclined to discuss their sex lives with peers or family members.“No one wants to think about grandma doing this,” Smith said. “You certainly aren’t going to ask grandma if she was wearing condoms — and that’s part of the problem, because every individual regardless of age has the right to intimacy.”Some older men may struggle with condom use, Smith said, because of either a lack of dexterity or erectile dysfunction.What's more, he added, many older adults married at a younger age than is typical now and only had one sexual partner until they divorced or were widowed. So some might not think to use a condom, Smith said — especially since pregnancy isn’t a concern. Nursing homes also create opportunities for new sexual partners. The results of a U.S. survey of nursing home directors, published in 2016, found that sexual activity was common in these settings, which often have more female than male residents.“In the heterosexual, older adult community, there’s a partner gap: Women live longer than men and there’s a larger proportion of females to men,” Smith said. “What it can lead to oftentimes is multiple partners and sharing of partners.”Though STIs pose health risks to all age groups, older people may have a harder time clearing infections or be more susceptible to contracting them in the first place, medical experts said.“The immune system is weaker, so you can get an infection easier, but there’s other physical things related to just sexual intimacy that make one more susceptible,” said Ethan Morgan, an assistant professor of epidemiology at The Ohio State University College of Nursing. Among women who are postmenopausal, for instance, the vaginal lining is more prone to tearing, which makes it easier for an infection to occur.The experts stressed that doctors need to do a better job of discussing safe sex with older patients.“We want them to have their best life,"" Smith said, ""but we want them to have it safely.""",[]

Gregory McMichael; his son, Travis McMichael, and their neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan, were found guilty of murder in a Georgia state court in November 2021. They were sentenced to life in prison. After a federal trial, they were found guilty of hate crimes and other charges in February 2022. They did not appear in court Wednesday. From left, Gregory McMichael, William ""Roddie"" Bryan and Travis McMichael during their trial at Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick, Ga.PoolThe hate crimes trial centered on the three men’s racial bias — a motive that prosecutors in the state case largely avoided. Arbery’s family and civil rights leaders have likened his death to a modern-day lynching. His death, along with the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd at the hands of police in 2020, ignited furor over the shooting deaths of Black people and sparked international protests against racial injustice. In a legal brief filed ahead of Wednesday's arguments, prosecutors said: “As to why defendants chased, trapped, and ultimately killed Arbery, the evidence at trial showed that they held longstanding hate and prejudice toward Black people, while also supporting vigilante justice.”The three men’s attorneys argue that evidence of past racist comments they made didn’t prove a racist intent to harm. The attorneys also argued that the hate crime conviction should be thrown out because Arbery was not killed on a public street, which they said is required for the defendants to be found guilty under federal law. Travis McMichael’s appeals attorney Amy Lee Copeland said Wednesday before the judges from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and in an earlier legal brief, that prosecutors had not proven that the streets of the Satilla Shores neighborhood where Arbery was killed were public roads, as the men’s indictment charged.Judge Elizabeth Branch responded that a county official in Glynn County, where the neighborhood is, testified that the streets in Satilla Shores are officially designated public streets. A.J. Balbo, Gregory McMichael’s attorney, said his client pursued Arbery because he had seen Arbery on a security camera video, not simply because he was Black. Balbo conceded that Gregory McMichael’s actions displayed “a hypervigilantism.” Before he was killed, Arbery was recorded on security camera videos entering a neighboring home under construction on multiple occasions. None of the videos showed him stealing.Bryan’s attorney, Pete Theodocion, challenged the attempted kidnapping charge that all three men were convicted of. The government, he said, had to prove that the defendants attempted to confine Arbery against his will and hold him for a benefit. “You have to be acting out of a want of a personal benefit,” he said, as he argued that the three men went after Arbery to protect the community from someone they believed had committed a crime. “The benefit here I think the government alleged was vigilantism, the jury apparently decided that that among other things was the case,” Judge Britt Grant responded. Branch told Theodocion that she was not sure why a benefit that extends to the community would not also include the defendants, as they were members of the community.Prosecutor Brant Levine urged the judges to uphold the hate crime convictions. “I’d like to begin by focusing on what this case is really about, that Mr. Arbery would be alive today had he not been a Black man running on the streets of Satilla Shores,” he said. Levine said that there is sufficient evidence to support each guilty verdict and that the defendants would not have acted criminally had they merely questioned Arbery if they believed he looked suspicious in their neighborhood. “Had the McMichaels driven up to Ahmaud and said, ‘Excuse me, can we talk to you about what you were doing in that house?’ we wouldn’t be here today,” Levine said. “We’re here today because when they went up to Ahmaud, they pulled out their guns, they yelled at him to get on the ground and they chased him. Roddie Bryan blocked his exit from the neighborhood, so he couldn’t leave until, in Greg McMichael’s words, they trapped him like a rat.”He added: “Why did they take those extreme measures? Why did they terrorize Ahmaud for nearly five minutes?”Levine also argued that prosecutors had proven that Arbery was killed on public roads.About three dozen people, including members of Arbery’s family and others from the community, attended a rally outside the courthouse to protest the appeal.“This hate crimes conviction is so important because it’s the first federal hate crimes conviction in the state of Georgia,” Gerald Griggs, president of Georgia NAACP, said in an interview after the rally. “And so we need to make sure we underscored the reason why people were protesting, the reason why we marched and we voted.” Marcus Arbery thanked those who had supported his family since his son’s death. Arbery’s aunt, Diane Jackson, said the appeal had reignited pain for her family. “I am so hurt still because when we saw what happened at first, we thought this would be over with now,” she said. “The way they took my nephew’s life, this has destroyed my family.” On Feb. 23, 2020, Gregory McMichael and Travis McMichael armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck after they saw him running through their neighborhood in Brunswick. Bryan joined the chase in a separate pickup truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery in the street. After the video leaked online, it thrust the case into the national spotlight and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. The video drew widespread outrage and raised concerns about why it took law enforcement officials more than two months to make arrests.The appellate judges did not say when they would rule. If the U.S. appeals court overturns any of their federal convictions, the McMichaels and Bryan would remain in prison.",[]

Most of the infections are connected to the ongoing outbreak that began at a migrant shelter in the Pilsen neighborhood. Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw nine cases from December to January. Florida's most recent measles case was recorded Friday, bringing the state's total to 11. However, the outbreak involving an elementary school in Broward County has ended, according to the Florida Health Department.Though disease experts have expressed concern about the early rise in cases, the U.S. isn’t close to its total from 2019, when the country nearly lost its measles elimination status. Most of the 1,249 cases that year were associated with outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York.Measles is highly contagious: An infected person can spread it to up to 90% of people close to them if those contacts aren’t immune. Thanks to widespread vaccination, measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 — meaning it’s no longer constantly present, though there are still occasional outbreaks. Most people who get measles now are unvaccinated. Children in the U.S. are meant to get their first vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months and their second between 4 and 6 years old. However, vaccination rates have fallen in the last few years. For nearly a decade, 95% of U.S. kindergartners had received two doses of the MMR vaccine. That rate fell to 94% in the 2020–21 year, then to 93% in the 2022–23 school year.Measles symptoms usually start with a high fever, cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and runny nose. Two to three days later, people may notice tiny white spots in their mouth. On days three to five of symptoms, a blotchy rash often forms at the hairline before spreading to the rest of the body.Some people may develop severe complications from measles, including pneumonia, swelling of the brain or a secondary bacterial infection. Before measles vaccines became available in 1963, around 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400 to 500 people died of the disease each year in the U.S. Today, 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles are hospitalized, and roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.",[]

The research paper published in the Annals of Family Medicine explored the link between what fathers know about their adolescent sons’ sexual behavior and their guidance on safe sex. They found that fathers’ perceptions of when their sons are ready for sex correlate with their advice on condom use, which often doesn't match when their sons actually begin engaging in sexual activity.Researchers from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing went into the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx and surveyed 191 Latino and Black teenagers, from 15 to 19, as well as their fathers, on the teenagers’ sexual behavior and knowledge.They found that many Latino and Black fathers often underestimated their sons’ sexual readiness. In addition to age, fathers considered other markers for maturity, such as reaching certain milestones and preparedness for safe sex, before giving guidance on condom use.“Fathers tended to underestimate that their adolescent son was sexually active, so that isn’t a good predictor. Because it means that the adolescent boy, the young person 15 to 19, could have already started having sex and their dad doesn’t realize that,” said Vincent Guilamo-Ramos, the study’s lead researcher and executive director of the Institute for Policy Solutions at the nursing school, who is also a nurse practitioner. Researchers suggest that health care providers should encourage families and parents to be pre-emptive in providing safe sex guidance, well before they perceive their sons as ready to engage in sex.Sexual activity among adolescents has dropped over the past decade, but, troublingly, so has condom use. At the same time, rates of sexually transmitted infections among young men and unplanned pregnancies among teenagers have increased, researchers pointed out.Black and Latino communities are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial or ethnic groups, with Black individuals aged 13 and up representing 40% of people with HIV and Latinos 13 and up representing 25% of people with HIV.Black and Latino adolescents, in particular, are at a unique disadvantage when it comes to accessing health care after negative sexual health outcomes, according to the study.Parental interventions have proven effective for Black and Latino families and as part of a broader tool to address sexual health inequities, researchers wrote. When parents are involved in their teenagers’ sexual education, the teens are more likely to wait to have sex or to practice safe sex.However, Guilamo-Ramos said many of his Black and Latino adolescent patients often reported that they wished their parents were more involved in their sexual education.“I was working with young men, particularly Latino and African American, and I was seeing that there were questions and they were actually areas that they wanted their fathers to actually support them with,” Guilamo-Ramos said. “Oftentimes, the fathers weren’t sure if they should have conversations with their sons about these topics, like their sexual health.”“I really want Latino and Black families to know that their fathers matter and that fathers play an important role,” Guilamo-Ramos said, “not just in terms of the economics of the household or as a disciplinarian, but that dads matter in terms of the relationship they have with their children, including their adolescent sons.”For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

The report listed a probable cause of death as “combined toxicity” from two drugs, one of which is available over the counter and the other by prescription. However, it didn’t provide any additional details regarding why the medical examiner believed the overdose was suicide. The full autopsy report notes that Benedict was involved in a physical altercation and had injuries to his head, neck, torso and limbs. These injuries, it found, were not lethal. The medical examiner also noted that Benedict’s medical history included bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, self-harm, and chronic tobacco and marijuana abuse. Benedict, who was transgender and used he and they pronouns, according to friends and family, died Feb. 8, a day after a fight at Owasso High School. Benedict had reportedly told his mother that he was bullied at school due to his gender identity. Body camera footage released by police last month shows Benedict lying in a hospital bed following the fight. In the video, he tells a police officer that three students “jumped” him after he threw water on one of them because they were bullying him and his friend for the way that they dressed.Benedict’s death has drawn international attention and ignited additional backlash from LGBTQ advocates, some of whom believe that the bullying Benedict faced is connected to the dozens of state bills targeting the community in recent years in Oklahoma and other states. In the weeks following Benedict’s death, his friends and classmates led a walkout at school to protest what they described as an unsafe environment for LGBTQ students. Tulsa County District Attorney Stephen Kunzweiler announced last Thursday that there would be no charges filed against the other students involved in the fight. Kunzweiler also noted that the contents of the notes found by Benedict’s family, which he said “do not make any reference to the earlier fight or difficulties at school,” would not be released. Nicole McAfree, executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy group Freedom Oklahoma, responded to the full autopsy with a message to Oklahoma lawmakers as the end of the state’s legislative session nears. McAfree called on them to “send a message of adamant opposition” to anti-LGBTQ legislation and policies and “support measures that enable more empathy, kindness, and compassion, not less.” McAfree added, “Nex should be alive, and the very least we can do in Nex’s memory is demonstrate our commitment to building a better world that makes it impossible for this heartbreaking tragedy to happen again.”If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or chat live at 988lifeline.org.

The no vote was Nassau County board member David Mack.The approval, essentially a rubber stamp of “clarifications” like exemptions, given the plan itself was approved last year, means congestion pricing can begin following a 60-day public information campaign and a concurrent 30-day testing period.Read more from NBC New York3 plead to $4.5M NJ romance scam that left victims ‘broke and heartbroken' Donald Trump plans to attend slain NYPD officer's wake: police spokesperson NYC solar eclipse to perfectly coincide with Yankees' April 8 home game Almost all 110 toll readers are already installed, positioning the MTA to begin collecting as soon as June 15. Federal judges on either side of the Hudson River could still block the plan, though the MTA expects that not to be the case.The board overwhelmingly voted in favor of the plan in December, saying charging drivers to enter a swath of Manhattan would contribute millions of dollars to the aging, cash-strapped transit system. Wednesday’s vote is a critical final approval of “clarifications” and exemptions.As NBC New York reported earlier this week, most of the cars likely to get full exemptions will be government vehicles. Get details on the planned exemption list here.The toll will not be in effect for taxis, but drivers will be charged a $1.25 surcharge per ride. The same policy applies to Uber, Lyft and other rideshare drivers, though their surcharge will be $2.50.Despite what MTA officials say were overwhelming public comments “in favor” of congestion pricing by a 2-to-1 margin, a number of groups have stood in opposition.Taxi advocates have blasted the plan, calling it “a reckless proposal that will devastate an entire workforce.”Public hearings earlier in March paved the way for Wednesday’s vote. For its part, the MTA has insisted that it is merely implementing a state law aimed at cleaning the air and modernizing mass transit.Charly Triballeau  / AFP via Getty ImagesHow does congestion pricing work?Congestion pricing will impact any driver entering what is being called the Central Business District (CBD), which stretches from 60th Street in Manhattan and below, all the way down to the southern tip of the Financial District. In other words, most drivers entering midtown Manhattan or below will have to pay the toll, according to the board’s report.All drivers of cars, trucks, motorcycles and other vehicles would be charged the toll. Different vehicles will be charged different amounts — here’s a breakdown of the prices:Passenger vehicles: $15Small trucks (like box trucks, moving vans, etc.): $24Large trucks: $36Motorcycles: $7.50The $15 toll is about a midway point between previously reported possibilities, which have ranged from $9 to $23.The full, daytime rates will be in effect from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. each weekday, and 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. on the weekends. The board called for toll rates in the off-hours (from 9 p.m.-5 a.m. on weekdays, and 9 p.m. until 9 a.m. on weekends) to be about 75% less — about $3.50 instead of $15 for a passenger vehicle.Drivers will only be charged to enter the zone, not to leave it or stay in it. That means residents who enter the CBD and circle their block to look for parking won’t be charged.Only one toll will be levied per day — so anyone who enters the area, then leaves and returns, will still only be charged the toll once for that day.The review board said that implementing their congestion pricing plan is expected to reduce the number of vehicles entering the area by 17%. That would equate to 153,000 fewer cars in that large portion of Manhattan. They also predicted that the plan would generate $15 billion, a cash influx that could be used to modernize subways and buses.Can I get a discount?Many groups had been hoping to get exemptions, but very few will avoid having to pay the toll entirely. That small group is limited to specialized government vehicles (like snowplows) and emergency vehicles.Low-income drivers who earn less than $50,000 a year can apply to pay half the price on the daytime toll, but only after the first 10 trips in a month.While not an exemption, there will also be so-called “crossing credits” for drivers using any of the four tunnels to get into Manhattan. That means those who already pay at the Lincoln or Holland Tunnel, for example, will not pay the full congestion fee. The credit amounts to $5 per ride for passenger vehicles, $2.50 for motorcycles, $12 for small trucks and $20 for large trucks.Drivers from Long Island and Queens using the Queens-Midtown Tunnel will get the same break, as will those using the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. Those who come over the George Washington Bridge and go south of 60th Street would see no such discount, however.Public-sector employees (teachers, police, firefighters, transit workers, etc.), those who live in the so-called CBD, utility companies, those with medical appointments in the area and those who drive electric vehicles had all been hoping to get be granted an exemption. They didn’t get one.UFT President Michael Mulgrew, one of the lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit again congestion pricing, said following the MTA approval that now it’s the courts’ job to step in.“Now that the MTA board has voted, it is going to be up to the courts to prevent the huge environmental injustice that threatens families outside the Manhattan congestion zone, including communities that are already suffering some of the worst air pollution and asthma rates in the country,” Mulgrew said.",[]

Twenty-four states limit gender-affirming care for trans youths, according to LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project. “California has been a leader in protecting the rights of transgender individuals to access care, but many states across the nation are moving in the opposite direction,” the resolution reads. “In preparation of future legislation that may criminalize those providing or seeking gender-affirming care and given the Council’s stated values of equity and inclusion, it is important for the City of Sacramento to be proactive in reiterating our commitment to transgender rights and equal protections for transgender people by declaring ourselves a sanctuary city and a place of safety for transgender people.”Proponents of the measure applauded the council’s unanimous vote.“By affirming our commitment to supporting our LGBTQ+ community and ensuring that no city resources or staff time will be used to help enforce these harmful laws in other jurisdictions, the City has taken a step beyond state law and sent a powerful signal to everyone in our community that we are a safe place for everyone,” Sacramento Councilmember Katie Valenzuela, who introduced the resolution, wrote on X. “Tonight’s testimony in support of this resolution was a powerful reminder of the resiliency and passion in our community to protect our transgender neighbors. I have never been prouder to represent this incredible city I call home.”Opponents slammed the vote, arguing that gender-affirming care can be harmful to children.“We cannot be giving children cross-sex hormones. We can’t give them surgeries to change their sex,” Beth Bourne, a member of a Sacramento chapter of Moms for Liberty, conservative group focused on school curricula, told NBC affiliate KCRA of Sacramento. “This sanctuary city is saying that we will promote the idea that people can be born in the wrong body.”As debates over whether such care should be prohibited continue in state legislatures, major U.S. medical associations — including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association — have repeatedly come out in support of transition-related care, including for some minors. The AMA and APA have both deemed it medically necessary.The Sacramento City Council is not the first governmental body to pass such a  measure aimed at safeguarding trans rights and gender-affirming care in particular. In recent years, 14 states and Washington, D.C., have passed legislation to protect access to gender-affirming care, commonly referred to as “shield laws,” according to MAP.

That afternoon, Eric Richins reached out to two of his close friends and said his wife had left him his favorite sandwich from a local diner with a note, according to the documents. He told one friend that ""you almost lost me"" and described breaking out in hives after having taken a bite from the sandwich. He said he had to use his son's EpiPen and take Benadryl, prosecutors said in the documents. ""Eric Richins told Witness 1 that he had almost died,"" the charging documents say. ""Witness 1 could hear the fear in Eric Richins’ voice and tell that Eric Richins was scared."" Eric Richins told the other friend he thought his wife had tried to poison him, prosecutors allege. The documents say opioids, including fentanyl, can cause allergic and pseudoallergic reactions, including hives. They also note that Eric Richins did not have any food allergies.  Prosecutors said in the charging documents that Kouri Richins purchased illicit fentanyl before the Valentine's Day meal in 2022 and again before his death. Kouri Richins was also charged Monday with two counts of mortgage fraud, two counts of insurance fraud and three counts of forgery. Prosecutors allege that she was in financial distress when her husband died and forged loan applications and fraudulently claimed insurance benefits after he died. An attorney for Kouri Richins said that they have reviewed the charging documents and that ""there is nothing in the documents that affects Kouri's approach to defending whatever charges the State levies against her."" ""She continues to maintain her innocence,"" the attorney said in a statement. Kouri Richins is in custody awaiting trial.",[]

J.B. Pritzker to order that procedures for dealing with situations involving domestic violence be revamped.Pritzker announced that LeAnn Miller, 63, of Junction submitted her resignation. Miller had prepared a report recommending Crosetti Brand’s release from prison.The 37-year-old felon had repeatedly violated orders of protection and threatened Laterria Smith of Chicago, police said. On March 13, investigators said that Brand went to Smith’s apartment armed with a knife and assaulted her. When her son, Jayden Perkins, intervened, Brand stabbed him to death, police said.Smith, 33, remains hospitalized in critical condition but doctors expect her and her unborn child to live. Her 6-year-old son was present during the attack but was uninjured.A message seeking comment was left at a number associated with Miller’s home and with the Prisoner Review Board. Pritzker said in a news release that she made “the correct decision in stepping down.” The Democratic governor’s spokesperson, Alex Gough, said he was unaware of Pritzker requesting her resignation.“It is clear that evidence in this case was not given the careful consideration that victims of domestic violence deserve and I am committed to ensuring additional safeguards and training are in place to prevent tragedies like this from happening again,” Pritzker said in a statement.Following board procedure, two other board members, Ken Tupy and Krystal Tison, concurred with Miller’s draft order, according to a copy of the order provided by the Prisoner Review Board in response to a public records request from The Associated Press. A phone message was left for Tupy. A number for Tison could not immediately be located.Pritzker ordered the Prisoner Review Board to “engage experts and advocates to design and implement expanded training” in domestic violence cases for the 15-member board. The board and the Department of Corrections will also review procedures for sharing information on cases involving domestic violence. Pritzker said the case might also raise issues which require legislation to broaden officials’ legal authority in such instances.Brand, who police say had a relationship with Smith 15 years ago, is charged in Cook County with first-degree murder and a half-dozen other violent felonies related to the attack. He had served half of a 16-year sentence for attacking another ex-partner in 2015 when he was paroled in October.Brand was shipped back to prison in February after being accused of repeatedly contacting Smith, who has an order of protection against him. He turned himself in after Smith reported he was at the door to her apartment on Feb. 1, repeatedly ringing the bell and pulling on the handle.But when Brand appeared before the Prisoner Review Board on Feb. 26, he denied going to her apartment and his lawyer provided evidence that his electronic monitoring bracelet did not indicate violations of his movement restrictions, according to a copy of the board’s order. He answered other reported parole violations by saying he sometimes worked late hours at a Red Lobster restaurant.The board determined there wasn’t enough evidence to verify Smith’s claims, although she was not called to testify.",[]

Thirty-eight states and Washington, D.C., now offer legal sports wagering.This year, a record number of Americans bet on the Super Bowl. Online transactions totaled nearly 15,000 per second, doubling last year’s peak, according to geolocating platform GeoComply.But as gambling has become more mainstream — and as advertising for sportsbooks spans television, streaming and social feeds — so, too, have headlines involving betting scandals and sports.In recent days, Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has found himself at the center of a $4 million betting scandal involving his interpreter and an illegal bookie. Ohtani insists he’s never bet on sports. The NBA is investigating Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter for irregularities around wagering. And U.S. Integrity, a tech firm working to combat illicit betting in college sports, flagged anomalies around the betting lines for Temple University men’s basketball games.A result of those claims: The potential to provoke outrage and public criticism that could become an inflection point for the U.S. gambling industry. There’s also the potential for gambling’s explosive growth to undermine integrity in sports and entice bettors into addiction.An estimated 2 million U.S. adults meet the criteria for a severe gambling problem, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. Another 5 million to 8 million U.S. adults are considered to have a mild or moderate gambling problem.Problem gambling prompted regulatory crackdowns in Europe and especially in the United Kingdom over the last couple years, impacting sportsbooks’ profitability and changing the way they conduct business.There has been a concerted effort in the United States for the gambling industry to police itself and ward off harsher regulatory frameworks.U.S. Rep. Paul Tonko of New York is introducing national legislation that would crack down on what he calls “a public health crisis.” Tonko’s “Supporting Affordability and Fairness with Every Bet Act,” which he introduced last week, would regulate gambling advertising, limit the number and size of deposits, and restrict how artificial intelligence is deployed to acquire customers.“Your going to have a lot more people saturated with this opportunity, with all these clever concepts of bonus bets, free bets and celebrity spokespersons,” Tonko told CNBC.An influx of gamblers will result in a dramatic increase in the number of people struggling with addiction, he said.Some states have slapped operators with fines over gaming violations. In August, Maryland fined DraftKings $94,000 for marketing to underage players. PrizePicks reached a $15 million settlement in New York for operating illegally. In Indiana, the gaming commission fined FanDuel after eight people used illegally obtained debit cards to fund their betting accounts, causing “great harm” to partners on shared bank accounts, according to the Indiana Gaming Commission Chairman Milton Thompson.Some gambling insiders are skeptical of ROGA, suspicious of what they consider a marketing stunt to address a public relations problem.Caesars, which is noticeably absent from the group founding ROGA, told CNBC it’s learned best practices from 35 years grappling with responsible gaming.“While we applaud all efforts to ensure online gaming is both operated and marketed in a responsible manner, we are confident in our [own] Responsible Gaming approach,” the company said in a statement.Caesars said it’s solely focused on the 21-and-older crowd and does not permit anyone younger than that to sign up for a Caesars rewards account, even in states like Rhode Island or Kentucky where 18-year-olds are permitted to wager.Many fantasy sports and social betting platforms that operate on a sweepstakes model permit players 18 and older, and many of Caesars’ competitors allow 18-and-up customers to play fantasy sports. Some, too, allow sports betting in that age group in the few states that permit it.But the industry is working to better insulate its youngest and most vulnerable customers.The American Gaming Association launched last March an agreement aimed at providing college-aged students protections against the marketing and advertising of sports betting.Peter Jackson, CEO of Flutter, the parent company of FanDuel, said responsible gaming comes down to good business. Yet, he warns that as legal operators come together to improve responsible gambling, the illegal marketplace will always be willing to take wagers from problem gamblers.“I urge the state regulators to help us by clamping down on some of those black market operators,” Jackson told CNBC.",[]

That’s typical of the design process,” said Sanjay R. Arwade, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “But for all structures and all engineered systems, there is a possibility that an event will occur that is beyond what the structure was designed for. And this may be one of those situations,” he added. The Francis Scott Key Bridge, a roughly 1.5-mile-long steel arch truss bridge, collapsed into the Patapsco River early Tuesday after a containership struck it. Several vehicles crashed into the water, and one of the country’s busiest ports shut down.Follow live updates on the Baltimore bridge collapseAn unknown number of workers with Brawner Builders Inc. were repairing concrete ducts when the ship, called the Dali, hit a support pillar. Six employees are presumed dead.Key Bridge was ‘fairly unprotected'Arwade said design codes for modern bridges stipulate ""what sort of loads it has to be able to resist.”“Whenever a design code is written, decisions have to be made about what the most extreme conditions are,” he said. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said the bridge was ""fully up to code.""But the Key Bridge was built in 1977, and bridge design and technology have improved since then. ""Since the 1970s, we have a lot of advancements,"" Sameh Badie, a professor of engineering at George Washington University, told NBC Washington. But he said, ""I saw today a couple of videos before the collapse, and it seems to me, structurally wise, it was very safe.""  Roberto Leon, a structural engineer at Virginia Tech, said that while engineers try to account for “extreme events” during the design and construction process, “when this bridge was built, there were no ships of this size.”“This type of load was not really considered,” he said. “So the bridge was, I would say, fairly unprotected.”Retrofitting older bridges could cost millionsOfficials have not specified what type of protective infrastructure, if any, the Key Bridge had. Leon said that on a newer bridge, large concrete structures called dolphins are often used to protect the base. Dolphins can form a kind of frame and are designed to take the impact of a vessel and “slow the ship down and redirect it away from the bridge,” he said. “In some cases, they’re called sacrificial elements, because they might be damaged beyond repair if an event of this type occurs, but of course, they save the bridge,” he added.John Pistorino, a structural engineer in Florida, said dolphins are in use to protect the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa, Florida, which was reopened in 1987, seven years after it was hit by a freighter. Thirty-five people died after the bridge collapsed into Tampa Bay.Pistorino, who was involved in the construction of the rebuilt Sunshine Skyway Bridge, described dolphins as walls or guardrails. “They can be concrete or steel … and they go all the way down to the bottom of the river,” he said. “They’re supposed to protect the abutments.” Jacksonville, Florida, Mayor Donna Deegan cited the dolphin infrastructure that's in place to protect the Dames Point Bridge — the only bridge in the city that cargo ships sail under — in a statement Tuesday. She noted that the bridge is also equipped with specialty sensors that provide real-time information about the distance between the water surface and the bottom of the bridge structure over the main channel.Older and more vulnerable bridges can be retrofitted to add defensive infrastructure like dolphins, Leon said, but building them can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.“I’m hoping that because of the infrastructure bill that passed, we are going to be able to do projects like this,” he said, referring to the $555 billion infrastructure bill that President Joe Biden signed in 2021. “Putting those into the budget and justifying them is very difficult when you have all kinds of other bridges that are in really sad shape. So it’s just a question of prioritization.”However, Kevin Heaslip, director of the Center for Transportation Research and a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said the cost of designing bridges to withstand fully loaded cargo ships like the Dali would “be so high that we wouldn’t be able to have any bridges.”The cargo ship Dali after it ran into and collapsed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Tuesday.Tasos Katopodis / Getty ImagesGovernment oversight of bridges could increaseTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he has been monitoring the situation in Baltimore. A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board has been sent to the crash site. Leon said he hopes what happened in Baltimore will cause port operations to change “quite a bit.” Pistorino said the event may lead legislators to take a closer look at vulnerable bridges in the country and the types of maritime traffic in ports.“Just like the building collapse in South Florida created a lot of legislation that required a more intimate type of building scrutiny, I think that will happen on the bridges,” he said.",[]

Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., a spokesperson for the Government Accountability Office told NBC News.Ossoff, chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on human rights and law, sent a letter asking the GAO on March 14 to open a review of how the Justice Department oversees its task forces, which often include local police officers. The request comes after NBC News published a series on the lack of accountability for federal law enforcement agencies and the local officers granted federal powers who serve on task forces.Ossoff asked the GAO to focus on the Justice Department’s main law enforcement agencies — the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the U.S. Marshals Service — “to promote clarity regarding federal policies and practices surrounding these task forces” and answer how the Justice Department provides oversight of its task forces, particularly local officers deputized with federal powers who work on the teams.GAO spokesperson Chuck Young confirmed Tuesday that the agency accepted Ossoff’s request and will begin its “in-depth examination” into federal task forces within the next few months.In December, NBC News published a series of stories examining how federal law enforcement officers harm people with little to no accountability and the contrasts between the standards local officers face when they work for their departments compared with those they are held to serving on federal task forces. One of the stories examined the steep challenges for local prosecutors trying to convict an officer from Georgia, Ossoff’s state, in the 2019 killing of Jimmy Atchison, who was fatally shot by an Atlanta police officer serving on an FBI task force.On Friday, Ossoff met with Jimmy Hill, Atchison’s father, and Gerald Griggs, president of Georgia’s NAACP. “It’s a first step in the right direction,” Hill told NBC News. “This needs to be brought to the forefront.”Atlanta Police Officer Sung Kim shot and killed Atchison, 21, who was unarmed and hiding in a neighbor’s closet, in January 2019. Atchison was wanted on a local warrant, accused of stealing an acquaintance’s purse at gunpoint. The FBI task force adopted the case. At the time, local officers on task forces were not allowed to wear body cameras. A year after the shooting, the Justice Department allowed local officers on federal task forces to start wearing the devices.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged Kim with murder in 2022. Because he was serving on a federal task force at the time, Kim successfully petitioned a federal judge to move his case to federal court, where Willis faces much longer odds of securing a conviction.Donald Samuel, Kim’s attorney, did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department also did not respond.NBC News found Atchison was one of at least 223 people shot by federal agents, task force officers or local police assisting in cases tied to Justice Department law enforcement agencies from 2018 to 2022. During that period, local prosecutors, grand juries or law enforcement agencies deemed the shootings justified 98% of the time. Only two shootings, including the Atchison case, resulted in criminal charges against on-duty officers, according to the NBC News analysis.Over the last three decades, a handful of local prosecutors have tried to convict federal agents or federal task force members of murder or manslaughter after fatal shootings. To date, none has succeeded, NBC News found. Cases typically get moved to federal court, where they are more likely to be dismissed. Federal laws and a series of Supreme Court decisions allow Kim and other local officers on federal task forces to argue that they are immune from local prosecution.Jake Best, Ossoff’s spokesperson, declined to comment. In his letter, Ossoff requested that the GAO examine which Justice Department task forces include local officers, the accountability mechanisms that apply to those officers and how the agency deals with differences between the rules those officers follow when they are serving as local or federal cops.“The law and policies governing these task forces are complicated, and conflicts can arise in their governance,” Ossoff wrote, asking, “What is known about the extent to which state and local law enforcement practices are disallowed while these enforcement officers are participating in federal task forces?""Since Atchison’s death, Georgia’s NAACP has been pushing for new federal legislation or Justice Department policy that would prevent local police officers on federal task forces who are charged with local crimes from moving their cases to federal court.“That barrier allows them to escape accountability,” said Griggs, the organization’s president, who met with Ossoff last week. “We saw Jimmy’s case and other cases that were stonewalled for years.”",[]

The agency planned to work with state child protection services to return the boys to the U.S., according to the email, which a parent shared with NBC News.The children are being held in Jamaican group homes, according to attorneys working on their behalf.The Child Protection and Family Services Agency in Jamaica did not elaborate on the type of alleged abuse and said it cannot comment due to the ongoing investigation. It’s unclear how the allegations came to light.Atlantis Leadership Academy did not respond to requests for comment. In a letter to parents, Randall Cook, the program’s director, said: “With our reputation and transparency, no one could believe something like this could have occurred, nor that we are in any way an abusive organization.”Do you have a story with NBC News? Contact usTarah Fleischman, 59, whose special needs son, Cody, is among the boys pulled from the academy, said she’s frustrated by the long wait to bring her son home to Wisconsin and upset by the mistreatment she alleges her son faced there. Fleischman met with her son, Cody, after a March court hearing in Jamaica.Courtesy Tarah FleischmanCody, 16, who is diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder and ADHD, arrived at Atlantis last May and has lost a significant amount of weight since then, she said. Fleischman was not allowed to speak to Cody while he was at Atlantis, but she was able to see him for about an hour last week, and he told her that he had been beaten at the school, according to Fleischman and an advocate who was present. She regrets sending Cody to the school, which she said quickly agreed to enroll him last spring after several other programs rejected him. She had hoped placing Cody at Atlantis would help him learn to control his aggressive outbursts, and keep both her son and her family safe.“I’m just so frustrated with the system,” she said. “Unfortunately, I was a desperate mother who got preyed upon.”The situation has alarmed youth rights advocates who have previously raised concerns that many facilities that are part of the so-called troubled teen industry in the U.S. operate with limited oversight. That has allowed abuse to go unchecked for years in some schools before authorities intervene. State and local agencies have even less oversight when children are sent abroad. “This is as hidden as it gets,” said Chelsea Maldonado, a consultant with 11:11 Media Impact, the charitable arm of Paris Hilton’s media company, who has been arranging legal assistance for the children and met with Fleischman and Cody last week.Problems at programs for troubled youth Two programs in Wyoming were accused of forcing teens to do heavy farm work and using humiliating punishments.Utah officials ordered a for-profit academy to shut down after children died in its care.Former campers described harsh introductions to a North Carolina wilderness camp where a boy recently died.Atlantis Leadership Academy is a small, private facility for boys that lists no accreditation on its website. Cook, an American who previously worked as a consultant for troubled teen programs domestically, established the school in 2016, according to its Yelp page, and registered it as a business in Idaho. The program charged parents as much as $9,800 a month in tuition, records show, and said it would take in boys that others had rejected.The Child Protection and Family Services Agency removed the boys on Feb. 8. A week later, a judge in Jamaica denied the program’s request to return the boys and has ordered the school to turn over the students’ belongings, according to an email to parents from the U.S. Embassy. In a Feb. 27 letter to parents, Cook said that he was “working our back channels” and collecting signatures from locals to show that “we are a good program and need to remain in the community as is.”The State Department declined to comment. The U.S. Embassy in Kingston, Jamaica, also declined to comment on the case, but said it works with local authorities to ensure that the child welfare facilities where American children are held “remain as safe and comfortable as possible.”At the most recent court hearing, on March 15, the abuse allegations were not discussed, according to Fleischman and two attorneys who attended. The seven boys were present but were not called upon to speak, and the judge ordered another hearing to take place in April. Fleischman said she learned that her son and others had been taken from the facility when one of the boys called her on Feb. 14. In a recording of the call, which she shared with NBC News, one of the boys told her Cody was frequently beaten by the staff at Atlantis Leadership Academy and sometimes went days without food.“It just feels so surreal,” she said. “I still can’t believe that this happened.”Tarah Fleischman's son, Cody, in May, August and December 2023. She says her son has lost a significant amount of weight.Courtesy Tarah FleischmanShe had already been growing concerned about Cody. Her only contact with him was the photos that Atlantis staff sent her, which showed Cody outside during field trips and picking up trash on the beach. She was alarmed by how pale and thin he appeared. Fleischman called the U.S. Embassy, which she said told her its role would largely be as an observer as the Jamaican legal process played out and provided her with a list of Jamaican attorneys. Boys at the Atlantis Leadership Academy in Treasure Beach pick up trash.Courtesy Tarah FleischmanShe then sought help on forums for people who had been placed at abusive youth facilities. She got in touch with Maldonado, who became an advocate after her experience at Tranquility Bay, a troubled teen program in Jamaica that shut down in 2009 following abuse allegations. Maldonado connected Fleischman with attorneys who have handled child abuse cases and flew to Jamaica to assist. “These children were sent to a foreign country where they weren’t allowed to call or talk to anyone,” Maldonado said. “And somehow, because of one parent reaching out to the survivor community, we were able to discover it and find out what’s been going on down here and actually advocate for these children.”Fleischman said she was the only parent present at the March 15 hearing.

Three gruesome weeks later, she died in excruciating pain from the very drug meant to prolong her life.Rosen, a 70-year-old retired schoolteacher, passed her final days in anguish, enduring severe diarrhea and nausea and terrible sores in her mouth that kept her from eating, drinking, and, eventually, speaking. Skin peeled off her body. Her kidneys and liver failed. “Your body burns from the inside out,” said Rosen’s daughter, Lindsay Murray, of Andover, Massachusetts.Rosen was one of more than 275,000 cancer patients in the United States who are infused each year with fluorouracil, known as 5-FU, or, as in Rosen’s case, take a nearly identical drug in pill form called capecitabine. These common types of chemotherapy are no picnic for anyone, but for patients who are deficient in an enzyme that metabolizes the drugs, they can be torturous or deadly.Carol Rosen, left, and her daughter, Lindsay Murray, celebrate Thanksgiving in 2020. Rosen, a 70-year-old retired schoolteacher, passed her final days in anguish after three weeks of chemotherapy with incompatible drugs. Justin Murray / KFF Health NewsThose patients essentially overdose because the drugs stay in the body for hours rather than being quickly metabolized and excreted. The drugs kill an estimated 1 in 1,000 patients who take them — hundreds each year — and severely sicken or hospitalize 1 in 50. Doctors can test for the deficiency and get results within a week — and then either switch drugs or lower the dosage if patients have a genetic variant that carries risk.Yet a recent survey found that only 3% of U.S. oncologists routinely order the tests before dosing patients with 5-FU or capecitabine. That’s because the most widely followed U.S. cancer treatment guidelines — issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network — don’t recommend preemptive testing.The FDA added new warnings about the lethal risks of 5-FU to the drug’s label on March 21 following queries from KFF Health News about its policy. However, it did not require doctors to administer the test before prescribing the chemotherapy.The agency, whose plan to expand its oversight of laboratory testing was the subject of a House hearing, also March 21, has said it could not endorse the 5-FU toxicity tests because it’s never reviewed them.Carol Rosen and granddaughters Harleigh Murray, left, and Brooklyn Murray visit the Irish Cottage restaurant in Methuen, Mass. Rosen, a 70-year-old retired schoolteacher, passed her final days in anguish after three weeks of chemotherapy with incompatible drugs. Lindsay Murray / KFF Health NewsBut the FDA at present does not review most diagnostic tests, said Daniel Hertz, an associate professor at the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy. For years, with other doctors and pharmacists, he has petitioned the FDA to put a black box warning on the drug’s label urging prescribers to test for the deficiency.“FDA has responsibility to assure that drugs are used safely and effectively,” he said. The failure to warn, he said, “is an abdication of their responsibility.”The update is “a small step in the right direction, but not the sea change we need,” he said.Europe ahead on safetyBritish and European Union drug authorities have recommended the testing since 2020. A small but growing number of U.S. hospital systems, professional groups, and health advocates, including the American Cancer Society, also endorse routine testing. Most U.S. insurers, private and public, will cover the tests, which Medicare reimburses for $175, although tests may cost more depending on how many variants they screen for.In its latest guidelines on colon cancer, the Cancer Network panel noted that not everyone with a risky gene variant gets sick from the drug, and that lower dosing for patients carrying such a variant could rob them of a cure or remission. Many doctors on the panel, including the University of Colorado oncologist Dr. Wells Messersmith, have said they have never witnessed a 5-FU death.In European hospitals, the practice is to start patients with a half- or quarter-dose of 5-FU if tests show a patient is a poor metabolizer, then raise the dose if the patient responds well to the drug. Advocates for the approach say American oncology leaders are dragging their feet unnecessarily, and harming people in the process.“I think it’s the intransigence of people sitting on these panels, the mindset of ‘We are oncologists, drugs are our tools, we don’t want to go looking for reasons not to use our tools,’” said Gabriel Brooks, an oncologist and researcher at the Dartmouth Cancer Center.Oncologists are accustomed to chemotherapy’s toxicity and tend to have a “no pain, no gain” attitude, he said. 5-FU has been in use since the 1950s.Yet “anybody who’s had a patient die like this will want to test everyone,” said Dr. Robert Diasio of the Mayo Clinic, who helped carry out major studies of the genetic deficiency in 1988.Oncologists often deploy genetic tests to match tumors in cancer patients with the expensive drugs used to shrink them. But the same can’t always be said for gene tests aimed at improving safety, said Mark Fleury, policy director at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network.When a test can show whether a new drug is appropriate, “there are a lot more forces aligned to ensure that testing is done,” he said. “The same stakeholders and forces are not involved” with a generic like 5-FU, first approved in 1962, and costing roughly $17 for a month’s treatment.Oncology is not the only area in medicine in which scientific advances, many of them taxpayer-funded, lag in implementation. For instance, few cardiologists test patients before they go on Plavix, a brand name for the anti-blood-clotting agent clopidogrel, although it doesn’t prevent blood clots as it’s supposed to in a quarter of the 4 million Americans prescribed it each year. In 2021, the state of Hawaii won an $834 million judgment from drugmakers it accused of falsely advertising the drug as safe and effective for Native Hawaiians, more than half of whom lack the main enzyme to process clopidogrel.The fluoropyrimidine enzyme deficiency numbers are smaller — and people with the deficiency aren’t at severe risk if they use topical cream forms of the drug for skin cancers. Yet even a single miserable, medically caused death was meaningful to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where Carol Rosen was among more than 1,000 patients treated with fluoropyrimidine in 2021.Her daughter was grief-stricken and furious after Rosen’s death. “I wanted to sue the hospital. I wanted to sue the oncologist,” Murray said. “But I realized that wasn’t what my mom would want.”Instead, she wrote Dana-Farber’s chief quality officer, Dr. Joe Jacobson, urging routine testing. He responded the same day, and the hospital quickly adopted a testing system that now covers more than 90% of prospective fluoropyrimidine patients. About 50 patients with risky variants were detected in the first 10 months, Jacobson said.Dana-Farber uses a Mayo Clinic test that searches for eight potentially dangerous variants of the relevant gene. Veterans Affairs hospitals use a 11-variant test, while most others check for only four variants.Different tests may be needed for different ancestriesThe more variants a test screens for, the better the chance of finding rarer gene forms in ethnically diverse populations. For example, different variants are responsible for the worst deficiencies in people of African and European ancestry, respectively. There are tests that scan for hundreds of variants that might slow metabolism of the drug, but they take longer and cost more.These are bitter facts for Dr. Scott Kapoor, a Toronto-area emergency room physician whose brother, Dr. Anil Kapoor, died in February 2023 of 5-FU poisoning.Anil Kapoor was a well-known urologist and surgeon, an outgoing speaker, researcher, clinician, and irreverent friend whose funeral drew hundreds. His death at age 58, only weeks after he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, stunned and infuriated his family.In Ontario, where Kapoor was treated, the health system had just begun testing for four gene variants discovered in studies of mostly European populations. Anil Kapoor and his siblings, the Canadian-born children of Indian immigrants, carry a gene form that’s apparently associated with South Asian ancestry.Scott Kapoor supports broader testing for the defect — only about half of Toronto’s inhabitants are of European descent — and argues that an antidote to fluoropyrimidine poisoning, approved by the FDA in 2015, should be on hand. However, it works only for a few days after ingestion of the drug and definitive symptoms often take longer to emerge.Most importantly, he said, patients must be aware of the risk. “You tell them, ‘I am going to give you a drug with a 1 in 1,000 chance of killing you. You can take this test. Most patients would be, ‘I want to get that test and I’ll pay for it,’ or they’d just say, ‘Cut the dose in half.’”Dr. Alan Venook, the University of California-San Francisco oncologist who co-chairs the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, has led resistance to mandatory testing because the answers provided by the test, in his view, are often murky and could lead to undertreatment.“If one patient is not cured, then you giveth and you taketh away,” he said. “Maybe you took it away by not giving adequate treatment.”Instead of testing and potentially cutting a first dose of curative therapy, “I err on the latter, acknowledging they will get sick,” he said. About 25 years ago, one of his patients died of 5-FU toxicity and “I regret that dearly,” he said. “But unhelpful information may lead us in the wrong direction.”In September, seven months after his brother’s death, Kapoor was boarding a cruise ship on the Tyrrhenian Sea near Rome when he happened to meet a woman whose husband, Atlanta municipal judge Gary Markwell, had died the year before after taking a single 5-FU dose at age 77.“I was like ... that’s exactly what happened to my brother.”Murray senses momentum toward mandatory testing. In 2022, the Oregon Health & Science University paid $1 million to settle a suit after an overdose death.“What’s going to break that barrier is the lawsuits, and the big institutions like Dana-Farber who are implementing programs and seeing them succeed,” she said. “I think providers are going to feel kind of bullied into a corner. They’re going to continue to hear from families and they are going to have to do something about it.”",[]

Asked about the groups he was affiliated with, including Identity Evropa, once one of the largest U.S. white nationalist organizations, Blevins said those groups no longer exist. He also defended his actions. “If speaking out against what was being done to this country, what is continuing to be done to this country, is a crime, then I would gladly plead guilty to that,” he said. Answering a follow-up question, Blevins, a former Marine, said the purpose of his prior activism was “the same issues that got Donald Trump elected in 2016: securing America’s borders, reforming our legal immigration system and frankly, pushing back on this anti-white hatred that is so common in media and entertainment.”He said he has never identified as a white nationalist or a white supremacist.Blevins won his seat representing Ward 1 on Enid’s six-member City Council last year. His ties to white nationalist organizations — including his participation in the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in Virginia — had been publicly reported but became widely known in Enid only after his election, spurring a campaign to unseat him. Blevins’ challenger, Cheryl Patterson, directly addressed his white nationalist ties for the first time at Tuesday’s forum. “It’s time to restore our reputation,” said Patterson, a grandmother, former teacher and longtime Republican. Patterson outlined the threat she believes Blevins poses to the city’s military base and future growth. “I fear that his recent past puts our Air Force base at risk and jeopardizes our ability to recruit businesses to Enid,” she said. “There is no place for hate in Enid.”",[]

But he knew every person who had been assigned that morning to fix potholes on the bridge’s roadway, directly above where the ship hit. One by one, he called his colleagues, including some who had recently had babies. Each call went to voicemail.“I know everybody on that crew personally. They’re all great people,” Schneider said, declining to name them. “It’s tough.

While this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it,” Conde wrote. The decision to cut ties with McDaniel comes less than a week after NBC News announced her hiring, prompting an extraordinary public protest from the former host of its flagship Sunday morning political show, as well as from many of the most popular hosts of the network’s cable channel. Rachel Maddow opened her show on MSNBC on Monday night by urging NBC News to change its mind about hiring McDaniel.“I find the decision to put her on the payroll inexplicable, and I hope they will reconsider that decision,” Maddow said.MSNBC and NBC News are both part of the NBCUniversal News Group. McDaniel did not immediately respond to a voicemail and emails requesting comment.McDaniel’s hiring came two weeks after she left her post as head of the RNC, where she had voiced support for baseless claims by former President Donald Trump about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.Conde said in his memo that the decision to bring McDaniel on board was made “because of our deep commitment to presenting our audiences with a widely diverse set of viewpoints and experiences, particularly during these consequential times. We continue to be committed to the principle that we must have diverse viewpoints on our programs, and to that end, we will redouble our efforts to seek voices that represent different parts of the political spectrum.” The on-air journalists at NBC News and MSNBC argued that McDaniel lacked credibility after The Detroit News reported she joined Trump on a phone call as he reportedly pressured Republican canvassers in her home state of Michigan not to certify the 2020 presidential election results. In an interview Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” which host Kristen Welker said had been scheduled before it was announced that McDaniel was going to become a paid contributor, McDaniel addressed the phone call with the canvassers, saying, “​​I was not telling them to do anything.” “The pressure was being put on them from the hours and hours of threats and abuse they were receiving that coerced them to change their vote,” McDaniel said Sunday, adding that she told them, “I support you voting your conscience.”Following her appearance, NBC News chief political analyst Chuck Todd said on the broadcast that “she has credibility issues that she still has to deal with.” The criticism over her hiring continued Monday from early in the morning to late at night on MSNBC, with “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski saying that while NBC News should include conservative Republican voices to balance election coverage, it shouldn’t be someone “who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier.”Television networks frequently add politicians and political operatives to their rosters to serve as analysts and commentators: MSNBC host Jen Psaki is a former press secretary to President Joe Biden, and Michael Steele, who was chairman of the RNC from 2009 to 2011, is an MSNBC political analyst and co-host.But the hiring of McDaniel immediately prompted internal concern.Nicolle Wallace, a former White House communications director for President George W. Bush who is now a host on MSNBC, said on her show Monday that having McDaniel on the network would embolden “election deniers.” “NBC News, either wittingly or unwittingly, is teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,” she said.",[]

At the time, the city promised displaced families they would be able to return to the community and live ""in the newly redeveloped housing project.""That promise was never fulfilled.Public housing plans for the Chavez Ravine area were abandoned in 1958 in favor of building the baseball stadium.Previous efforts to block its construction led more than 650,000 registered voters in Los Angeles to participate in a 1957 plebiscite deciding the stadium’s fate, according to the Library of Congress.With 62.3% voter turnout, it became the largest non-presidential election in Los Angeles at the time, and voters ultimately sided with the Dodgers' plan to build their stadium.More Chavez Ravine residents were evicted in 1959 ""amid screaming, crying and cursing"" as bulldozers cleared the site where their homes used to stand, newspaper clippings from the time show.Families were evicted in May 1959 so construction of the new stadium could begin. Miller / USC Libraries / Corbis via Getty Images fileThe Dodgers debuted in their new stadium in April 1962.Aurora Vargas, Melissa Arechiga’s aunt, was among those evicted residents.Arechiga, alongside other descendants of the displaced Chavez Ravine families, founded the nonprofit group Buried Under the Blue, which seeks to raise awareness about this history.""Today marks the start of the journey to correct the injustices that were done to the people of Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop,"" Arechiga said at a news conference Friday. ""We must hold all city, state and federal agencies accountable for their part in the destruction of the three communities — plus stealing all the future generations from their wealth as owners and renters.""“The stories of the three communities can never be told without us,” added Arechiga, whose family's displacement was well-documented.Carrillo’s bill specifically proposes that the city of Los Angeles create a task force to compensate the displaced families or their descendants. The proposed forms of compensation include offers of city-owned land or fair-market-value compensation.Dodger Stadium rushed to completion for the opening of baseball season on April 10, 1962.AP fileThe measure, supported by state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, also calls for building a permanent memorial honoring affected families and creating a searchable database that details the history of the land acquisition.Carrillo said the database would be essential to verify which families were displaced.Her office also emphasized that the bill ""focuses solely on the displaced community of Chavez Ravine"" and does not request involvement from Dodger Stadium or the baseball team that plays there.Carrillo said the measure will be heard in the Assembly’s Judiciary Committee but did not specify when.After it moves through the Assembly, the bill must go before the state Senate before it lands on Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk.For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

""I was doing a play and I had to give birth onstage every night.""At the time, she said, she chose to share the news with her friends when they visited her backstage.“It was too much to keep it in when I was onstage pretending everything was fine. I had to keep it real otherwise. ... So when it did go well for me, having been on the other side of it — where you have to have the grace to be happy for someone — I wanted to let my sisters know, ‘You don’t have to always be graceful. I see you and I’ve been you.’”She said, “It’s really hard to want something so much and to wonder if you’re doing something wrong.""She said she was surprised to learn how many of her friends have gone through the same ordeal and how prevalent miscarriages are.“I thought, Where is this information? Why are we feeling so unnecessarily isolated? That’s where we take on damage. So I decided that I was going to talk about it,” she said.Ten percent to 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, according to the Mayo Clinic. But the actual statistic is higher because many miscarriages occur before people realize they are pregnant, the Mayo Clinic says on its website.Hathaway has two sons, ages 8 and 4, with her husband, producer Adam Shulman. A spokesperson for Hathaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.In the interview with Vanity Fair, Hathaway also discussed her upcoming project ""The Idea of You,"" which she produced and stars in alongside Nicholas Galitzine. She said she credits filmmaker Christopher Nolan with keeping the momentum in her career rolling when she had become a target of critics online after her Oscar campaign for “Les Misérables” in 2012.“A lot of people wouldn’t give me roles because they were so concerned about how toxic my identity had become online,” Hathaway said. “I had an angel in Christopher Nolan, who did not care about that and gave me one of the most beautiful roles I’ve had in one of the best films that I’ve been a part of.”Hathaway was referring to the part of NASA scientist Amelia Brand in Nolan’s “Interstellar” in 2014.",[]

She was one of the fortunate ones who survived Covid, and a year later, the medical staff who cared for her found themselves working under her leadership: In 2021, Arteaga Landaverde became Elmhurst's first female — and first Hispanic — chief executive officer.  The public hospital she now leads was founded in 1837 in the borough of Queens, a county of over 2 million people that's one of the most ethnically diverse in the country.  In the last few years, the history-making CEO has been focused on ensuring that Elmhurst gets the same kind of high-tech equipment that is available at private hospitals, with the goal of making it a top facility in the country. ""Two hundred thousand dollars,"" she said, pointing to a machine. ""It's a small machine, but it helps our patients so much."" ""I wanted to do something that would change the world — that our people know that one of them is running the largest hospital in Queens,"" Arteaga Landaverde said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo, ""that one of them also understands it's not easy to come to this country, that it's not easy to learn a new language."" Arteaga Landaverde is a longtime resident of Corona, Queens, having arrived with her family from Ecuador when she was young. Like many immigrant families, they came in search of a better life, and she said she saw how health care played a vital role in the community.“I wanted to study chemistry to find the cure of AIDS because I would see my neighbors, people I loved in my church were getting sick, they were dying, and there was a stigma that it was something bad,” she said. Helen Arteaga Landaverde.NYC Health + HospitalsArteaga Landaverde earned a scholarship to New York University, where she majored in chemistry, but her father’s leukemia diagnosis and subsequent death inspired her to channel that grief and change direction, earning a master’s in public health at Columbia University. Later, working with several community leaders, she opened the Plaza del Sol Family Health Center in Queens in 2014 in her father’s memory.Plaza Del Sol has provided care to more than 30,000 patients regardless of their ability to pay; “a place that everyone could go to,” she said.Having already served on the hospital’s board of directors, Arteaga Landaverde went through 21 interviews for the CEO spot and was selected from among 300 applicants. “When I arrived, people were scared, they wanted hope, they wanted solutions,” she said, adding that her priority is to show warmth and humanity to the hospital's patients. During the interview, she ran into her mother, who had come in for an appointment, in the hospital's corridor, both sharing a laugh about the chance encounter.Arteaga Landaverde's supporters say it was about time that someone from the community who understands its needs was picked to head the hospital.“One hundred and ninety years had to go by for a woman, a Latina, to finally be picked to be this center’s director,” said Vladimir Gasca, director of behavioral health and psychiatry at NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst.Currently working on a doctorate at CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, Arteaga Landaverde has received numerous awards and recognitions, including a fellowship with the National Hispana Leadership Institute.As the nation marks Women's History Month, she was asked her advice to girls and women who may think it's difficult to reach a goal, like she may have thought herself. “Keep in mind it’s hard, but dream as big as you possibly can,” Arteaga Landaverde said, spreading her arms wide open.An earlier story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

Quietly, they grieved for the dead and hoped that the living might still be plucked from the cold waters.They still don't know who may have died when parts of the bridge fell into the Patapsco River. They do know the bridge.Local residents gather to view a cargo ship that ran into and collapsed the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Tuesday.Win McNamee / Getty ImagesThey'd sailed their boats underneath it, driven over it or simply stood on the fort’s milelong walking path, with the 19th century cannons perched behind them, and taken photos of the soaring, 185-foot-high structure for no other reason than they thought it beautiful. Now it’s gone, and its neighbors are grieving.“It’s devastating,” said Kathy Carducci, 59, who was out walking with her 11-year-old beagle. “I have so many pictures of the bridge. Many times, we walk around and I’ll just take a picture of the bridge. It’s iconic Baltimore.”Sarah Vitale, 40, sat on a bench and gazed into the distance. She comes to the fort to walk from time to time, but Tuesday morning she was there to “reflect,” she said. At least six people were presumed dead Tuesday evening.“I saw the footage of it; it’s something out a horror movie,” she said. “I expected to feel this way when I came down here. I decided I wanted to do that not only to see what the scene looked like, but to pray for these people.”This being a world where terrorism is all too common, some of those who’d come to see the wreckage had wondered whether the bridge might have been attacked. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said at a morning news briefing that the ship operators had told authorities of a “power issue” and had issued a mayday call moments before the ship struck a pillar.“There are lots of conclusions we can all jump to,” said Richard Mead, 48, a Baltimore resident who was walking his dog, a boxer mix. “We have to worry about national security and infrastructure, but maybe today is a reminder that sometimes unfortunate things happen and there’s nothing we can do about it.”",[]

But the sentence cannot be imposed until both parties sign an agreement as to the details of the sentence.District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, and those gathered to rally for the victim, say this isn’t justice.“When we see our seniors being violently attacked and there be no actual consequences for it,” said Jenkins. “Yes, we are going to come together and we are going to stand together against what is happening.”Taylor survived the attack in front of her Post Street apartment in the city’s Tenderloin neighborhood.Friday’s rally, which also included two mayoral candidates — Mark Farrell and Daniel Laurie — as well as supervisor Matt Dorsey, became heated when counterprotesters showed up, saying the case was being politicized. The counterprotesters called themselves an ad hoc group of lawyers.The back and forth between the two groups got so intense, law enforcement had to step in to break it up.“And the fact that these people’s pain and suffering is being weaponized against judges who are doing such a hard job in such a hard climate is very inappropriate, and Brooke Jenkins should be ashamed of herself,” protestor Brian Ford said. The DA notes this case never went to trial, and the prosecutors were not involved in negotiating the sentence handed down by the judge.According to the district attorney’s office, this was a plea that was made in open court and that it objects to.In a lengthy phone conversation, Lisa Dewberry, the attorney for Cauich, applauded the judge for taking his mental state at the time of the attack into consideration.She also said she appreciated the sentence the judge imposed, especially the intensive supervision provision, which would provide treatment for mental health, substance abuse and ankle monitoring.“The court’s imposed sentence protects the public and it provides my client the necessary services he needs,"" Dewberry said.Cauich also pleaded guilty to a prior charge for burglary. It’s a crime he was waiting to be tried for when he attacked Taylor.The DA’s office has now filed a formal opposition to the judge’s sentence, and Friday’s hearing was postponed till April 12, followed by a meeting between lawyers on April 16.",[]

Travis County District Court Judge Amy Clark Meachum issued the temporary injunction Monday, writing that “immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or injury will result to PFLAG and its members” if the organization had to hand over information such as identities of members seeking gender-affirming care for minors, caregivers and patients to Paxton’s office.The new order allows the half-century-old nonprofit to keep its information private.“PFLAG families in Texas gained further protection today when the court reaffirmed that the Attorney General can’t two-step around the law with an outrageous demand for private information,” Brian K. Bond, CEO of PFLAG, said in a statement.The Texas Office of the Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Feb. 9, PFLAG received civil demands from Paxton's office to turn over documents, communications and information related to its work providing support for families with transgender children. Paxton's office said the demand for PFLAG documents was part of an effort to investigate medical providers offering gender-affirming care to minors despite Senate Bill 14, which banned treatment in the state.PFLAG filed a lawsuit on Feb. 28 that asked for a temporary restraining order and relief to protect its members’ privacy following the investigation demands.Paxton’s office responded to the lawsuit by saying it would hold the organization accountable.“PFLAG’s information is highly relevant to the Attorney General’s investigations into whether medical providers are committing insurance fraud in order to circumvent SB 14… PFLAG refused to produce a single document and instead sued the Attorney General in an apparent attempt to conceal information,” the Attorney General’s Office said in a statement on Feb. 29.Related stories:National LGBTQ group sues Texas after state AG demands records about trans youthsTexas AG says transition care for minors is child abuse under state lawWhen parents are the activists: PFLAG celebrates 50 years of LGBTQ advocacyOn March 1, a temporary restraining order was secured by PFLAG with the help of Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Transgender Law Center. That order remained in effect until the hearing on March 25, when Meachum issued the injunction on the same grounds.“This court ruling is a critical step in allowing PFLAG and its members to join together and advocate for each other, free from the threat of the attorney general’s retaliation and intimidation,” Chloe Kempf, attorney with the ACLU of Texas, said in a statement.Meachum wrote that there is “a substantial likelihood” that PFLAG will prevail after a trial, which is set to start June 10.The legal win for PFLAG is the latest development in the Texas effort to restrict access to transition-related care for minors. In September, the Texas Supreme Court allowed a new state law banning gender-affirming care for minors to take effect and, in December, Paxton asked a Seattle hospital to hand over records regarding gender-affirming treatment potentially given to children from Texas.For more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

Combs is a subject of a federal investigation, and several people have been interviewed by federal officials in Manhattan in relation to allegations involving sex trafficking, assault, illegal narcotics and firearms, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.Representatives for Combs, 54, did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment Monday.The producer, Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, filed his original lawsuit against Combs and others in February, alleging that Combs forced him to procure sex workers and pressured him to engage in unwelcomed sex acts with them.The amended suit alleges that Gooding groped Jones while on Combs’ yacht.An attorney and representatives for Gooding did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Monday.Gooding “began touching, groping, and fondling Mr. Jones’ legs, his upper inner thighs near his groin, the small of his back near his buttocks, and his shoulders,” Jones’ the suit states.Jones “was extremely uncomfortable and proceeded to lean away from Mr. Gooding Jr.,” the lawsuit says. “He rejected his advances and Mr. Gooding Jr. did not stop until Mr. Jones forcibly pushed him away.”Attorneys for Jones said in the lawsuit that the incident happened on a yacht rented by Combs in the U.S. Virgin Islands in January 2023. It accused Gooding of sexual assault and misconduct.Gooding has not been charged with any crime.In a different case, Gooding pleaded guilty in 2022 to a misdemeanor charge that he forcibly kissed a worker at a New York nightclub in 2018.He completed alcohol and behavior modification counseling, was then allowed to withdraw that plea and then pleaded guilty to a lesser harassment violation, resolving the case with no jail time.On Monday, federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations executed search warrants at properties belonging to Combs in Los Angeles and Miami, sources told NBC News.There has been no information connecting Gooding to any of the searches, and it is not clear what the searches entailed.Combs has been accused of misconduct in civil cases filed by four women. One was quickly settled and three are pending. Combs has denied the allegations in those lawsuits.“Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.

And I have heard defenders say it before, and I hear them, ‘Hey, you’re putting me in a really tough spot. You’re saying I can’t hit here. What do I do?’ And my response has always been, ‘Well, you can’t do that, and that’s just because the guy you’re hitting is defenseless and has no way to protect himself.’ So we’ve got to protect him and you’ve got to come up with other ways, and you know what, they do.”The league played a video during a news conference to show six specific plays in which the hip-drop tackle was used in games, with Bengals tight end Drew Sample, Cowboys running back Tony Pollard, Bengals receiver Tyler Boyd, Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith and Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill all being on the receiving end of the now-illegal hit.NFL teams will continue to receive videos showing illegal hits and ways to make tackles within the rules.""This is never practiced; nobody does this in practice,"" McKay said. ""They’re only going to see it in the game. We will tell them, ’Listen, this a penalty on the books. You can call it. You got to see all three elements of what’s going on here. You got to see him grab him. You got to see him control them. You got to see him swivel himself up in the air and you got to see him go unweighted. You don’t see it, don’t call it.“We’re going to take all these tapes that you’ve seen. ... we’re going to take them all to the clubs and show them: this is what we don’t want. This is what a foul looks like.”A significant change to kickoffs wasn’t presented for a vote but McKay said it’s possible owners will consider it on Tuesday instead of waiting for the league meetings in May.All rules proposals require 24 out of 32 votes for approval.Only two other proposals were approved by owners.Teams will now receive a third challenge following one successful challenge. Previously, teams had to be successful on two challenges to receive a third.Also, if there is a double foul during a down in which there is a change or changes of possession, including if one of the fouls is a post-possession foul by a team during a scrimmage kick, the team last gaining possession will keep the ball after enforcement for its foul, provided it did not foul prior to last gaining possession.McKay said there’s urgency to vote on the complicated new kickoff rule this week because it could impact the way teams select players next month in the NFL draft.The new rule proposal takes elements of the kickoff rules used in spring leagues such as the XFL.For a standard kickoff, the ball would be kicked from the 35-yard line with the 10 kick coverage players lined up at the opposing 40, with five on each side of the field.The return team would have at least nine blockers lined up in the “set up zone” between the 30- and 35-yard line with at least seven of those players touching the 35. There would be up two returners allowed inside the 20.Only the kicker and two returners would be allowed to move until the ball hits the ground or was touched by a returner inside the 20.Any kick that reaches the end zone in the air can be returned, or the receiving team can opt for a touchback and possession at the 30. Any kick that reaches the end zone in the air and goes out of bounds or out of the end zone also would result in a touchback at the 30.If a ball hits a returner or the ground before the end zone and goes into the end zone, a touchback would be at the 20 or the play could be returned. Any kick received in the field of play would have be returned.Under current rules, any touchback — or if a returner calls for a fair catch in the field of play — results in the receiving team getting the ball at its 25.“This is our chance to keep special teams in the game,” McKay said. “Special teams has been a part of the game forever. And, if you lose the kickoff, in our mind, you really pretty much eliminated special teams and put it on a punt play. And so that’s what we’re trying to, get through and and figure out if we can get to 24 votes.”",[]

Stan Deal, the CEO and president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, has retired effective immediately. Larry Kellner, chair of the company's board of directors, will not stand for re-election at the next shareholders' annual meeting. Boeing board member and former Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf will succeed Kellner.The company has been mired in a slew of negative stories since a door panel blew out on a Boeing 737 Max plane flown by Alaska Airlines in January. The fallout from that fateful flight shows no sign of stopping: The FBI informed passengers last week that they may have been the victims of a crime that the bureau is still investigating. Despite Boeing announcing a range of measures to improve safety and committing to working with federal investigators, some passengers have spoken of feeling nervous climbing on board its aircraft.Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on Jan. 25.Aaron Schwartz / NurPhoto via Getty Images fileIn a letter to staff, posted on the Boeing website, Calhoun acknowledged that the Alaska Airlines incident had changed the company.""As you all know, the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident was a watershed moment for Boeing,"" he wrote. ""We must continue to respond to this accident with humility and complete transparency. We also must inculcate a total commitment to safety and quality at every level of our company.""""The eyes of the world are on us,"" he said, referring to ongoing efforts to reassure both the company's airline customers and the flying public that its aircraft are safe. In an interview with CNBC following Monday's announcement, Calhoun acknowledged the ongoing challenges at Boeing.  ""We have this bad habit in our company,"" he said, adding production pressures continued to weigh on performance. ""When you move it down the line, it sends a message to your own people that 'Wow, I guess the movement of the airplane is more important than the first time quality of the product.' And we have got to get that in way more balanced. Without a doubt."" Calhoun said in the letter to employees that the company had over the last five years faced “some of the most significant challenges our company and industry have ever faced in our 108-year history.” Calhoun was appointed CEO in 2020 in the wake of two other air disasters that some experts blamed on failures at Boeing. The crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines in 2018 and 2019, which killed a total of 346 people, both involved the failure of a Boeing software system known as MCAS. In an interview with the New York Times upon his appointment, Calhoun, who had served on the board of Boeing since 2009 and was appointed non-executive chairman in 2019, promised to change the internal culture at Boeing.“It’s more than I imagined it would be, honestly,” Calhoun said at the time, describing the problems he was confronting at the plane manufacturer. “And it speaks to the weaknesses of our leadership.”Yet in the same interview, he seemed to imply that American pilots would not have reacted to the MCAS system failures as the foreign-born ones did.In the wake of the second crash in March 2019, the 737 Max was grounded worldwide and not re-approved for flight for nearly two years.  In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.5 billion penalty to settle criminal charges over accusations it concealed information about its 737 Max airplane, with Boeing admitting it had ""deceived"" the FAA about the MCAS system's reliability.Calhoun said at the time that the settlement ""appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations.""In an interview last week, Michael Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, told NBC News that Boeing had no choice but to develop a plan to improve its culture and practices to meet the agency's safety standards.Whitaker said Boeing’s priorities “have been on production and not on safety and quality.” In a written statement in response to the leadership changes, Alaska Airlines said it has flown Boeing planes for nearly 60 years and is committed to the company.""We share more than a hometown with Boeing; we share a passion for flying and a commitment to safety. We know the people behind the planes, who have dedicated their careers over these decades to make air travel better and safer,"" the statement said, adding ""we will do everything we can to contribute to the critical work under way to ensure excellence in production quality and safety."" In the wake of the January Alaska Airlines incident, some Wall Street analysts said more drastic change was needed. “How many times can ‘won’t happen again’ happen again?” Bank of America Corp. analyst Ronald Epstein wrote in a report in January. “Both Boeing and [Boeing parts supplier] Spirit [AeroSystems] need a drastic cultural overhaul. This cultural change won’t come from FAA mandates, congressional hearings, internal memos, or one-hour all hands meetings. For culture to move from corporate jargon to being embodied in the habits and minds of both workforces, we see it as necessary for Boeing and Spirit to drastically rethink the ways they have operated.”",[]

The Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani and interpreter Ippei Mizuhara during a news conference at Dodger Stadium on Dec. 14, 2023, in Los Angeles.Ashley Landis / AP fileThe allegations against Mizuhara centered specifically on wire transfers from Ohtani’s account — totaling at least $4.5 million, made in at least nine payments of $500,000 — to a bookmaking operation in Southern California that is currently under federal investigation and that was allegedly run by Matthew Bowyer of Orange County, California, a person familiar with Ohtani and Mizuhara’s interactions told NBC News.The person familiar with their interactions said that at first Mizuhara told Ohtani's representatives that he had been gambling and racked up a large amount of debt, prompting him to ask Ohtani to bail him out.Ohtani said this version of events — that he was ever asked to bail out the interpreter — was untrue. ""Up until a couple days ago, I didn’t know that this was happening,"" Ohtani said.Ohtani said Mizuhara ultimately admitted to him he sent money from his account to a bookmaker.Mizuhara did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday and has not answered past NBC News requests. Mizuhara reportedly said at the time that Ohtani was upset and angry with him because the two-way star hates betting, but that he ultimately agreed to pay the debts as long as Mizuhara never gambled again, according to the person familiar.As media inquiries rolled in, Mizuhara changed his story, the person said, and admitted to Ohtani’s agent and representatives that the original story was a lie.Instead, Mizuhara said Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling or his debts. Mizuhara allegedly stole the massive sum from Ohtani, according to the source, authorizing the wire transfers from Ohtani’s account to the associate in the bookmaking operation over a period of time last year without Ohtani’s participation or knowledge.Shohei Ohtani in the dugout during the MLB Spring Training game between the Los Angeles Angels and Dodgers on Sunday at Dodger Stadium.Brian Rothmuller / Icon Sportswire via Getty ImagesOhtani said Monday that he first learned of the situation during a team meeting in South Korea last week as the Dodgers opened the MLB season with a two-game series. He said he was unaware Mizuhara had a gambling addiction and was in debt. “I never agreed to pay off the debt or make payments to the bookmaker,” Ohtani said at the news conference.His recounting of events Monday paralleled reports that Mizuhara was fired after reporters had questions about his name coming up in a federal investigation of illegal gambling.Major League Baseball has opened its own investigation of the matter. The Internal Revenue Service has confirmed that Mizuhara and Bowyer are under criminal investigation.Bowyer’s attorney, Diane Bass, said Bowyer’s home was searched by the IRS, Homeland Security, and FBI agents in October as part of an investigation. No charges have been filed, she said, and his team was discussing a possible plea agreement with federal authorities.Bass said, “Bowyer has never had any contact with Shohei Ohtani. He has never met him he has never spoken with him.”The attorney said Bowyer first noticed Ohtani's funds were possibly involved when a wire transfer with his name on it was remitted. A subject line stated, ""loan,"" she said.Still, Bass noted, it was quite possible Ohtani was unaware. ""That's the big question,"" she said.She described Mizuhara as a bookmaking client of Bowyer’s for a two-year period that ended in 2024. “It was Matthew Bowyer’s understanding Mizuhara was his client, no one else,” Bass said.She added, ""Mr. Mizuhara was placing bets mostly on international soccer and occasionally basketball and football, but never baseball.""MLB prohibits players and employees from placing bets on baseball and from wagering with illegal or offshore bookmakers. Consequences are largely left to team management. Ohtani said Monday his statements were limited by legal considerations, but he expressed that it was difficult for him to put his emotions into words.

Schools will be required to institute the inclusive curricula by the 2025-26 school year.“The governor was happy to sign legislation that aims to ensure students of all races and identities feel safe and welcome at school,” Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for Inslee, said in an email Monday.Faulk also referred NBC News to research published in the journal Sex Education that suggests LGBTQ-inclusive curricula can reduce rates of bullying and make children feel safer in school. Kristie Bennett is a high school teacher in Sammamish, Washington, who is bisexual and leads her school’s gender-sexuality alliance organization. In an interview last week with NBC affiliate KGW of Portland, Oregon, Bennett echoed Faulk’s sentiment. “I’ve seen firsthand how important an inclusive curriculum can be and how life-changing it can be to help a student see themselves in the curriculum instead of some old dead white guys from the 1700s,” Bennett said.Washington is the seventh state to enact legislation mandating that public schools incorporate LGBTQ-inclusive curricula in some capacity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. The other six are: California, New Jersey, Colorado, Oregon, Nevada and Illinois, states that have been won by Democrats in the last four presidential elections.The law also comes as conservative lawmakers introduce record numbers of anti-LGBTQ measures, including legislation to regulate how LGBTQ issues are taught in public schools. Over the last several years, Republican officials have sought to limit how sexual orientation and gender identity are taught in school through measures critics have dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” laws; bans on books with queer storylines or characters; and disbandments of diversity, equity and inclusion programs at public universities.Seven states — all but one of them led by Republicans — have laws in place that restrict the instruction of sexual orientation or gender identity in some public schools, according to MAP.Gabriele Magni, an assistant professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles and director of the school’s LGBTQ+ Politics Research Initiative, called the enactment of the measures to mandate LGBTQ history be taught at public schools a “reaction” to anti-LGBTQ measures introduced in red states.“It’s similar to the analogy we’ve seen with abortion. On the one hand, you’ve seen states banning abortion or making it much more unrealistic,” Magni said. “And then, on the other hand, you’ve seen states like California or New York ramping up their protections and also offering a more welcoming environment for people who may come from out of state.”LGBTQ advocates in Washington similarly suggested that their state’s new law was necessary to counter the idea from conservatives that queer identities are inappropriate for children. “It’s considered too controversial to mention to kids that Thoreau was gay or Walt Whitman was gay,” Ken Shulman, the executive director of Seattle-based LGBTQ advocacy group Lambert House, told KGW. “Alan Turing — who invented the first computer, helped serve the Enigma code and win World War II — was gay.”",[]

Wade, the court on Tuesday will revisit the issue of reproductive rights, this time contemplating whether to limit access to mifepristone, the first of two pills used in medication abortion.Ahead of oral arguments and eventual ruling, doctors and patient advocates are expressing alarm about what might happen if the high court decides to tighten access to the drug. Following the Dobbs ruling in 2022, 14 states now completely ban abortion, including medication abortion. A handful of other states ban delivering the drugs by mail and require patients to see a doctor in person before they can get a prescription for mifepristone. Medication abortions accounted for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the United States in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion.At issue Tuesday is whether the Food and Drug Administration disregarded important safety concerns when it expanded access to mifepristone beginning in 2016. Those eventual expansion include making it available from mail-order pharmacies.Two studies cited in a Texas court ruling last year claimed mifepristone could be harmful. Those studies, however, were later retracted after the publication found “fundamental problems with the study design and methodology” as well as conflicts of interest.“I’m very concerned,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN in New Jersey and the former board chair for Physicians of Reproductive Health, an advocacy group for reproductive rights. “While there are alternatives that people could get if mifepristone is no longer available, it still means that most people seeking abortion are going to be impacted.”It could set “an incredibly dangerous precedent,” said Kristen Moore, the director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. Putting the medication back “under lock and key” means “breaking the system,” she added.The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 to end pregnancies of up to seven weeks. Over the last decade, the FDA made revisions to the approval that made the drug easier to get, including allowing it to be prescribed without an in-person doctor visit and expanding the number of eligible pharmacies — such as drug store chains, including CVS and Walgreens — that can dispense the drug. It also extended the time mifepristone can be used up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.The Supreme Court could roll back those changes, including in states where abortion is still legal. It’s unclear when the court could make a final ruling, but experts expect a decision by the end of June.“It is a uniquely important case,” said Arthur Caplan, the head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. “If the court were to buy into it, it would clearly bring abortion by pill to end around this country.”Three members of the Women's March group protest in support of access to abortion medication outside the Federal Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, on March 15, 2023.David Erickson / AP fileLimiting access to the only choice The FDA has maintained that medication abortion is safe and effective.Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in the regimen for use in early abortions. A second drug, misoprostol, is taken one to two days later. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs to support a pregnancy. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract and empty. As a two-drug regimen, the medications successfully end a pregnancy nearly 100% of the time, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.Dr. Michael Belmonte, a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said medication abortion is safe and the option that many of his patients prefer.“I always include medication abortion as an option when counseling my patients,” he said. Limiting access, he added, could “make it harder for patients for whom medication is the right, or in some cases, the only choice for them.”Clinics stocking upBrandi said she is particularly concerned about people with disabilities or others who lack the resources to be able to travel to get a surgical abortion. Women who are in the country illegally, she added, may also face difficulties crossing state lines to access abortions. The medication is also used to help women recover after a miscarriage.“It’s going to vastly impact people that are marginalized,” she said. “Medication abortion has been a huge access point for people who need it.”Providers are preparing for the worst-case scenario.Moore, of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project, said doctors are already stocking up on the medication in their clinics in case they need to act as both the doctor and the dispenser.Still, “it could put an intense amount of pressure on an already pressurized abortion care ecosystem,” she said.Even ahead of Tuesday’s ruling, some patients are already under the impression that medication abortion is banned nationwide, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, an abortion provider with clinics in four states.That is concerning, she added, because it leaves people confused about whether they can access care.“My experience with patients oftentimes is that they will hear something like a bill being introduced and they think that it’s already law,” Miller said. “That strategy of having people confused about their rights, afraid of what’s legal, what’s not legal, where can I access something I think is part of what’s at play here.”Audrey Wrobel, 27, of Philadelphia and a patient advocate for Planned Parenthood, said medication abortion was the best option for her when she decided to end her pregnancy in 2015.In college at the time, Wrobel found out that she was pregnant after taking a pregnancy test in the bathroom of a grocery store. After telling her boyfriend, they drove to a Planned Parenthood about 20 minutes away to take a second pregnancy test. About two weeks later, she was prescribed mifepristone. The medication abortion, Wrobel said, meant she could have privacy and “the care I needed on my own terms.”She said the Supreme Court shouldn’t be able to decide what women should do with their bodies.“We are the ones living with the decisions,” she said.",[]

But it said that much of the information was already in the public domain.In Washington, the Treasury Department said it sanctioned Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company Ltd., which it calls a Chinese Ministry of State Security front company that has “served as cover for multiple malicious cyberoperations.”It named two Chinese nationals, Zhao Guangzong and Ni Gaobin, affiliated with the Wuhan company, for cyberoperations that targeted U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, “directly endangering U.S. national security.”Zhao, Ni and five other Chinese nationals were hit with federal charges Monday. An indictment brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn alleges that the seven men were Chinese intelligence officers who engaged in a yearslong campaign targeting top White House officials, U.S. senators and the spouses of high-ranking members of the Justice Department, among others. The suspects are accused of sending tracking emails purported to be from prominent U.S. journalists, which contained legitimate news articles from publications like CNN and VOX. The emails also contained embedded hyperlinks that, when opened, would transmit information about the recipients to a server controlled by the suspects, the indictment says.One of the group’s alleged campaigns took place from June to September 2018 when they sent more than 10,000 messages to a wide range of targets including Democratic and Republican senators from more than 10 states and the spouses of various government administrators including a high-ranking Department of Justice official, high-ranking White House officials and multiple United States senators.""These allegations pull back the curtain on China’s vast illegal hacking operation that targeted sensitive data from U.S. elected and government officials, journalists and academics; valuable information from American companies; and political dissidents in America and abroad,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement.Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said her government ""firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyberattacks in accordance with law."" ""Without valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,"" Liu added. ""It is extremely irresponsible and is a complete distortion of facts.""Separately, British cybersecurity officials said that Chinese government-affiliated hackers “conducted reconnaissance activity” against British parliamentarians who are critical of Beijing in 2021. They said no parliamentary accounts were successfully compromised.Three lawmakers, including former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, told reporters Monday they have been “subjected to harassment, impersonation and attempted hacking from China for some time.” Duncan Smith said in one example, hackers impersonating him used fake email addresses to write to his contacts.The politicians are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international pressure group focused on countering Beijing’s growing influence and calling out alleged rights abuses by the Chinese government.Ahead of that announcement, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reiterated that China is “behaving in an increasingly assertive way abroad” and is “the greatest state-based threat to our economic security.”“It’s right that we take measures to protect ourselves, which is what we are doing,” he said, without providing details.China critics including Duncan Smith have long called for Sunak to take a tougher stance on China and label the country a threat — rather than a “challenge” — to the U.K., but the government has refrained from using such critical language.Responding to the reports, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said countries should base their claims on evidence rather than “smear” others without factual basis.“Cybersecurity issues should not be politicized,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. “We hope all parties will stop spreading false information, take a responsible attitude, and work together to maintain peace and security in cyberspace.”",[]

Maddie McGarvey for NBC NewsWhen LifeWise launched in 2018, the initial goal was to serve 25 schools by 2025, but it surpassed that long ago. By the start of this year, LifeWise had set up chapters in more than 300 schools in a dozen states, teaching 35,000 public school students weekly Bible lessons that are usually scheduled to coincide with lunch or noncore courses such as library, art or gym class.LifeWise has won support from conservatives on the front lines of the new culture wars over LGBTQ inclusion, sexually explicit library books and the role of racism in American history. But it also has a growing foothold in some progressive suburbs and cities, including deep-blue Columbus, Ohio. Its explosive growth has been celebrated by Christian groups and parents who’ve long decried the removal of religion from America’s classrooms — and denounced by those who believe there should be a hard line between religion and public education.Supporters say LifeWise, which teaches children character development through Bible lessons, complies with the separation of church and state. Public schools are not allowed to directly promote or fund the program, which is offered free to students whose parents sign permission slips.“A lot of parents want to be able to say to their child, ‘Yeah, you’re going to get science class, you’re going to get math class, you’re going to get English class — and you’re going to have Bible class, too, because this is important to us as a family,’” said LifeWise founder and former Ohio State Buckeyes defensive lineman Joel Penton.LifeWise founder Joel Penton is on a mission to teach America's public school children about Jesus.Maddie McGarvey for NBC NewsBut parents and activists who’ve mobilized against LifeWise say that busing students to nearby churches, where they sometimes collect prizes and eat candy, has made some non-Christian children feel left out or pressured to attend.“Whether it’s happening on campus or not, this program is bringing religion into the school,” said Demrie Alonzo, an English tutor who works at several schools with LifeWise programs in central Ohio. “It’s not fair to the kids of different religions.”At a time when conservatives nationally are fighting what they portray as liberal indoctrination in schools, some parents and critics see the opposite playing out, accusing LifeWise of using schools to draw children into an evangelical faith tradition whose members overwhelmingly vote Republican.Opponents have also documented several instances of teachers and administrators promoting LifeWise to students, either by allowing LifeWise volunteers to visit classrooms, hosting schoolwide assemblies or advertising the program in paperwork sent home to parents — actions that, according to some legal experts, could violate the First Amendment.Penton said LifeWise follows all laws and local policies and avoids hot-button partisan topics in its curriculum, which is designed to guide students through the entire Bible in five years. He said LifeWise receives “very broad support” from groups with a range of political views. Last summer, LifeWise’s national teacher summit was sponsored by Patriot Mobile, a far-right Christian cellphone company that has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting school board candidates promising to fight LGBTQ acceptance in schools.And in December, Penton appeared on the Truth and Liberty Live Call-in Show hosted by a group whose mission is to reshape American society by advancing conservative Christian values in seven key “mountains” of public life — including media, government and education.On the show, Penton lamented the referendum last year enshrining abortion rights in Ohio’s constitution, saying it made him “incredibly sad.” It also made him realize, he said, that LifeWise’s mission “is all the more important.”“What other hope do we have,” Penton said, “but to inject the word of God into the hearts of the next generation?”",[]

But now they say they are being forced to relive the trauma.Maureen Sartain, the babysitter Sinclair has accused of abusing him, has filed a lawsuit against Sinclair’s mother, saying in court documents that Marie Sinclair intentionally caused her emotional distress by telling others about the alleged abuse. The case is scheduled to go to trial next month in New York.“It keeps me up at night,” Marie Sinclair said of the thought of her son being called to testify in the trial. “Because of this ridiculous lawsuit, he’s being forced to confront some painful memories. It is so unfair.”Sartain declined a request for an interview through her attorney, Scott Mishkin, who referred NBC News to her deposition from last year. In it, Sartain denied abusing Joseph Sinclair. She is not suing for defamation and some legal experts have expressed surprise that the case is scheduled to go to trial.“What she’s trying to do is get around the truth test by reframing the case,” said Richard Epstein, a professor at New York University School of Law. “It’s an effort to repackage a defamation case as an emotional distress case to avoid the truth test.”Unlike in a suit for emotional distress, the plaintiff in a defamation case has to prove that the statement in question was false.Sartain’s attorney did not return a request for comment about the nature of the suit.The Sinclair family avoided Sartain for years after they learned of the alleged abuse, Marie Sinclair said.“Me and my husband, Jimmy, wanted to kill her,” she said of the babysitter, who lived on the same Smithtown street as the couple until they moved last year. But a therapist told them it wouldn’t be good for Joseph Sinclair’s therapy if they confronted her. “He needed to heal. He needed to get over the guilt and the shame of it, and confronting her would only harm him,” Marie Sinclair said the therapist told them.She followed that advice for three years. Then, on Nov. 2, 2020, she changed course.“I see you are friends with Maureen Grennan Sartain on Facebook,” she wrote in direct messages sent to at least a dozen people on the social network, according to the lawsuit, a transcript of her deposition and screenshots of messages Sinclair provided to NBC News. “I want you to know she is a pedophile and raped my child when he was 8 years old. She has never been prosecuted for this crime. If anything I can warn you, your family and your children.”Marie SinclairShe also sent the message to Sartain, adding: “I sent this to your friends. I hope someday you pay for your sick crimes.”The messages, which were sent to Sartain’s friends and family and to the parents of children she may have cared for, are at the center of a lawsuit Sartain filed against Sinclair alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress.Sartain’s attorney says in the lawsuit that she was “devastated to see that she was being accused of such conduct and was even more mortified over the fact that this false allegation was being sent to her friends and family.”The suit accuses Sinclair of having launched a “deliberate and malicious campaign of harassment” that was “intentional, reckless, extreme and outrageous.”But for the Sinclairs, who believe Sartain to be an abuser, the pending jury trial has landed like a punch, adding insult to injuries they had worked to heal.Joseph Sinclair, 28, was between the ages of 8 and about 13 when the alleged abuse occurred, he said in an interview with NBC News.“It has affected every relationship I’ve had, in terms of trust, interpersonal communication,” he said. “I was manipulated, and it makes me feel terrible about myself. That I allowed it, or that I didn’t say anything.”Not long after they learned about the alleged abuse, the Sinclairs also sought advice from the Suffolk County district attorney’s office in July 2017. In a copy of an email sent to the office that was shared with NBC News, they asked whether Sartain could be prosecuted and what the process would involve.“How can we prevent her from abusing other children in her care,” the email concluded.The Sinclairs said they never received a response. Marie Sinclair said she had also called the district attorney’s office with the same inquiry and was told that Joseph Sinclair could press charges but that it would be very difficult to win a criminal case against Sartain because the Sinclairs did not have footage or any other physical evidence of the alleged abuse.A spokesperson for the district attorney’s office said in a statement: “We cannot comment on matters from the prior administration as those in leadership from that time period are no longer employed here.” The spokesperson said the office is willing to speak with the Sinclairs and provided a name and phone number for an investigator. The spokesperson declined to comment further, saying, “sexual assault victims cannot be outed without their consent.”Joseph Sinclair said he never pursued criminal or civil action against Sartain because his focus has been on trying to heal.“During my years of therapy, eventually, one of our goals was to come to that decision — whether or not I wanted to,” he said.But now he plans to testify on his mother’s behalf, he said. Jury selection is scheduled to begin April 22 on Long Island.“I want her to be held accountable,” he said of Sartain. “And I want her to be seen as the terrible person she is.”In a deposition taken last year, Sartain testified that she babysat for a handful of other families from approximately 1990 to 2002. After Marie Sinclair told people about the alleged abuse, Sartain testified that she started having panic attacks every couple of days, would sometimes have trouble sleeping, had worsening jaw pain, and felt stressed.“I don’t like going out,” she said, according to a transcript of the deposition. “I feel like neighbors have shunned me. People on Facebook have unfriended me.”At Marie Sinclair’s deposition, Sartain’s attorney repeatedly asked Sinclair what her intention was in sending the messages and whether she cared at all about how they would affect Sartain. Sinclair responded that she wanted to warn people about who she believed Sartain to be and was concerned for any other potential victims.“If she was upset by it, that’s on her,” Sinclair responded, according to a transcript of the deposition. “I was worried about the families that I was sending it to.”About two weeks after she sent the messages, Sinclair received a cease-and-desist letter from Sartain’s attorney demanding, among other things, that she “immediately publish an apology for her false statements.” The lawsuit was filed three months later, in February 2021.It is not uncommon, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement, for people who come forward to allege sexual assault and harassment to be sued for defamation by their alleged perpetrators. But Sartain’s case differs from many of those in that, while she denies the allegations, she is not suing for defamation nor is she suing the person whom she is alleged to have abused.Benjamin Zipursky, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, described this approach as a “backdoor maneuver.”“Sometimes, people try to take a kind of alternative lawsuit for a variety of reasons,” Zipursky said. “One of the most common reasons is they believe defamation law has been crafted by the courts, including the Supreme Court over the last many decades, to be very protective of speakers and to make it very hard for plaintiffs who have been defamed to prevail.”Some attorneys who believe there may be too many defenses available to defendants for their client to win may shift to another category, Zipursky said, adding that one of the most common would be intentional infliction of emotional distress.Zipursky, who specializes in tort law and defamation law, said the jury will have to decide whether Marie Sinclair’s conduct was extreme and outrageous.“If this is what her boy told her had happened to him, then I don’t think that they’re going to think it was outrageous for her to say so,” he said.CORRECTION (March 25, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the circumstances of Joseph Sinclair’s conversation with his parents in 2016.

Paul Tonko, D-N.Y, who this month introduced the SAFE Bet Act to deal with what he has called a “public health crisis.”Both Tonko and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced their bills before the news broke that Ippei Mizuhara had allegedly stole $4.5 million from Ohtani to pay off bookies in Southern California who were being investigated by the U.S. government. “The widespread legalization and promotion of sports gambling will only make this type of incident more common moving forward,” Tonko said in an emailed response to a question from NBC News. “We have an obligation to address the predatory practices of this industry and protect consumers, which precisely what my SAFE Bet Act aims to do.”The act would require states to meet certain rules related to sports betting, including on advertising, money deposits and the use of artificial intelligence.The American Gaming Association, which advocates on behalf of the industry, said that the Ohtani case involved illegal gambling and that should be the focus of lawmakers.“It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that the pervasive illegal market persists and continues to prey on Americans,” AGA spokesperson Cait DeBaun said in a statement. “This only reinforces the need for federal action on illegal gambling operations that target vulnerable Americans, steal tax dollars from communities, and undermine the regulated marketplace. We commend Congress for calling on the Department of Justice to investigate and enforce the law.""The Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani at a preseason game in Los Angeles, on March 24.Harry How / Getty ImagesThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara, Ohtani's interpreter and close friend, on Thursday after Ohtani’s attorneys alleged that he had ""been the victim of a massive theft.""On Friday, Major League Baseball announced it had opened an investigation into Mizuhara and his alleged ties to illegal gambling. Specifically, NBC News reported that the allegations against Mizuhara center on wire transfers from Ohtani’s account — totaling at least $4.5 million — to a bookmaking operation in Southern California that is currently under federal investigation.While the Ohtani situation deals with illegal gambling, it comes amid growing scrutiny about the rise of legalized sports gambling in the U.S. The immediate availability of sports betting through mobile apps and the nearly omnipresent advertising for those apps has led to concern about whether the industry needs to be more closely regulated.That concern includes some players and coaches who have recently begun to speak out about gambling. Cleveland Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff recently said that sports gambling ""has gone too far"" and that he'd received threats from gamblers. Tyrese Haliburton, one of the NBA's rising stars, said that he feels like a ""prop"" for gamblers and that his social media is inundated with gambling talk.",[]

Then there’s totality’s densely populated corridor stretching from Mexico to the U.S. to Canada.Hundreds if not thousands of the tens of millions of spectators will double as “citizen scientists,” helping NASA and other research groups better understand our planet and star.They’ll photograph the sun’s outer crownlike atmosphere, or corona, as the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blotting out sunlight for up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds on April 8. They’ll observe the quieting of birds and other animals as midday darkness falls. They’ll also measure dropping temperatures, monitor clouds and use ham radios to gauge communication disruptions.At the same time, rockets will blast off with science instruments into the electrically charged portion of the atmosphere near the edge of space known as the ionosphere. The small rockets will soar from Wallops Island, Virginia — some 400 miles outside totality but with 81% of the sun obscured in a partial eclipse. Similar launches were conducted from New Mexico during last October’s “ring of fire” solar eclipse that swept across the western U.S. and Central and South America.“Time for the biggie! It is pretty exciting!!!” Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Aroh Barjatya, the rockets’ mission director, said in an email.NASA’s high-altitude jets also will take to the air again, chasing the moon’s shadow with improved telescopes to study the sun’s corona and surrounding dust.“Dust sounds boring,” acknowledged NASA’s eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck. “But at the same time, dust is actually really interesting. Those are the leftover remnants from when the solar system was forming.”More than 600 weather balloons will be launched by college students along the track, providing livestreams while studying atmospheric changes. Cloudy skies shouldn’t matter.“Lucky for us, the balloons flying to 80,000 feet and above don’t care if it’s cloudy on the ground,” said Angela Des Jardins, an astrophysicist at Montana State University who’s coordinating the nationwide project.And if the Federal Aviation Administration approves, a 21-foot (6.5-meter) kite will lift a science instrument three miles (5 kilometers) above Texas in an experiment by the University of Hawaii’s Shadia Habbal. She, too, wants to get above any clouds that might hamper her observations of the sun.Normally hidden by the sun’s glare, the corona is on full display during a total solar eclipse, making it a prime research target. The spiky tendrils emanating thousands of miles (kilometers) into space are mystifyingly hotter than the sun’s surface — in the millions of degrees, versus thousands.“In terms of the value of total eclipses, science still cannot explain how the corona is heated to such extreme temperatures,” said retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak, better known as Mr. Eclipse for all his charts and books on the subject.The U.S. won’t see another total solar eclipse on this scale until 2045, so NASA and everyone else is pulling out all the stops.April’s eclipse will begin in the Pacific and make landfall at Mazatlan, Mexico, heading up through Texas and 14 other U.S. states before crossing into Canada and exiting into the Atlantic at Newfoundland. Those outside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path, will get a partial eclipse.Scientists got a taste of what’s to come during the 2017 total solar eclipse that stretched from Oregon to South Carolina. This time, the moon is closer to Earth, resulting in more minutes of darkness and a wider path.“Any time we can observe for longer, that gives scientists more data,” Korreck said.Another scientific bonus this time: The sun will be just a year away from its maximum solar activity, as opposed to 2017 when it was near its minimum. That means lots more action at the sun, possibly even a coronal mass ejection during the eclipse, with massive amounts of plasma and magnetic field blasted into space.Plus there are two new spacecraft out there studying the sun: NASA’s Parker Solar Probe and the European Space Agency and NASA’s Solar Orbiter.

She also bought lobster dealerships, founded the Perfect Maine Lobster brand in 2007, and owned general stores, inns and vacation rentals on Maine’s central coast, where she lived in Port Clyde.She helped lead the effort to have Maine’s lobster industry certified as sustainable in 2013 by a London-based nonprofit, the Marine Stewardship Council — a certification that was pulled in 2022 over concern about harm to whales.Her philanthropic efforts included supporting LifeFlight of Maine medical helicopters and the Maine Botanical Gardens at Boothbay, as well as promoting the life of early 20th century illustrator and artist N.C.

Mizuhara and OhtaniMizuhara met Ohtani when he went to Japan to work as an interpreter for the Hokkaidō Nippon-Ham Fighters of Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball league, Nippon.com reported. Ohtani had joined the team as a rookie in 2013.When Ohtani, already on the rise as a coveted two-way player who excelled at pitching and hitting, signed with the Los Angeles Angels in 2017, he brought Mizuhara along with him.Interpreter Ippei Mizuhara with Shohei Ohtani, then of the Los Angeles Angels, at Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., in 2021.Brad Mangin / Sports Illustrated via Getty Images fileOhtani went on to shatter records and garner a massive fan base — and he's already widely considered one of the greatest players in baseball history at the ripe age of 29.Fans also cherished the special bond between Ohtani and his interpreter, often seen side by side during news conferences, at restaurant outings and playing catch during pregame warmups. Mizuhara also played catcher for Ohtani during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 MLB All-Star Game. Mizuhara told Nippon.com that he’s more than an interpreter for Ohtani; he is also a training partner. And off the field, they'd hang out and play video games together, he said. “My first priority is to help create an environment where he can concentrate on baseball,” he told the outlet. “We’re kind of like friends ... but more like partners.”Former Angels Manager Joe Maddon told Kyodo News in 2021 that the baseball extraordinaire and his interpreter went together like “peanut butter and jelly.”In December 2023, Ohtani made history by signing a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers — the most lucrative contract the sport has ever seen. Naturally, the club also hired Mizuhara to keep the duo together.ESPN reported that Mizuhara told the outlet he had been paid between $300,000 and $500,000 annually.Million-dollar debt and illegal gambling allegations This week's scandal first surfaced via reports by The Los Angeles Times and ESPN. ESPN reported that Mizuhara was fired after media questions that centered on the scandal.A source with knowledge of Ohtani and Mizuhara’s interactions told NBC News that the allegations centered on a number of wire transfers totaling $4.5 million from Ohtani's account that were paid to a bookmaking operation out of Southern California that is under federal investigation.The Dodgers said March 20 the team was ""aware of media reports and are gathering information,"" and confirmed Mizuhara was terminated.  Law firm Berk Brettler LLP, attorneys for Ohtani, said in a statement: ""In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities.""Mizuhara had given ESPN two conflicting stories about what happened regarding the debt. On Tuesday, he told the outlet — and Ohtani's personal team, according to the source — that he incurred the debts betting on the NBA, NFL, college football and international soccer — but never on baseball, which is prohibited by MLB rules. He said that Ohtani decided to pay the debt off for him, and stressed, “Shohei had zero involvement in betting.” According to the source, Mizuhara reportedly told Ohtani's team that the baseball star was upset and angry with him because Ohtani hates betting, but that Ohtani agreed to bail him out under the condition he never gambled again. On March 20, Mizuhara apparently changed his story, according to the person with knowledge, after a number of inquiries from the media into the allegations against him. Following an announcement to the Dodgers to expect media reports on his gambling, Ohtani pushed his interpreter for more information, prompting Mizuhara to come clean, the source said. Mizuhara then admitted to Ohtani's team that he had initially lied, and that he had authorized the wire transfers to the bookmaking operation over a period of time last year without Ohtani's knowledge or participation, the source said. Authorities were informed, according to the source, who did not specify further. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department and the Los Angeles, Anaheim and Newport Beach police departments told NBC News they do not have any record or information regarding Ohtani's filing of a police or crime report in locations tied to where he lives, plays or has a registered business.NBC News has contacted the Dodgers, representatives for Ohtani and Mizuhara seeking further comment.MLB investigation On March 22, MLB said it opened an investigation following the allegations involving Mizuhara, but did not provide more information about what exactly it is investigating. ""Major League Baseball has been gathering information since we learned about the allegations involving Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhara from the news media,"" it said in a statement. ""Earlier today, our Department of Investigations (DOI) began their formal process investigating the matter.""Mizuhara’s career, education history questionedIn addition to allegations that Mizuhara stole money from Ohtani and gambled it away, his work and education history is also under scrutiny.

Deon Cockrell.A boy on the bus was killed, and the other victim was in a Dodge Charger that had been following the bus when it was hit by the oncoming concrete truck, he said.Alejandro Anaya said he was working nearby when the crash happened and he rushed to the bus to help.“What I saw was all the kids covered in blood, crying, trying to get out,” he said.Four of those injured were taken to hospitals by helicopter and in critical condition, said Kevin Parker, a commander at Austin-Travis County EMS. Six others taken to hospitals by ground ambulance had potentially serious injuries, he said.Officials said there were additional patients with minor injuries taken to hospitals, but they didn’t have an exact count. St. David’s South Austin Medical Center said it treated 11 patients, including two in fair condition who remained in the hospital Saturday, and one who was transferred to another facility.The bus was carrying Tom Green Elementary pre-K students returning from a field trip to the Capital of Texas Zoo in Cedar Creek, about 22 miles southeast of Austin, the Hays Consolidated Independent School District has said. It said 44 students and 11 adults were on the bus.The school’s principal, Jennifer Hanna, said in a letter Saturday that three staff members and two students remained hospitalized.Two staff members face “extensive” recovery, and one was expected to be released soon, Hanna said. The hospitalized students “appear to be doing well and remain primarily for observation prior to their anticipated releases in the near future,” she said.Angelica Campos and her 5-year-old daughter, Caliana, walked away from the crash Friday. They appeared physically uninjured.“We, like, rolled on the bus,” Caliana said, her father, Hector, adding that his daughter closed her eyes to avoid airborne shards of glass.Angelica Campos said, “I spent the day with all those kids. It’s just heartbreaking.”The school, which is in the Austin suburb of Buda, will be closed on Monday, she said, but counseling would be available on campus through early evening as needed.District Superintendent Eric Wright addressed the student’s death in a letter to family, students and staff Friday: “There are no words that can express my sorrow for the student’s family, the Tom Green Elementary School family, and our greater Hays CISD community.” The district said in a statement that 2011-model bus involved in the crash was one of 40 in the district’s fleet of roughly 200 buses that lacked seatbelts, which is not uncommon for such vehicles.School buses from model years 2018 and later must have seatbelts under state law. The statement said seatbelts were a likely topic for its purchasing oversight committee, which could weigh accelerating the acquisition of new buses.“The district hopes that the DPS accident reconstruction investigation will be able to provide more information about whether a seatbelt may have made a difference for the student who died in the accident, but at this time we just don’t know that answer,” it said.Cockrell said state traffic investigators were investigating the cause of the accident, including why the concrete truck appeared to veer into oncoming traffic. The bus rolled over, authorities said.The Texas Department of Public Safety is leading the investigation.On Saturday, Hanna said in her letter that the district was still trying to contact the families of nine students in order to update them with the latest news on the crash.Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife, Cecilia Abbott, were saddened to hear about what happened, and he talked with the district’s superintendent “and offered the state’s full support as they help their community through this tragedy.”U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he’s praying for those who lost loved ones in the crash. “I am shocked and deeply saddened to hear about the school bus accident in Bastrop County today,” he said on social media platform X.",[]

He was 94.Angelos had been ill for several years. His family announced his death in a statement released by the Orioles that thanked the caregivers “who brought comfort to him in his final years.”Angelos’ death comes as his son, John, is in the process of selling the Orioles to a group headed by Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder David Rubenstein. Peter Angelos’ public role diminished significantly in his final years. According to a lawsuit involving his sons in 2022, he had surgery after his aortic valve failed in 2017.“I offer my deepest condolences to the Angelos family on the passing of Peter Angelos,” Rubenstein said in a statement. “Peter made an indelible mark first in business and then in baseball. The city of Baltimore owes him a debt of gratitude for his stewardship of the Orioles across three decades and for positioning the team for great success.”Born on the Fourth of July in 1929 and raised in Maryland by Greek immigrants, Peter Angelos rose from a blue-collar background to launch a firm in his own name after receiving his law degree from the University of Baltimore in 1961.Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos in his law office in May 2016.Kenneth K. Lam / Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesIn August 1993, Angelos led a group of investors that bought the Orioles. The group included writer Tom Clancy, filmmaker Barry Levinson and tennis star Pam Shriver. The price tag of $173 million — at the time the highest for a sports franchise — came in a sale forced by the bankruptcy of then-owner Eli Jacobs.While remaining active in a law firm specializing in personal injury cases, Angelos assumed a hands-on approach to running his hometown team. Few player acquisitions were carried out without his approval, and his reputation for not spending millions on high-priced free agents belied his net worth, which in 2017 was estimated at $2.1 billion.In 1996, his firm brought a lawsuit on behalf of the state of Maryland against tobacco giant Philip Morris, securing a $4.5 billion settlement. The Law Offices of Peter Angelos also earned millions of dollars through the settlement of asbestos cases, including a class-action suit on behalf of steel, shipyard and manufacturing facility workers.Angelos made headlines as well in baseball. In 1995, he was the only one of 28 owners who refused to adhere to a plan to use replacement players during a union strike that began during the 1994 season.“We’re duty bound to provide major league baseball to our fans, and that can’t be done with replacement players,” he insisted.At the time, Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. was only 122 games from breaking Lou Gehrig’s record of 2,130 consecutive games played. The streak would have ended if the season started with replacement players and Ripken remained on strike, but the owners and players reached an agreement before opening day and Ripken ultimately ended up extending his record run to 2,632.Angelos also fought for years to create an exhibition series between the Orioles and Cuba’s national team, a quest that reached fruition in 1999. On March 28, the Orioles played in Havana while Angelos sat alongside Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The teams met again on May 3 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.The series marked the first time the Cuban national team had faced a squad composed solely of major league players, and the first time since 1959 a big league club played in Cuba.“He’s always had an interest in politics, especially foreign policy. That, and his involvement with baseball, made it a natural thing,” said John Angelos, a son and the Orioles’ current chairman and CEO.The Orioles never won a World Series with Angelos as their owner. The team finally ended a run of 14 consecutive losing seasons in 2012, reaching the postseason under manager Buck Showalter. Baltimore made it to the American League Championship Series in 2014. But in 2018 the bottom fell out when the Orioles finished 47-115, the worst record in the majors and the franchise’s worst since it relocated from St. Louis in 1954.Showalter was fired, and a major rebuild began the following season under rookie manager Brandon Hyde. The Orioles capped a swift rise from their rebuild by winning 101 games and a division title in 2023.Though the team was rarely sensational, its home base certainly stood out. Sellout crowds were the norm after Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened in 1992. The iconic structure was built predominantly with brick, mortar and steel — much in the same fashion as old-time ballparks — and was the blueprint for other stadiums to follow.In an era when owners often sell the name of their team’s stadium or arena to advertisers with the highest bid, Angelos never succumbed to such a transaction.As he neared his 90th birthday, Angelos finally settled into the background and entrusted the operation of the team to his two sons, John and Louis.John Angelos also is president of the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, a regional network that televises Orioles and Washington Nationals games. Though both teams share ownership of MASN, the Orioles hold a large majority interest.Though known as the owner of a baseball team and successful law firm, Peter Angelos’ reach in Maryland went far deeper. He had a political career that began with an unsuccessful run for state Senate in 1958, but after that he held a seat on the Baltimore City Council from 1959 to 1963.In 1967, his bid to become Baltimore’s mayor ended in the Democratic primary.Angelos also was a player in the horse racing industry. He bought several horses and named one after his manager at the time — Showalter, who won his debut race as a 2-year-old at Laurel Race Course in 2015.",[]

The measure would keep the government funded through Sept. 30 ahead of a midnight deadline.A White House spokesperson told NBC News on Saturday that Biden ""believes it was inappropriate to abuse the process that was essential to keep the government open by including this policy targeting LGBTQI+ Americans."" ""The Administration fought against the inclusion of this policy and we will continue to work with members of Congress to find an opportunity to repeal it. We were successful in defeating 50+ other policy riders attacking the LGBTQI+ community that Congressional Republicans attempted to insert into the legislation,"" the White House spokesperson added.At least one Democrat slammed the provision. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, the progressive caucus whip, chalked it up as “laughable.”“It shows just how low the Republican Party has gotten that they’ve threatened to shut down government services over trying to figure out which flags can be flown in front of which buildings,” Casar told reporters. “I think it’s laughable, not just to Democratic voters but to Republican voters.”House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly touted the provision as a victory in a closed-door meeting with other Republican lawmakers on Wednesday morning, according to Bloomberg. Some LGBTQ advocates downplayed the provision’s impact and pointed to successful efforts from the White House and Democratic congressional leaders to remove several anti-LGBTQ provisions Republicans had originally added to the funding measure, including a limit on gender-affirming care for transgender Americans.“It poses absolutely no limits to other displays of a pride flag, hosting LGBTQ+ events or embassy employees’ ability to display Pride flags in their workplaces,” Brandon Wolf, a spokesperson for the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement Friday. “This is desperate spin from a Speaker whose MAGA members just saw their effort to hijack the appropriations process roundly rejected.”In 2019, the Trump administration began rejecting requests from U.S. embassies to display Pride flags on flagpoles during LGBTQ Pride Month. Pride flags were again allowed to fly at U.S. embassies during Pride Month after Biden was sworn into office in 2021. However, that same year, House Republicans introduced legislation, known as the “Old Glory Only Act,” which would have required the secretary of state to ensure “that no United States diplomatic or consular post flies any flag other than the United States flag over such post.” The measure was unsuccessful.On a local scale, there has also been a push to enact effective Pride flag bans. In January, Florida state lawmakers advanced a measure that would ban teachers and government employees from displaying flags that depict a “racial, sexual orientation and gender, or political ideology viewpoint.” And this month, more than 58% of voters in Hunting Beach, California, cast ballots in favor of a measure to prohibit the Pride flag and other nongovernmental banners to fly on city property.The efforts to prohibit the flag — a decades-old symbol of unity and LGBTQ equality — come as  far-right ideologues are attempting to link the flag to a trope that links gay and transgender people to child abusers who want to “groom” or sexualize children.",[]

In one entry from July 11, 2023, she wrote that it was a “big day for evil” and described an incident where her son was pushed into water and she held her hand over his nose and mouth.She wrote that she did that to help the boy.In another entry, Franke called her daughter “manipulative” and described how she forced the girl to stand in the rain for two hours.In February, Franke received four separate prison sentences of one to 15 years each. Her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, received the same sentence.Both women were arrested in August 2023 and pleaded guilty to four counts of second-degree aggravated child abuse after police found one of Franke’s sons emaciated with open wounds and bound with duct tape.The boy had escaped Hildebrandt’s home to a neighbor’s house. One of Franke’s daughters was found in Hildebrandt’s home in a similar malnourished condition.The journal entries, released by the Washington County Attorney’s Office, mainly focused on two of Franke’s six children. Officials redacted their names and identified the daughter, 9, as “E” and the son, 12, as “R.”“R was told to stand in the sun w/his sun hat,” Franke wrote in the July 11, 2023, entry. “He is defiant. ... R, or I should say his demon, stays in the shade. I push R into the sun. R comes back. I come back with a cactus poker. When I poke his back to get in the sun R doesn’t even flinch. I poke him on the neck. He is in a trance & doesn’t appear to feel anything. Jodi taps him on the cheeks to wake him up.”Franke also wrote that same day that her son was pushed into a pool and she held her hand “tightly over his nose & mouth.”In a July 12, 2023, entry, Franke wrote that she cut her daughter’s hair off and “doused” her with water in the “dog wash.”“E said she wanted to run away. Jodi told E she has no idea what is waiting for her,” Franke wrote.Prosecutors also released police body camera video, photos and interrogation tapes.In a home security video from Aug. 30, 2023, Franke’s son asked a neighbor if he could “do two favors.”“Well, what are they?” the neighbor asked.“Take me to the nearest police station,” the boy responded. “Well, actually just one is fine.”The neighbor told the boy to have a seat on his front porch.A second video showed the man on the phone as a woman assessed the boy’s injuries.“He has duct tape ... there’s sores around them,” the man said. The woman said the boy needed immediate attention.Prosecutors said that Franke and Hildebrandt were motivated by “religious extremism.”“The women appeared to fully believe that the abuse they inflicted was necessary to teach the children how to properly repent for imagined ‘sins’ and to cast the evil spirits out of their bodies,” the Washington County Attorney’s Office said in a case summary.The family became known for its popular and often controversial YouTube channel “8 Passengers,” where Franke documented her life with her husband, Kevin Franke, and their six children.The channel had more than 2 million subscribers before it ended. Kevin Franke later filed for divorce after her arrest.During her sentencing, Franke apologized to her children.“I ... believed dark was light and right was wrong,” she said. “I would do anything in this world for you. I took from you all that was soft and safe and good.”Hildebrandt said she hoped the children would be able to “heal physically and emotionally.”“One of the reasons I did not go to trial is because I did not want them to emotionally relive the experience, which would have been detrimental to them,” she said. “My hope and prayer is that they will heal and move forward to have beautiful lives.”",[]

Another brings anti-anxiety medication. A third has been watching YouTube videos narrated by pilots to understand what happens during flights. Such rituals have helped anxious passengers overcome their fear of flying. But in recent months, several travelers said, news of issues on Boeing planes has made these strategies insufficient and has threatened their ability to walk down the jetway. So they have come up with a plan: avoid flying on Boeing aircraft, even if it means re-booking flights. “I just can’t step on that plane,” said Leila Amineddoleh, an art lawyer who lives in Hoboken, New Jersey. “Even if the chance of getting hurt on a Boeing flight, even with all these incidents, is slim.”The chance is indeed slim: Aviation is the safest form of transportation by far, with significantly fewer fatalities than motor vehicles and trains, and aviation-related deaths and injuries are at nearly all-time lows.Leila Amineddoleh.Courtesy Leila AmineddolehBut after a series of quality control incidents, starting with the dramatic door panel blowout on a Boeing 737 Max midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, Amineddoleh prefers to fly on non-Boeing planes. She recently asked for a refund for upcoming flights she had booked to Miami and Europe, and bought replacement tickets on Airbus flights, despite a layover in her new Europe itinerary.“It’s an inconvenience,” she said, especially because she and her husband are traveling with their young daughter. “But I’m not going to feel guilty, because I think her safety is more important than fatigue.” Amineddoleh and three others told NBC News that the headlines about Boeing have made them uneasy, even though it’s not clear whether the problems were the result of manufacturing, maintenance or other issues. Earlier this month, flames came out of the engine of a Boeing 737-900 operated by United Airlines; dozens of injuries were reported aboard a Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by Latam Airlines that experienced a sudden drop; and a tire fell off a Boeing 777 operated by United. This week, NBC News reported on previously undisclosed issues related to a wiring flaw with the Boeing Max, which has been plagued with troubles since two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. Adding to the negative sentiment has been federal scrutiny of the safety culture at Boeing, along with the apparent suicide of a Boeing whistleblower. When asked for a response to the hesitancy among some consumers to fly on its aircraft, Boeing declined to comment. The company has previously said that it is “squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn.” Airlines have also said they are committed to safety: Alaska Airlines’ CEO “sincerely apologized” after the January blowout, and United’s CEO said in a letter to customers earlier this week that the recent incidents, while unrelated, “have our attention and have sharpened our focus.”	Still, aviation industry watchdog groups say air travelers are concerned enough that they are inquiring how they can select non-Boeing flights. An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max-9 aircraft at Los Angeles International Airport on Jan. 8, 2024.  Eric Thayer / Bloomberg via Getty Images“The good side is consumers are becoming more informed,” said Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing’s 737 factory who is now executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group The Foundation for Aviation Safety. “But here’s the sad part: You shouldn’t have to be dealing with this.”Travel search engine Kayak, which offers the option to include or exclude certain plane models from flight searches, said there has been a spike in people seeking information about types of aircraft since the door-plug blowout. “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January,” Kayak CEO Steve Hafner said in a statement, adding that use of the filter was 15 times higher in January than in December but has since dipped to 10 times higher.Both Kayak and aviation experts cautioned that airlines often substitute planes at the last minute, so customers who book non-Boeing aircraft may end up getting a Boeing anyway. There aren’t many other options: Planes made by Airbus, and sometimes Embraer, are the other common ones for major carriers.Stephanie Walls.Courtesy Stephanie WallsSome airlines don’t fly Boeing planes at all — including Spirit and JetBlue. Others, such as Southwest, operate an all-Boeing 737 fleet.Stephanie Walls, an IT project manager who lives in Houston and describes herself as an anxious flyer, said she recently changed an upcoming flight to Philadelphia to be on an Airbus. Despite the routines she has created to make flying less nerve-wracking — including praying, choosing a window seat and watching the flight tracker — she is not confident that Boeing has taken enough action to improve the safety of its planes.Adrian Rojas.Courtesy Adrian Rojas“We really need to see that change being put in place pretty urgently,” Walls said.Adrian Rojas, a Chicago-based communications consultant for a labor union, has done therapy to ease his fear of flying and takes anti-anxiety medication on flights. Unlike the other passengers who said they are avoiding all Boeing planes, Rojas specifically doesn’t want to fly Boeing’s Max series — and changed a return flight from Austin, Texas, for next month so he could be on an Airbus instead of a 737 Max.“I just know that it’s something I would be thinking about a lot right as I get on the plane, so I’m just trying to limit that for my mental health,” he said.Leonyce Moses.Courtesy Leonyce MosesEven some passengers who feel relaxed in the sky are changing their flights. Leonyce Moses, a consultant who lives in Richmond, Virginia, loves to travel and said she flew one to two times a month last year. She had to pay about $70 extra to change an upcoming Phoenix trip to be on an Airbus instead of a Boeing plane, but “it was worth it for my safety,” she said. She acknowledged that aviation is very safe but said she is spooked nonetheless.“I am not willing to take that risk,” Moses said.A clinically diagnosed extreme fear of flying, known as aerophobia or aviophobia, is rare: Some estimates put it as low as 2.5% of the population. But as much as 40% of people say they have anxiety about flying.The condition is treatable, according to Elizabeth Austin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UMass Chan Medical School. She recommended cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy, which she said can be done using virtual reality programs that simulate getting on a plane.She said she supported people with a phobia of flying switching their tickets to be on different aircraft — as long as they are realistic about how few dangers they face on any plane.“It’s still an extraordinarily low-risk situation,” she said.That is not enough for flyers like Amineddoleh to get on a Boeing plane. But she thinks she will be open to it again — someday.“I really do hope that things change at Boeing, in part because it really makes my life easier,” she said. “When I fly to Europe, I always take direct flights. It’s the first time in years that I haven’t.”",[]

As young locals leave in search of better jobs, Central American migrants have been taking their places in the slaughterhouses, especially after Costco opened a huge rotisserie chicken facility in 2019.“We need these people,” said Mark Jensen, president of the city council. “We need this work done. This is what feeds the nation and the world.”The meatpacking town of Fremont, Nebraska, has seen an influx of Hispanic migrants in recent years. Hispanic businesses have opened to serve them.NBC NewsBut instead of a welcome mat, for more than a decade Fremont has had a controversial law on the books that tries to bar undocumented migrants from living within city limits. In 2010, residents voted 57% to 43% to require that all people renting property in Fremont must first sign a declaration that they are legally present in the U.S.“The city’s citizens asked the city council to do something because it was pretty obvious that we had just become a haven for illegals,” said city council member Paul Von Behren.Brenda Ray, who has lived in the Fremont area for 40 years, said she noted the change in the city’s population and voted for the ordinance back in 2010. She said she doesn’t “have a problem” with the Central American arrivals “if they are legal and they come in to speak American English.”She wishes the rule, known as Ordinance 5165, “accomplished more,” but still supports it.“It’s something that we have in our toolbox,” she said. “If we have a big problem we can fall back on it.”The factories need workers, however, and the migrants have kept coming. By 2022 a town that was once nearly all white had become 16% Latino, according to census data, and the number has risen since. Many of the most recent arrivals are from Guatemala. The Guatemalan consulate in Omaha says there are at least 2,020 Guatemalans in Fremont and the true figure could be 45% higher.Maria Hernandez and her husband, Vicente, pastors at one of the local Guatemalan churches, Dios es Amor #2, said their flock has grown from three congregants to 200 in seven years. They say many members work at the slaughterhouses, making it a frequent topic of prayer.Fremont residents Vicente (left) and Maria Hernandez operate a Guatemalan church in town and say they’ve seen their congregation grow with new migrant arrivals.Courtesy of Maria Hernandez“I tell them that we have to give thanks because God has put in men who have companies,” Maria said. “If it weren’t for these companies we wouldn’t have a job.”Vicente also works at one of the local slaughterhouses, cleaning the kill floor on the overnight shift. He thinks the city and the migrants are a good match.“With Hispanic migrants, although it is hard, although it is heavy, they endure,” said Vicente. Between the church and the plant, he said, he gets three hours of sleep a night.Jensen worked in the meatpacking industry for 40 years and says he’s seen how these jobs have become less attractive to native-born Americans.“These are very physical jobs,” Jensen said. “And a lot of it’s hard work. And it’s not something that a lot of people can do.”Some complain, however, that undocumented workers steal identities to get the jobs.In 2021, a fraudulent document ring was uncovered in Fremont. Federal investigators found “hundreds of counterfeit federal and state identity cards,” according to court filings. Just last month, four slaughterhouse workers were charged with using other people’s Social Security numbers. Glenn Elwell, who investigated the cases as head of Nebraska’s Department of Motor Vehicles fraud unit, said he wasn’t surprised they were in Fremont. “A good majority of our cases are usually in and around cities and towns with meatpacking plants.”‘A burden to the taxpayers’Driving around Fremont, the Guatemalan presence is tangible, from local shops offering Latino foods to ads for remittance services. Many of the immigrant arrivals live in a mobile home neighborhood less than five minutes from the city’s plants.“Work is a blessing,” said local store owner Gaspar Larios. “Now there are Guatemalans who have houses, their own homes in the United States.”Larios and his wife run a small shop where they sell a type of traditional, colorful Guatemalan clothing called trajes — a piece of their home country that people still wear around town for special events.The arrival of migrants has transformed the community and kept the slaughterhouses humming, but many residents note that it has also created a strain on city services. “Just the sheer pressure of bringing in numbers of people has resulted in a considerable burden to the taxpayers,” said Von Behren, of the city council. In the past four years, the school system has added 600 kids who don’t speak English as a first language. Of the most recent Guatemalan arrivals, 40% or more speak an Indigenous language called Kʼicheʼ, according to community organizer Antonio Lopez.Councilman Paul Von Behren says he supports an ordinance requiring individuals to state whether they are legally in the U.S. to rent housing.NBC NewsBut efforts have also been made to welcome newcomers.A Fremont schoolteacher has started to learn K’iche’ to connect with students and their parents. The local hospital has hired a K’iche’ translator.Jessica Kolterman, a director at Costco’s local chicken plant, told the local paper last year that her team holds language classes for workers. And she said her company rewards hard work: “If you come into this team and you want to work hard and grow, that opportunity is there in front of you.”Costco did not respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, migrants who need to rent housing keep showing up at city hall to sign declarations that they are in the U.S. legally and pay $5 for an occupancy license. The city clerk’s office said it gets three to five of the declarations a day from migrants and other applicants.The clerk’s office also said it was unaware of any cases that required further action, like finding that someone who signed a declaration was actually in the U.S. illegally, but referred NBC News to the police department for confirmation. The police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.One of the reasons there may be no cases is that the law doesn’t actually require applicants for occupancy licenses to provide any proof of legal presence in the U.S.Aware that the measure could be a lightning rod for legal challenges when it was first passed in 2010, the city imposed a special short-term tax to raise a legal fund that now holds more than $1.3 million. For many years, it also paid a $10,000 annual retainer to lawyer Kris Kobach — the same anti-immigration activist who helped write the law and others like it in towns across the nation. (Kobach, who is now attorney general of Kansas, no longer has a contract with Fremont.)As expected, the American Civil Liberties Union fought the law as soon as it was passed, but ultimately lost. The absence of language compelling renters to prove their right to be in the U.S. is part of the reason the ordinance survived legal challenge. It’s also why it is legally toothless.Von Behren, who supports the rule, concedes it is unenforceable. Jensen, who opposes it, said that trying to enforce it against a particular migrant could invite more legal fights. He compared it to 19th-century laws that stay on the books long past their relevance.“Basically,” he said, “it’s like the laws that are on the books for where you can hit your horse.”Vicente Hernandez, however, said it still has an impact beyond the filing fee.“When it’s something like this, it’s not like the people who [voted for it] left [Fremont],” he said. “Those people still live here.”He and Maria said they still feel like they’ve found their new hometown.“Now I live the American dream, as they call it,” said Maria.",[]

Frustrated, her brother and his now-wife began pushing local authorities to hand off the case to state investigators.That summer, after a protest over the lack of progress and persistent advocacy from the couple, Michigan State Police took over and began unraveling the horrific mystery of who entered Covington’s home, bound her with Christmas lights and fired a single bullet into a pillow pressed against her head.In an exclusive interview with “Dateline,” one of the state investigators who took over the case pointed to what he described as an overlooked clue that was key to solving the crime — cellphone location data gathered through an investigative technique known as a geofence warrant.The increasingly popular and much-debated surveillance tool has allowed law enforcement agencies to gather anonymous location data for anyone whose location history is turned on — the setting is off by default — and is in a designated area during a designated time, according to Google. That area could be a one-block radius or several. Investigators use that data to unmask and track a potential suspect’s movements in or around a crime scene as the crime played out.In Covington’s case, the data helped lead investigators to three men who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to prison in October.“That was the first piece of evidence that really broke the case wide open,” one of the investigators, James Plummer, told “Dateline.” But a recent announcement from the main recipient of most geofence warrants, Google, has left the tool’s future in doubt — and investigators searching for their next source of data in a post-Google world. Throughout 2024, the company said in December, changes will be introduced so that users’ location data is unavailable to Google, making collaboration with law enforcement impossible.“This is all pretty new still,” said Adam Scott Wandt, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who has trained law enforcement investigators across the country on the technique. “I can pretty confidently say I haven’t started lecturing or providing solutions. But I can also confidently say that we’re all talking about where to go from here.”What may follow, warned Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director of the civil liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation, could resemble the Wild West.A reliable source for pinpointing whereabouts Detectives James Plummer, left, and Sean Street.DatelineWandt wasn’t sure who first approached Google asking for user location data, but the technique offered details similar to a cell tower ping. The difference, he said, is that Google’s data — which users agree to provide when they agree to conditions of using the company’s services — appeared far more accurate. The information was stored on a massive, internal company database known as “Sensorvault,” which made it searchable and accessible to law enforcement that obtain warrants. And the company’s products that collect such data are ubiquitous, Wandt said. “Google is this one resource where, even if you have an iPhone, you’re gonna have a Google product,” he said.Google has said its first requests for geofence data came in 2016. By 2020, that number had ballooned to more than 11,000. Nearly 20% of the requests sent to Google between 2018 and 2020 were from agencies in California.Google insisted that authorities obtain a warrant if they wanted the data, and the company developed a multistep process for investigators to follow, said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement.”The process begins with anonymized data and may end with an unmasked suspect, according to court records that describe the warrant process.In Covington’s case, a detective with the Van Buren Police Department obtained data from a geofence warrant in 2020. But the agency discounted it because it came from a phone that didn’t belong to the person of interest, the state investigator said.“They had it and they just never looked into it because they were so focused” on the wrong person, Plummer said.Van Buren Police Chief Jason Wright said state police have told him nothing about their investigation, so he didn’t want to comment on their findings.“They went and did their own thing,” Wright said. “They did a good job. I can’t comment on things they didn’t share with me.” Wrong place, wrong timeIn 2020, Michigan State Police began unraveling the horrific mystery of who entered Covington’s home, bound her with Christmas lights and fired a single bullet into a pillow pressed against her head.DatelineSince geofence warrants require considerable manpower and analysis, they’ve often been reserved for serious crimes, Wandt said. Authorities investigating the Jan. 6 riots used geofence data, he said, and detectives investigating the killing of four Idaho college students in 2022 relied on a similar technique. Wandt said he’s unaware of research showing how effective the tool is at solving crime, but he called it a lawful and legitimate tactic. “A powerful technological shortcut to find unknown people by their location,” is how Ferguson described it.But as the tool grew in popularity, so did its critics.  Civil liberties advocates described the warrants as dangerous and unconstitutional dragnets that unfairly cast everyone within the fence’s perimeter as potential criminals. They’ve pointed to innocent bystanders who’ve mistakenly been swept up in that perimeter, including a man in Florida whose exercise app placed him near a burglary and a man in Arizona wrongfully accused of murder.“Essentially what this does, it’s a tool that just based on someone’s location, which is recorded by their phone or another device, it turns everyone in an area into a criminal suspect, just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time,” said Chad Marlow, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union.Remaining under an “umbrella of criminal suspicion” is especially dangerous if the potential suspect is not white, Marlow added. A Google spokesperson said the company has tried to protect the privacy of users “while supporting the important work of law enforcement.” “We examine each demand for legal validity, consistent with developing case law, and we routinely push back against overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data, including objecting to some demands entirely,” the spokesperson said.Still, lawyers and civil liberties groups challenged the technique in courts and statehouses. Bills that ban the practice in California and New York have stalled, Marlow said, but in separate criminal cases where geofence data was used to arrest suspects — one in California and another in Virginia — an appeals court and a federal judge found that the technique violated the Fourth Amendment. In a 2023 decision, the California appeals court wrote that the warrant obtained in the case — which sought all location data for an apartment building, three gas stations, a strip mall and a bank — lacked the “particularity” required by the Constitution and was “impermissibly overbroad.”It isn’t clear if lawyers for the men who pleaded guilty to Covington’s killing objected to the use of a geofence warrant. The attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.A shift at Google Egypt Covington.DatelineIn December, Google announced an overhaul to its location history policy that will move users’ data from the Sensorvault to their phones. Under the new rules, if a user wants to save their location history to the cloud, the announcement says, “We’ll automatically encrypt your backed-up data so no one can read it, including Google.”In the announcement, the company didn’t say what prompted the change, which is expected to roll out through 2024. A Google spokesperson cited privacy tools like Incognito and auto-delete and described the December announcement as part of a broader effort to give users more control over their data.Experts said the overhaul will effectively end Google’s ability to respond to requests for location history data — a shift the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has also backed legal and legislative challenges to the technique, described as “fantastic” news.Ferguson described the overhaul as good for privacy and bad for police — a move that “forecloses the ability to search the entire dataset of digital signals for an unknown suspect,” he said. “Police can still confirm their suspicions if they get access to the device, but they cannot find the device or its owner with the same ease.”Ferguson noted that many smartphone apps that aren’t owned by Google also collect user location data. But Crocker, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said it’s unclear if the more common ones — like Facebook or X — store that data as Google did, on a searchable, internal database. (Neither Facebook’s parent company, Meta, nor X responded to requests for comment.)This means law enforcement agencies may turn to data brokers, or companies that buy personal information — including location data from app companies— and sell it, civil liberties advocates and law enforcement technology experts said. Wandt said he’s already fielded requests from law enforcement personnel to help them figure out how to get this data. And some agencies have already turned to this model. One company bought location information from data brokers and sold it via a subscription to law enforcement agencies, which it had contracts with, a 2022 investigation by The Associated Press and Electronic Frontier Foundation found. The company tracks phones through anonymous advertising IDs that authorities can potentially use to identify people’s homes and workplaces, the AP reported.The firm declined to tell the AP how many law enforcement agencies it worked with but said it hoped to “fill a gap for underfunded and understaffed departments.”Experts warned that there are no rules for this model, despite efforts in Congress to regulate data brokers. “In an investigation where law enforcement wants to see location data of lots of users in a specific place, they may go to one of those data brokers and say, ‘Search your database for all the records you’ve bought from these various third parties and tell us who was there and they may do that, without a warrant at all,” Crocker said, referring to the anonymized data. “It seems to make a mockery of the Fourth Amendment.”It’s not illegal for the government to use these services, Wandt said. “But the data broker model certainly needs federal regulation.”Google’s requirement for a warrant was a corporate policy, not a legal mandate, Ferguson said, noting that one consequence of the company’s December announcement is that “less thoughtful actors” could become law enforcement’s go-to source for location data. “There is nothing stopping a location tracking company from directly selling all our data to law enforcement,” he said, adding: “It is a sad commentary that privacy is more dependent on corporate tech policy than courts or legislatures.”CLARIFICATION (March 22, 2024, 11 p.m. ET): This article has been updated to clarify that a Google user’s location history, which is off by default, must be turned on for the data to be available to law enforcement.",[]

The official said the military is not actively contacting those relatives but instead is asking people who suspect a loved one may be included in that tally to email the military to reclaim the remains. “It’s mainly in order to not retraumatize families,” the official added of the decision not to proactively inform families. “Some of these are from many, many years ago.” The Pentagon’s Inspector General warned that because the medical examiner did not keep complete and accurate records for retained organs, officials may not be able to effectively answer families’ questions, which “could cause emotional distress.”The Inspector General’s review included more than 200 autopsies spanning from 2006 through 2022. Investigators found that the military failed to record relatives’ wishes in more than half of the cases reviewed. And when they did record their requests for the disposal of their remains, they failed to follow them in 41% of the cases. Autopsies are performed inside the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System's building in Dover, Delaware. Courtesy U.S. Air Force fileIn one case from 2010, the next of kin asked for organs retained during an autopsy to be cremated and delivered to a specific location, the report said. But as of last March, the organs were not cremated and remained in the medical examiner’s inventory.In response to the findings, the Department of Defense is taking steps to analyze and modernize its medical examiner’s tracking system, the agency said in a letter to the Inspector General. “There are two distinct ethical failures here,” said Eli Shupe, an assistant professor of bioethics at the University of Texas at Arlington, who reviewed the report at NBC News’ request. “There’s the failure to notify families, and then there’s a failure to respect the wishes of the next of kin when they’ve gone through the trouble of soliciting those wishes.”She noted that the IG report warned the findings could be upsetting to people whose relatives may be included in the 433, as they may be unaware that the bodies they buried or cremated were incomplete.“This kind of negligence is something that people will find extremely distressing,” Shupe said, “if they find out that their father’s organs were retained and maybe disposed of without their knowledge or against their wishes.”The military revised its policy in September 2022 and no longer requires its medical staff to notify family members if organs are retained during an autopsy.",[]

Mark Gordon, a Republican, would have required facilities providing surgical abortions to be licensed as outpatient surgical centers, adding to their cost and the burdens they face to operate.Women would have had to get ultrasounds no less than 48 hours before either a surgical or pill abortion to determine the fetus’s gestational age and location and viability of the pregnancy.Abortion is legal in Wyoming pending the outcome of a lawsuit challenging new laws to ban the procedure. The bill was aimed at the state’s only full-service abortion clinic, Wellspring Health Access. The Casper facility opened in 2023 — almost a year later than planned after being badly burned in an arson attack by a woman who opposed abortion.Gordon said in announcing the veto that the measure would have “properly regulated” clinics. But he said amendments added by lawmakers made it vulnerable to legal challenge.“The state is closer than ever to a decision on the constitutionality of abortion in Wyoming,” Gordon said in a statement, adding that the bill “had the potential to further delay the resolution of this critical issue for the unborn.”Most abortions at Wellspring are administered through pills but the clinic has been able to perform surgical abortions as well, according to clinic officials who opposed the bill.The measure would have required abortions at any clinic to be provided only by a licensed physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 10 miles away.The result would have been major new costs to renovate Wellspring to meet ambulatory surgical facility standards while getting “medically unnecessary” admitting privileges for its doctors, clinic founder Julie Burkhart said in an emailed statement. Women also faced added travel and time-off-work costs to meet the ultrasound requirement, Burkhart added.She said the bill was meant to close down the clinic, which would hurt people who are in need of abortion services.“Outlawing abortion will never serve as a vehicle for making this health care obsolete,” she said.Last year, the Wyoming Legislature passed — and Gordon signed into law — measures that restrict abortion in the state, including the first-in-the-U.S. explicit ban on abortion pills. Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens in Jackson has put the laws on hold while considering lawsuits against them filed by Wellspring and others.At a hearing in December, Owens said she planned to issue a ruling rather than let the lawsuit go to trial. On Monday, however, she sent all major questions in the case to the state Supreme Court to consider instead.Owens has shown sympathy for Wyoming’s abortion-rights supporters. She has said they are likely to prevail, for example, with their argument that abortion is allowed under a 2012 state constitutional amendment, which states that competent adults have the right to make their own health care decisions.Attorneys for Wyoming counter that the amendment — approved in response to the federal Affordable Care Act — was never intended to apply to abortion.Wyoming’s latest abortion bill faced a higher bar just to be debated in this year’s legislative session, which ended March 8. Bills in the four-week session not related to the budget needed a two-thirds vote to be introduced.“Those of us who stand for legislation like this, we know deep down that life has meaning beyond this floor,” Sen. Dan Dockstader, a Republican from Afton, said in a debate before the bill passed the Senate on a 24-6 vote March 1.The bill earlier cleared the state House with a 53-9 vote.While rejecting the abortion bill, Gordon signed into law a measure that makes Wyoming the latest state to ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, saying he supports the bill’s protections for minors. He added, however, that he also thinks such legislation amounts to the government “straying into the personal affairs of families.”At least 24 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for minors, and most of those states have been sued. A federal judge struck down Arkansas’ ban as unconstitutional.

It had paused IVF procedures in the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling in February that frozen embryos can be considered children. Two patients at the Center for Reproductive Medicine in Mobile said they were told on Friday that certain IVF procedures would resume on April 1. A spokesperson for the clinic did not immediately confirm this but told NBC News earlier in the week that the facility had started scheduling embryo transfer appointments.Robin Banks, 39, said she and her husband, Joshua, 42, had planned to create embryos in early March. Now, after weeks of limbo, they learned Friday that they would be able to move forward. Robin Banks had decided to freeze her eggs in 2017 after learning she had ovarian cancer and that chemotherapy could affect her fertility. Almost a decade later, in remission and newly married, she was ready to start a family when the court ruling landed.“It’s just disappointing that all this is happening just weeks before we were given our chance,” Robin Banks said earlier this week.Robin and Joshua Banks learned after weeks of limbo that they would be able to move forward with IVF.Courtesy Robin BanksThe couple moved from Colorado to Fairhope, Alabama, a city just outside Mobile, two years ago. Before their procedure was rescheduled, Joshua Banks said he was considering whether they would need to move again. The Supreme Court ruling sprang from wrongful death claims against the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Mobile Infirmary. In 2020, according to the ruling, a hospital patient removed several embryos from the clinic’s freezer, but the temperature “freeze-burned” the patient’s hand, causing them to drop the embryos, destroying them. The court ruled that a state law “applies to all children, born and unborn, without limitation.”   The Center for Reproductive Medicine was one of at least three IVF providers in the state to halt services after the court’s decision. Advocacy groups and health law experts argued that the court’s ruling posed legal risks to IVF medical staff and patients. And providers questioned whether they would be forced to take on additional insurance costs.Under mounting pressure from local patients and a national outcry, Alabama legislators passed a measure to protect IVF in the state. On March 6, Gov. Kay Ivey signed a new state law protecting clinics from criminal or civil liability for their operations. “Let me say clearly: Alabama supports growing families through IVF,” she said in a statement at the time.Although two of the three providers — Alabama Fertility and the University of Alabama at Birmingham — quickly announced that the law’s passage would allow them to resume treatments, the Center for Reproductive Medicine initially opted to keep its IVF services on hold.  A spokesperson for Mobile Infirmary and the clinic said it would not reopen until it had “legal clarification on the extent of immunity provided by the new Alabama law.”  Earlier this week, George Gigicos, a spokesperson for the Center for Reproductive Medicine, told NBC News that the clinic had started rescheduling transfer appointments, though doctors, attorneys and Mobile Infirmary staff were still reviewing the new law.“Once they figure that out, then we’ll be able to either resume or not resume — but that decision has not been made yet,” he said. Gigicos did not immediately answer follow-up questions on Friday.Katey Lofton, 33, another patient at the clinic, had been waiting since last fall to have her embryo transferred to her uterus in early March, when she learned the court’s ruling meant the procedure would be delayed. She sent letters to state representatives urging them to protect IVF and encouraged loved ones to do the same.Lofton got a call last week from her nurse that she’d been rescheduled for March 26, and then learned Friday that at least some procedures weren't resuming until April 1, which meant another delay.“Here we were hopes up again — you know, thought we caught a break just to be kicked back down,"" Lofton said Friday. ""It’s frustrating. It’s hard not to get angry."" Caroline Chism, 35, said she wouldn’t have her 10-month-old son without the Center for Reproductive Medicine. She and her husband planned to have another embryo transferred to give him a sibling, but the clinic’s pause put those dreams on hold.After NBC News told her that the clinic had started rescheduling transfers, she called for a status update and was able to schedule a consult about her transfer.She was relieved that some services were resuming, but said that, because of the ruling, nothing’s guaranteed.“Thinking of the possibility this doesn’t get rectified, and we aren’t offered solutions — that would be a scary thought to not have access to our embryo,” she said.",[]

She said she tried to schedule appointments at local clinics to get a birth control prescription last year, only to find out that the earliest slots were months away, during her final exams.“That’s not access to me,” she said. “This is fulfilling the gap that I experienced, that I know for a fact that other students have also experienced.”The Food and Drug Administration approved Opill for over-the-counter sales in July, but the drug’s maker, Perrigo, didn’t start shipping batches to retailers and pharmacies until March 4. The Opill website shows a map of stores that carry or are expected to carry the pill. Walgreens estimated that Opill would be at all of its stores within the next week or so. Several stores in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut confirmed to NBC News that the product had made it to shelves.“Opill will be available at Walgreens nationwide in the family planning aisle and behind the pharmacy. Customers can also purchase the product online for 30-minute pickup, 1-hour delivery, or ship to home,” Marty Maloney, a company spokesperson, said in a statement.Matt Blanchette, a CVS spokesperson, said the pharmacy chain started selling Opill online on Thursday, but the product hasn’t hit shelves yet.“In early April, more than 7,500 CVS Pharmacy stores will offer Opill and for added privacy and convenience, customers will be able to choose same-day delivery or buy online and pick up in store,” he said.Walmart spokesperson Tricia Moriarty said Opill is expected to be available on the store's website at the end of this week, but as of Friday afternoon the pills were listed as “out of stock.” Opill will also be available at all Walmart stores the first week of April, Moriarty said.The medication costs $19.99 for a one-month supply and $49.99 for a three-month supply at most stores, though Walmart lists slightly lower prices online. Opill contains one hormone, progestin, which makes it harder for sperm to reach an egg, thins the lining of the uterus and can sometimes prevent ovulation. This type of birth control, known as the “mini pill,” is taken at the same time each day. The common prescription forms of birth control, known as “combination pills,” contain synthetic versions of both estrogen and progestin.When used as directed, Opill's effectiveness can be as high as 98%, meaning just 2 out of 100 women will become pregnant in a year of use. The effectiveness of combination pills can reach 99%.A prescription version of Opill was approved more than 50 years ago under the brand name Ovrette, and was available in the U.S. from 1973 to 2005. Over-the-counter birth control pills were already available in more than 100 countries before Opill was approved in the U.S. in July.Srinivasan spoke about the need for over-the-counter birth control pills at an FDA advisory committee meeting last year.“I really felt like I was the voice for a lot of young people in that moment. … I got a tattoo of a little birth control pack after I spoke to the FDA,” she said.Srinivasan added, though, that she worries that even $20 per month might feel expensive after she starts medical school this fall.Under the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans are required to cover certain types of contraceptives at no out-of-pocket cost. But over-the-counter medications generally aren’t covered. However, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank, seven states — California, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Washington — require private health insurance plans that are subject to state law to cover some nonprescription contraceptives. Many of those policies should be broad enough to include Opill, according to KFF — but the majority of plans are only subject to federal, not state, law. Seven states also have funds set aside to cover nonprescription contraceptives for Medicaid beneficiaries.",[]

The new home will be able to withstand future hurricanes and uses solar energy.The Biden administration has invested a total of $140 billion in Puerto Rico across multiple sectors, including education and disaster response, Harris said in her speech. She also emphasized investments in small businesses, entrepreneurs, infrastructure and renewable energy initiatives.""There's more work to do,"" Harris added. Harris also commemorated the 151st anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico when it was under Spanish rule, alongside community leaders and artists in San Juan dedicated to celebrating the island's cultural heritage and its African influence.Since Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and not a state, people living in the island can’t vote in presidential elections even though they are U.S. citizens by birth.But political parties allow them to participate in the primaries that help elect presidential nominees.The Democratic primary in Puerto Rico is scheduled for April 28, and the Republican primary for April 21.Close to 6 million Puerto Ricans live in the U.S. mainland, many in competitive states like Florida and Pennsylvania. Biden-Harris supporters hope that touting the wins of the Biden administration in Puerto Rico can influence Latino voters of Puerto Rican heritage who live in the U.S. mainland and can register to vote in presidential elections.Charlie Rodríguez, president of the Democratic Party in Puerto Rico, told NBC News he viewed the vice president's visit as ""a reiteration of the policies established by the President since he stepped into the White House, of staying focused on Puerto Rico a during his term.""More often than not, people living in Puerto Rico don’t always see how decisions made in Congress and the White House affect their daily lives, Rodríguez said, adding that under the Biden administration investments in infrastructure and economic recovery  has allowed for the revitalization of roads and some decaying buildings, the ongoing reconstruction of the electrical grid, and the expansion of federal nutrition programs and education funds.‘These have extraordinary impact,” he added. “That’s why we have to continue spreading that message.”Harris’ trip comes a week after first lady Jill Biden visited Puerto Rico.Harris' visit also drew protests, as dozens of Puerto Ricans like Joseline Velásquez, a spokesperson for the group Jornada: Se Acabaron Las Promesas, first gathered near Condado in San Juan and blasted the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, expressing concerns over U.S. involvement in Haiti and expressing discontent over Puerto Rico's recovery.Several counter-protesters in favor of the vice president's visit showed up to San Juan Friday afternoon, chanting pro-statehood remarks.“It is disrespectful,"" Velásquez of the group Jornada: Se Acabaron Las Promesas, told Telemundo Puerto Rico in Spanish, adding that she believed Harris' main purpose for her visit is to ""walk through the streets of Puerto Rico to raise funds for the electoral campaign."" (Telemundo is part of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)The Biden Victory Fund political action committee organized a fundraising event in an apartment complex owned by investor Nicholas Prouty, Puerto Rican national newspaper El Nuevo Día first reported. Harris stopped by the event before leaving the island.Prouty, a New York native, is most known in Puerto Rico for being one of the estimated 6,000 wealthy investors who have moved to the island following tax breaks if they buy a residency in Puerto Rico and live there at least half of the year.But in political circles, Prouty is a longtime campaign donor;  Federal Election Commission records show Prouty has contributed to the campaigns of multiple Democratic candidates such as Biden, Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton since at least 2008. Fewer campaign contributions were done in favor of Republican candidates.Rodríguez said it's common practice, especially during an election year, that elected officials take time from their official visits to participate in a fundraising event.""There is no doubt that there are a number of people in Puerto Rico who are in a better position to be able to contribute generous amounts, within the framework of what's allowed by federal law, and to give those types of donations,"" Rodríguez said in Spanish.The U.S. Government Accountability Office is currently investigating the controversial tax breaks, known locally as Act 22, after four Democratic members of the House Natural Resources Committee requested they review parts of the Puerto Rico tax incentives law that may be allowing wealthy individuals from the U.S. mainland and some businesses to avoid significant taxes.The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has also said it is investigating about 100 high-income individuals who attempted to avoid U.S. taxation by benefiting from a controversial tax break in Puerto Rico without meeting the appropriate requirements.For more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

The company’s smart gun is designed to serve a very specific purpose: a weapon that can be quickly accessed to defend against a home intruder, but that can’t be used by anyone unauthorized, particularly children. As Biofire markets its gun to firearm enthusiasts and skeptics alike, the company is walking a careful line to avoid the massive blowback from the gun-rights movement that derailed previous iterations of smart guns.Gun control advocates have long seen biometric technology as a game changer for reducing gun violence, and Biofire has drawn their praise by emphasizing safety and the need to prevent children from accessing guns. At the same time, the company has built ties with the gun industry and opposes any government mandates to require biometric features in guns, trying to head off fears that the technology is a Trojan horse for gun control. So far, Biofire’s approach has been received with a mix of cautious optimism, curiosity and distrust. But the most important question won’t be fully answered until the gun is in people’s hands: Does it really work? “I don’t want to be the first guy to find out,” said Pierre Salomon, who runs a firearms training company in Massachusetts. “I don’t think the technology is there for me to be putting my life on the line — and my family’s life on the line.”Biofire says its smart gun has undergone rigorous testing and has a battery that can last months on a single charge.Courtesy BiofireKai Kloepfer, the company’s CEO and founder, says its $1,499 gun is reliable and thoroughly tested. More than twice as expensive as a typical handgun, it isn’t just a standard firearm with biomechanical sensors affixed. When an authorized user pulls the trigger, it sends an electric signal to fire the bullet, rather than rely on a physical trigger mechanism — the first gun ever designed to fire that way, the company says.“It’s just a very, very different approach and one that has involved rigorous testing and validation of every single piece of the system,” said Kloepfer, who compares the complexity of his product to a “small satellite.”Kloepfer began trying to develop a smart gun as a high school student who had been rattled by the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting. He dropped out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to focus on the product, ultimately raising more than $37 million in venture capital and private funds.Biofire says its first batch of smart guns will go to investors, friends and others in the firm’s inner circle this month. In the following months, Biofire’s first paid customers — who number in the “thousands,” the company said, declining to be more specific — will be receiving their orders. Biofire said roughly a third of them are first-time gun owners. The gun is designed to allow up to five authorized people to fire the weapon instantly upon gripping it, and to disable the trigger mechanism the moment it leaves their hand. That should help prevent unintentional shootings by children, as well as teen suicides, theft and criminal use of the weapons, Kloepfer said. “It’s unfortunately common that a kid finds a gun in a purse, or a kid finds a gun in a drawer and plays with it,” Kloepfer said. The biometric technology won’t work if users’ faces and hands are completely covered, but Biofire says that shouldn’t be a problem, since it’s meant to be used at home. The company’s website shows the gun stored on a bookshelf behind a family watching TV and above a kitchen counter with kids nearby. Kai Kloepfer, CEO and founder of Biofire, began trying to develop a smart gun as a high school student rattled by the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colo.Matt Mills McKnight / ReutersThere are no federal product safety regulations for any firearms, including Biofire’s gun, due to a carveout in the 1972 consumer protection law, and there are no industry standards for testing biometric weapons. Biofire’s smart gun meets safety requirements for consumer electronics, as well as handgun safety standards that some states have established, the company said. Kloepfer added that Biofire’s fingerprint and facial-recognition sensors are designed to be far more reliable than a smartphone; people typically grip a weapon in a more consistent position that makes it easier to unlock accurately through fingerprints or facial capture. The product has undergone rigorous testing under conditions including a wide range of temperatures and sweaty palms, and has a battery that can last months on a single charge, he said.The promise of this technology has led many safety advocates to champion the development of smart guns as a critical breakthrough for reducing gun injuries and deaths. At a primary debate in 2019, Joe Biden declared that “no gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger.” The website for his 2020 presidential campaign included a call to “put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns,” without specifying how that would be achieved. In a statement, the White House said Biden ""has not proposed a specific requirement for smart gun tech,"" but supports accelerating the market for smart guns. Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown, a gun control advocacy group, sees Biofire as a potential step in that direction. “This could be the beginning of everybody opting in on safer firearms,” Suplina said. “As Biofire enters the marketplace, there is going to be pressure on other manufacturers to create similar products.”Leading gun-rights advocates have not embraced Biofire’s smart gun with the same enthusiasm. Instead, they have stressed that they do not oppose smart gun technology itself, but rather any government plan to use it as a means to control which types of guns can be sold. Some have also raised the concern that smart guns could be disabled remotely, including by the government. Biofire says remote access to its gun is not possible. Biofire's biometric weapon uses fingerprint and facial recognition to identify authorized users.Courtesy BiofireAidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, said these and other concerns will lead a lot of gun owners to be “extremely skeptical” about smart guns. “What these so-called smart guns do is lock your firearm so it’s inaccessible in certain situations when you’re going to want it — like a life-or-death situation,” he said.Gun-rights activists helped shut down the last major attempt to sell a smart gun in the U.S. in 2014, when a German company called Armatix introduced a gun equipped with radio-frequency technology that used a specialized wristband to authorize users. The NRA and others tested the weapon and criticized it for technical flaws including misfires and unlocking without authorization; Armatix denied that there were any problems. After a Maryland gun store announced that it would stock the product, the store’s owner faced protests and death threats. The backlash was linked, in part, to a New Jersey law that required all of the state’s gun dealers to switch their entire handgun inventory to smart guns after they became commercially available anywhere in the U.S. Retailers scrapped their plans to sell the Armatix weapon, which never became available for sale in U.S. gun stores, and the company later filed for bankruptcy.New Jersey eliminated its requirement for smart-gun-only inventories in 2019, after state lawmakers acknowledged the effort had unintentionally backfired. The state replaced it with a new requirement for all dealers to stock smart guns as an option for customers when they become available. Biofire has gone out of its way to avoid Armatix’s fate, joining with every major gun-rights group in opposing New Jersey’s new requirement, arguing that the choice should be up to individual retailers. The company has not submitted paperwork for its product to be evaluated by the state, as Biofire doesn’t want New Jersey gun shops to be required to sell its weapon. For now, all sales go through Biofire’s website. It remains to be seen whether there’s a broad market for Biofire’s product — or any smart gun. Kloepfer believes there’s a large appetite for a “home defense handgun” and wants to provide more affordable offerings over time. While noting Biofire’s steep price tag, KiOwana Phillips, an active-duty Army sergeant major who also runs a firearms training business in North Carolina, said she can see the appeal of biometric security features to help protect her 10-year-old at home.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., responded by saying that Russia and China “simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was penned by the United States.” She added that they would “rather see us fail than to see this council succeed even after inclusive consultations over weeks and weeks.”The U.S. resolution stated that a cease-fire is imperative for the protection of civilians and to expand the distribution of aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians facing the threat of famine. It had no direct link to the release of those taken captive during Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. But “toward that end,” it would unequivocally support diplomatic efforts “to secure such a cease-fire in connection with the release of all remaining hostages.”The vote came as the U.S. is increasingly pressuring its ally over the situation in Gaza, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Israel on Friday for fraught talks likely to center on humanitarian aid and Israel's insistence on a ground assault on the overcrowded city of Rafah. Ahead of the vote, Nate Evans, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the U.N., said in a statement that America had been “working in earnest with Council members over the last several weeks on a resolution that will unequivocally support ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at securing an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as part of a hostage deal.” Smoke rises during Israeli bombardment as people fleeing the Al-Shifa Hospital compound and its vicinity in Gaza City reach the central part of the Gaza Strip on Thursday.AFP - Getty ImagesIsrael says 130 hostages remain in Gaza, although 34 have died in captivity. The resolution marked a toughening of the U.S. stance toward Israel  in the war, which is nearing its sixth month. Washington, which traditionally protects Israel at the U.N., has vetoed three draft resolutions, two of which would have demanded an immediate cease-fire. Last month, it justified that veto by saying it could jeopardize talks about a truce. This was the fourth attempt to pass any kind of cease-fire resolution at the council. Thomas-Greenfield has vetoed three previous resolutions, in October, December and again last month.February's resolution tabled by Algeria received 13 votes of approval and one abstention from the United Kingdom. Russia and China were among those who criticized the U.S. for voting against the resolution for a third time.Friday's vote came after a report from the U.N.-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative warned that “famine is imminent” in northern Gaza and that escalation of the war could push half of Gaza’s total population to the brink of starvation.Dekel Lifschitz, the grandson of hostage Oded Lifschitz and released hostage Yocheved Lifschitz, walks through a memorial for Nova victims in Re'im, Israel, last month. Alexi Rosenfeld / Getty Images fileAfter it failed, French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country would work on a new resolution “with our American, European and Arab partners to reach an agreement.”Israel is facing mounting international pressure, even from some of its closest allies, to allow more aid into the enclave. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said Thursday that only an expansion of land crossings into Gaza could help prevent famine in the densely populated Palestinian enclave. Children are dying from the effects of malnutrition and disease, and from a lack of adequate water and sanitation, he said.And earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu engaged in a public diplomatic spat with President Joe Biden over his plans to launch a military offensive on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians are seeking shelter, many of them displaced by Israel's military campaign in the north of the enclave. The resolution also backed talks being brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar over a cease-fire and emphasized support for using the period of a truce to intensify efforts in pursuit of “lasting peace.” David Barnea, director of Israel's Mossad spy agency, was leading the Israeli delegations at the talks, Netanyahu's office said in a statement Thursday.   The vote came after Blinken held talks with  Netanyahu and his war Cabinet in Israel. Ahead of their meeting, Blinken said he would share alternatives to Israel’s planned ground assault into Rafah. Blinken also met with the leaders of Egypt and Saudi Arabia to discuss cease-fire efforts and ideas for Gaza’s post-conflict future.",[]

Gastrointestinal illnesses are often identified on cruise ships for a few reasons, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The ships' close living quarters make it easier for viruses to spread, and the regular addition of new passengers creates opportunities to introduce illness. However, because public health officials track illness cases on cruise ships, such outbreaks may also be reported more often than ones on land.Last month, an outbreak of norovirus — a common stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhea — sickened 92 passengers and eight crew members on a Celebrity Cruises ship.",[]

Some of these elections will be widely considered fair, such as those already held in Taiwan and Finland; others are likely to have a thumb on the scale, with leaders shackling opponents and the media, as in Rwanda. And the so-called votes in Russia, North Korea and elsewhere will be an outright sham.The pivotal centerpiece, even for many outside the United States, will be the anticipated contest between President Joe Biden and his presumed opponent, former President Donald Trump. Still baselessly rejecting his loss in 2020 and vowing to crack down on his opponents if he wins this year, Trump is a man many see as a threat to democracy, not only in America but also around the world.“This is a big stress test for democracy globally,” said Kelley E. Currie, who has held senior State Department roles, including under Trump, for whom she was the U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues. “The autocracies are linked up and working together,” she said, adding that “2024 will be an important inflection point for us.”Charles Parton, a British diplomat whose 40-year career has included postings in China, Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Libya, agrees. “Democracy is suffering from a virus; it is not well at present,” he said.This is not an overnight crisis but rather part of a yearslong process.Democracy has been on the slide since 2016, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London research group whose yearly ranking system has become a gold standard. Advances “made over the last 35 years have been wiped out” and democracy is now at its lowest ebb since 1986, a report last year by Sweden’s University of Gothenburg agreed.Of the 76 elections in 2024, just 43 will be free and fair, it said in a briefing last year.“There is a lot of reason to think that the net outcome of 2024 is going to be that we see fewer democratic practices and weaker democratic institutions in many parts of the world,” said Sarah Yi-Yun Shair-Rosenfield, a politics professor at England’s University of York.Arguably, the most pivotal race will come in the U.S.Era-defining threat?America’s democratic backsliding is not new.

The association started offering it in 2018 without incident. But a recent online advertisement inviting applications attracted a harsh response from Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, a self-proclaimed devout Catholic and former army commander.In a strongly worded statement Thursday night, Chiwenga claimed the scholarship was “a direct challenge” to the government’s authority.“Our schools and institutions of higher learning will not entertain applicants, let alone enroll persons associated with such alien, anti-life, un-African and un-Christian values which are being promoted and cultivated by, as well as practiced in decadent societies with whom we share no moral or cultural affinities,” he said.GALZ has previously said the scholarship seeks to provide equal access to state universities for LGBTQ people who are often ostracized by their families and struggle to pay for higher education. It did not comment on the vice president’s statement.However, a coalition of human rights groups that GALZ belongs to said it demonstrated that sexual and gender minorities are endangered in Zimbabwe.“We are extremely concerned about the statement from the second-highest office in the land because it exhibits intolerance, especially taking into account that the advertisement opens young people to so many opportunities,” Wilbert Mandinde, the programs coordinator at Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, told The Associated Press on Friday.Like many African countries, Zimbabwe has laws criminalizing homosexual activity. Sex between men carries a potential sentence of up to a year in prison, and the country’s constitution bans same-sex marriages.Chiwenga said Zimbabwe’s anti-gay laws make “any (scholarship) offers predicated on the same aberrations both unlawful and criminal, and a grave and gross affront on our national values and ethos as a Christian nation.”He said the government “will not hesitate to take appropriate measures to enforce national laws,” adding that young people “should never be tempted to trade or sell their souls for such abominable and devilish offers.”Zimbabwe has a history of discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people. Former President Robert Mugabe, who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years, once described them as “worse than dogs and pigs” and unworthy of legal rights.President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power following a 2017 coup led by Chiwenga when he was still an army general, has been less publicly vocal in his anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. But Chiwenga’s threat to ban the scholarship highlights the continued hostility from authorities and sections of society, including influential religious groups, remains.In December, Zimbabwe’s Catholic bishops, like many of their African counterparts, cautioned against the Pope Francis’ declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples, citing “respect of the law of the land, our culture and for moral reasons.”Zimbabwe has in the past stopped public acts that may appear to demonstrate approval of gay people.In 2021, a planned visit by a gay South African celebrity, Somizi Mhlongo, for the reopening of a trendy Zimbabwean restaurant was canceled after a Christian sect and members of the ruling ZANU-PF party’s youth wing vowed to block his appearance.",[]

Those laws have been used to prevent the British Museum from returning the Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles, to Greece.Some 17 items in total are involved in the loan arrangement, including 13 pieces of Asante royal regalia purchased by the V&A at auction in 1874. The items were acquired by the museums after they were looted by British troops during the Anglo-Asante wars of 1873-74 and 1895-96.“These objects are of cultural, historical and spiritual significance to the Asante people,’’ the museums said in a statement. “They are also indelibly linked to British colonial history in West Africa, with many of them looted from Kumasi during the Anglo-Asante wars of the 19th century.”The items covered by the loan agreement represent just a fraction of the Asante artifacts held by British museums and private collectors around the world. The British Museum alone says it has 239 items of Asante regalia in its collection.Nana Oforiatta Ayim, special adviser to Ghana’s culture minister, said the deal was a “starting point,” given British laws that prohibit the return of cultural artifacts. But ultimately the regalia should be returned to its rightful owners, she told the BBC.“I’ll give an analogy, if somebody came into your house and ransacked it and stole objects and then kept them in their house, and then a few years later said, ‘You know what, I’ll lend you your objects back,’ how would you feel about that?” she said.",[]

It will provide major relief to families and the country’s health system,” said Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer at the Gavi vaccines alliance, which is helping Cameroon secure the shots.The Central Africa nation hopes to vaccinate about 250,000 children this year and next year. Gavi said it is working with 20 other African countries to help them get the vaccine and that those countries will hopefully immunize more than 6 million children through 2025.In Africa, there are about 250 million cases of the parasitic disease each year, including 600,000 deaths, mostly in young children.Cameroon will use the first of two recently approved malaria vaccines, known as Mosquirix. The World Health Organization endorsed the vaccine two years ago, acknowledging that that even though it is imperfect, its use would still dramatically reduce severe infections and hospitalizations.The GlaxoSmithKline-produced shot is only about 30% effective, requires four doses and protection begins to fade after several months. The vaccine was tested in Africa and used in pilot programs in three countries.GSK has said it can only produce about 15 million doses of Mosquirix a year and some experts believe a second malaria vaccine developed by Oxford University and approved by WHO in October might be a more practical solution.

But it allowed priests to offer spontaneous, non-liturgical blessings to same-sex couples seeking God’s grace in their lives, provided such blessings aren’t confused with the rites and rituals of a wedding.In his statement, Ambongo said it wasn’t appropriate for African priests to offer such blessings because of the scandal and confusion it would create. He cited biblical teaching condemning homosexuality as an abomination and the African cultural context, where he asserted that LGBTQ unions “are seen as contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically corrupt.”“Within the church family of God in Africa, this declaration has caused a shockwave, it has sown misconceptions and unrest in the minds of many lay faithful, consecrated persons and even pastors, and has aroused strong reactions,” he wrote.While stressing that African bishops remain in communion with Francis, he said they believed such blessings cannot be carried out because “in our context, this would cause confusion and would be in direct contradiction to the cultural ethos of African communities.”A few weeks ago, Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye said “people of the same sex who marry in this country should be taken to a stadium to be pelted with stones, once discovered.” In a radio broadcast Dec. 29, he asked Burundians living abroad who practice homosexuality “not to return home.”Ambongo said the symposium statement was a “consolidated summary” of the positions adopted by individual national bishops conferences, and said it had received the “agreement” of Francis and the doctrine office’s new prefect, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández.The botched rollout of the Dec. 18 declaration has heightened conservative criticism of Fernández, whom Francis appointed to the office over the summer. Fernández apparently published the text with little consultation inside the Vatican and no forewarning to bishops in the rest of the world.Usually, when such sensitive Vatican documents are being prepared, there is an attempt to at least not blindside local church leaders. Often they are released with an accompanying letter or explanatory note published by Vatican Media, and are given to journalists ahead of time under an embargo to ensure the reporting is accurate and thought through.No such extra documentation or preparation accompanied Fiducia Supplicans, as the text is known, and its rollout was marked by individual bishops and entire national conferences voicing confusion and opposition.Others have welcomed it. France’s bishops conference, for example, said in a statement Wednesday that the declaration encourages pastors to “generously bless the people who come to them humbly asking for God’s help.”The document “reminds us that those who are not in a position to commit themselves to the sacrament of marriage are not excluded from the love of God or of his church,” the French bishops said.After its initial publication, Fernández was forced to issue a second explanatory note a few weeks later, insisting there was nothing “heretical” in the document but acknowledging the opposing views. He acknowledged that it may not be applicable to some parts of the world and that further “pastoral reflection” might be necessary.For more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",[]

A video posted on the social media platform X shows Kabuye on the ground writhing in pain with a deep wound to his right arm and a knife stuck in his belly.Kabuye said Thursday that he believes the attackers were trying not just to wound him, but to kill him, and that he fears his enemies might even target him in the hospital. “I don’t know who to trust right know,” he said.Kabuye is the executive director of the advocacy group Colored Voice Truth to LGBTQ. He had gone into exile in Kenya last March after receiving death threats following an attack on one of the members of the group, organization advocacy officer Hans Senfuma said. Kabuye had returned to Uganda on Dec. 15.In May, Uganda’s president signed into law anti-gay legislation supported by many in Uganda but widely condemned by rights activists and others abroad.The version of the legislation signed by President Yoweri Museveni doesn’t criminalize those who identify as LGBTQ — which had been a key concern for some rights campaigners. But the new law still prescribes the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality,” which is defined as sexual relations involving people infected with HIV, minors and other categories of vulnerable people.Kabuye had posted on X that he was deeply concerned about the consequences of Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Act 2023.“This law violates basic human rights and sets a dangerous precedent for discrimination and persecution against the LGBTQ+ community.

These countries account for around 10% of the world’s population but around 70% of its displaced persons, along with approximately 86% of global humanitarian need.The U.N. estimated in October that more than 114 million people were displaced by war and conflict worldwide. That figure is now likely higher.More from CNBCBaidu says its ChatGPT rival Ernie bot now has more than 100 million usersThis is 2023’s best-performing market in Asia — how will it fare in the new year?Russia’s Lavrov claims Ukraine’s Western allies are quietly changing strategy in bid to end conflictIRC President and CEO David Miliband said that for many of the people his organization serves, this is the “worst of times,” as exposure to climate risk, impunity in an ever-growing number of conflict zones and spiraling public debt collide with “diminishing international support.”“The headlines today are rightly dominated by the crisis in Gaza. There is good reason for that — it is currently the most dangerous place in the world to be a civilian,” Miliband said.“But the Watchlist is a vital reminder that other parts of the world are on fire as well, for structural reasons relating to conflict, climate and economy. We must be able to address more than one crisis at once.”Isabelle Arradon, research director at the International Crisis Group, told CNBC earlier this month that conflict fatalities globally are at their highest since 2000.“All the red flags are there, and on top of that, there is a shortage of means to resolve conflict. There’s a lot of geopolitical competition and less appetite for resolving these deadly conflicts,” she added.SudanNo. 1 on the IRC’s watchlist is Sudan, where fighting erupted in April 2023 between the country’s two military factions, and internationally brokered peace talks in Saudi Arabia yielded no solution.The conflict has now expanded into “large-scale urban warfare” that is garnering “minimal” international attention and poses a serious risk of regional spillover, the IRC said, with 25 million people in urgent humanitarian need and 6 million displaced.The Rapid Support Forces — led by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti) and allegedly supported by the UAE and Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar — has expanded a multipronged offensive from the conflict’s epicenter in the capital of Khartoum, leaving a trail of alleged atrocities in the western region of Darfur.The RSF reportedly pushed into central Sudan for the first time in recent days, prompting further mass exoduses of people from areas previously held by the Sudanese Armed Forces.The ICG’s Arradon told CNBC that alongside the ongoing risk of further mass atrocities in Darfur is the possibility of an “all-out ethnic conflict” that draws in more armed groups from the region.“Peace initiatives are very limited right now. Clearly, at the global level, there is a lot of distraction, and so the situation in Sudan is one where I don’t think there’s enough serious engagement right now at a high level for cease-fire negotiations, and so there needs to be a greater push,” she said.The flow of refugees into neighboring South Sudan and Ethiopia, themselves blighted by internal conflict, the effects of climate change and extreme economic hardship, amplifies the risks of spillover, analysts believe.Democratic Republic of the Congo, RwandaLast week’s chaotic election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo marked just the start of a new electoral cycle that will continue through 2024 against a brittle backdrop.Voting was marred by long delays at polling stations, with some failing to open all day and voting extended into Thursday in some areas of the massive mineral-rich country with 44 million registered voters.Several opposition candidates called for the election to be canceled, the latest controversy after a campaign blighted by violence as 18 candidates challenged incumbent President Félix Tshisekedi for the leadership.Partial preliminary results suggest Tshisekedi is well ahead in the vote, but the government on Tuesday banned protests against the election that were called for by five opposition candidates.The political turbulence comes amid ongoing armed conflict in eastern DRC and widespread poverty, and precedes further regional elections early next year.The likely prolonged contestation of the results, born out of long-held suspicions among Tshisekedi’s fragmented opposition about the independence of the electoral commission, could set off further conflict with implications for the wider region, crisis analysts believe.“We’re very concerned about the risk of a serious crisis. We saw in 2018 already how the contestation of the vote was a big problem, but now we have on top of that M23 [rebels], backed by Rwanda, that is increasing its fighting and coming very close to [the city of] Goma,” Arradon said.M23 rebels reappeared in the province of North Kivu in eastern DRC in November 2021, and have been accused by human rights groups of multiple apparent war crimes since late 2022 as they expand their offensive.Neighboring Rwanda has allegedly deployed troops to eastern Congo to provide direct military support to M23, stoking tensions between Kigali and Kinshasa, and prompting U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to repeatedly voice concern about the risk of a “direct confrontation.”The combination of a fractured and distrustful political backdrop, an ongoing armed rebellion and extreme socioeconomic pressures render the region fertile ground for conflict next year.Arradon described the situation in the DRC and other active and potential conflict zones around the world as “catastrophic.”“DRC, we’re talking about 6 million displaced. If you look at Myanmar, of course you’ve got this huge population in Bangladesh of displaced Rohingyas, and also displaced within Myanmar itself,” she said.“We’ve never seen so many people on the move globally, largely due to conflict. It’s not just people on the move, it’s the fact that often civilian populations live side by side with armed groups, and that’s the case in Myanmar, that’s the case in the east of DRC, also in Sudan, in the west and Darfur.”Members of the Mandalay People’s Defense Forces heading to the frontline on Dec. 10 amid clashes with the Myanmar military in northern Shan state.STR / AFP - Getty ImagesMyanmarThe civil war in Myanmar has been underway since a February 2021 military coup, and subsequent brutal crackdown on anti-coup protests, set off an escalation of long-running insurgencies from ethnic armed groups throughout the country.Government forces have been accused of indiscriminate bombing, and both the IRC and ICG fear the tactics may be ramped up in 2024 as ethnic armed groups and resistance forces have made significant gains in the north of the country.The military currently faces challenges from an alliance of three ethnic armed groups in northern Shan state, along with one of the country’s largest armed groups in the northwestern Sagaing region and smaller resistance forces in Kayah state, Rakhine state and along the Indian border in the west.“For first time in decades, military will have to fight numerous, determined and well-armed opponents simultaneously in multiple theatres; it may double down on brutal efforts to reverse tide on battlefield, including scorched-earth tactics and indiscriminate bombing in coming weeks,” the ICG’s latest CrisisWatch report assessed.The SahelCountries across the Sahel have experienced a series of military coups in the past couple of years, partly in response to heightened instability as governments struggle to tackle Islamist militant insurgencies spreading throughout the region.The Sahel encompasses north-central Africa’s semiarid belt between the Sahara Desert and savanna regions, and includes Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal.Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Chad have all endured coups and severe instability in the last three years. ICG’s Arradon said security issues had been deepened by the fallout from civil war in Libya to the north, which saw a deluge of weapons move south to supply armed groups in countries with large proportions of their populations in “peripheries that have felt neglected.”“So this overall security context of populations feeling neglected, plus easy access to weapons, has indeed created a growing security risk in the Sahel region, and the dissatisfaction from these populations has grown,” she added.... and many moreAlongside these, the ICG also has grave concerns about potential outbreaks of armed conflict in Haiti, Guatemala and Ethiopia, along with the well-documented risk of a Chinese incursion into Taiwan and its global geopolitical implications.",[]

That is a significant departure from previous flare-ups, where the virus mainly sickened people in contact with diseased animals.Mpox has been in parts of central and west Africa for decades, but it was not until 2022 that it was documented to spread via sex; most of the 91,00 people infected in approximately 100 countries that year were gay or bisexual men.In Africa, unwillingness to report symptoms could drive the outbreak underground, said Dimie Ogoina, an infectious diseases specialist at the Niger Delta University in Nigeria.WHO officials said they identified the first sexually transmitted cases of the more severe type of mpox in Congo last spring, shortly after a resident of Belgium who “identified himself as a man who has sexual relations with other men” arrived in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital. The U.N. health agency said five other people who had sexual contact with the man later became infected with mpox.“We have been underestimating the potential of sexual transmission of mpox in Africa for years,” said Ogoina, who with his colleagues, first reported in 2019 that mpox might be spreading via sex.Gaps in monitoring make it a challenge to estimate how many mpox cases are linked to sex, he said. Still, most cases of mpox in Nigeria involve people with no known contact with animals, he noted.In Congo, there have been about 13,350 suspected cases of mpox, including 607 deaths through the end of November with only about 10% of cases confirmed by laboratories. But how many infections were spread through sex isn’t clear. WHO said about 70% of cases are in children under 15.During a recent trip to Congo to assess the outbreak, WHO officials found there was “no awareness” among health workers that mpox could be spread sexually, resulting in missed cases.WHO said health authorities had confirmed sexual transmission of mpox “between male partners and simultaneously through heterosexual transmission” in different parts of the country.Mpox typically causes symptoms including a fever, skin rash, lesions and muscle soreness for up to one month. It is spread via close contact and most people recover without needing medical treatment.During the 2022 major international outbreak, mass vaccination programs were undertaken in some countries, including Canada, Britain and the U.S., and targeted those at highest risk — gay and bisexual men. But experts say that’s not likely to work in Africa for several reasons, including the stigma against gay communities.“I don’t think we’ll see the same clamoring for vaccines in Africa that we saw in the West last year,” said Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.She said that the gay and bisexual men most at risk of mpox might be fearful of coming forward in a broad immunization program. Countries should work on ways to give the shots —if available — in a way that wouldn’t stigmatize them, she said.Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyemba, general director of Congo’s National Institute of Biomedical Research, said two provinces in Congo had reported clusters of mpox spread through sex, a concerning development.There’s no licensed vaccine in Congo, and it would be hard to get enough shots for any large-scale program, Muyemba said. The country is trying to get a Japanese mpox vaccine, but regulatory issues are complicating the situation, he said.Globally, only one vaccine has been authorized against mpox, made by Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic. Supplies are very limited and even if they were available, they would have to be approved by the African countries using them or by WHO. To date, the vaccine has only been available in Congo through research.Oyewale Tomori, a Nigerian virus expert who sits on several WHO advisory boards, said African governments probably have too many competing priorities to ask the U.N. health agency or donors for help securing vaccines.“In Africa, mpox is most likely considered a low-priority nuisance,” Tomori said.He said stronger monitoring, laboratory networks and better availability of diagnostic supplies would be more helpful to the continent than vaccines.Without greater efforts to stop the outbreaks in Africa, Ogoina predicted that mpox would continue to infect new populations, warning that the disease could also spark outbreaks in other countries, similar to the global emergency WHO declared last year.“When the HIV pandemic started, it was among gay and bisexual men in the global north, and Africa thought it was not our problem,” he said. “Before we knew it, it came to Africa, but we still thought heterosexual populations would be protected.”Women of reproductive age now account for more than 60% of new HIV infections in Africa.“I worry the same thing will now happen with mpox,” he said. “Unless we address these outbreaks in Africa, this virus will keep coming back.”",[]

The International Fund for Animal Welfare has described it as a crisis for elephants and other animals.“El Nino is making an already dire situation worse,” said Tinashe Farawo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority.El Nino is a natural and recurring weather phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific, affecting weather patterns around the world. While this year’s El Nino brought deadly floods to East Africa recently, it is expected to cause below-average rainfall across southern Africa.That has already been felt in Zimbabwe, where the rainy season began weeks later than usual. While some rain has now fallen, the forecasts are generally for a dry, hot summer ahead.Studies indicate that climate change may be making El Ninos stronger, leading to more extreme consequences.Authorities fear a repeat of 2019, when more than 200 elephants in Hwange died in a severe drought.“This phenomenon is recurring,” said Phillip Kuvawoga, a landscape program director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which raised the alarm for Hwange’s elephants in a report this month.Parks agency spokesperson Farawo posted a video on social media site X, formerly Twitter, showing a young elephant struggling for its life after becoming stuck in mud in a water hole that had partly dried up in Hwange.“The most affected elephants are the young, elderly and sick that can’t travel long distances to find water,” Farawo said. He said an average-sized elephant needs a daily water intake of about 200 liters (52 gallons).Park rangers remove the tusks from dead elephants where they can for safekeeping and so the carcasses don’t attract poachers.Hwange is home to around 45,000 elephants along with more than 100 other mammal species and 400 bird species.Zimbabwe’s rainy season once started reliably in October and ran through to March. It has become erratic in recent years and conservationists have noticed longer, more severe dry spells.“Our region will have significantly less rainfall, so the dry spell could return soon because of El Nino,” said Trevor Lane, director of The Bhejane Trust, a conservation group which assists Zimbabwe’s parks agency.He said his organization has been pumping 1.5 million liters of water into Hwange’s waterholes daily from over 50 boreholes it manages in partnership with the parks agency. The 14,500-square-kilometer (5,600-square-mile) park, which doesn’t have a major river flowing through it, has just over 100 solar-powered boreholes that pump water for the animals.Saving elephants is not just for the animals’ sake, conservationists say. They are a key ally in fighting climate change through the ecosystem by dispersing vegetation over long distances through dung that contains plant seeds, enabling forests to spread, regenerate and flourish. Trees suck planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.“They perform a far bigger role than humans in reforestation,” Lane said. “That is one of the reasons we fight to keep elephants alive.”",[]

Let them run with their propaganda. It won’t negatively alter Uganda’s record on the ground.”The government has previously said the AHA is meant to criminalize same-sex activity and its promotion, not penalize LGBTQ Ugandans.LGBTQ rights activists, private individuals and a lawmaker are seeking to overturn the law on constitutional grounds.Three members of Uganda’s LGBTQ community shared the following stories about their experiences since the law was enacted. Reuters has referred to them by their first names or nicknames for safety reasons.Jobless and homelessDays after the law was enacted in May, Sandra, who is lesbian, was summoned to her boss’ office at the supermarket where she worked.“My boss ... told me, I can’t allow you to work for me anymore because of what is going on,” Sandra, 23, recalled. He told her that if customers learned he was “hiring someone like you” it would ruin the company’s reputation, she said.Sandra, who said her parents ordered her to leave their house when they learned about her sexual orientation in 2019, could not afford her rent and was evicted from her house. She found a place to sleep at a shelter for homeless LGBTQ Ugandans.She now works as an emergency responder at a different charity that helps LGBTQ people. When not at work, she said she keeps indoors and avoids social media to avoid drawing attention to herself.Nowhere to turnWhen his family learned he was gay in 2019, Pingu, now 22 years old, said his mother disowned him and stopped paying his school fees. His relatives threatened to burn his genitals with boiled water, he told Reuters.Still, as lawmakers began considering the AHA in March, fueling a surge in homophobic abuse, Pingu life’s was about to take a turn for the worse.In May, Pingu said he was drugged, raped and robbed by a man he had met at a restaurant for a date. Upon regaining consciousness he said he found himself half-naked on the roadside in a forested area. A good Samaritan helped him find his way home, he said.Pingu said the assault left him bruised around his genitals and struggling to walk, but he did not seek medical help or go to the police for fear it could land him in jail.“With all that homophobia that was going on ... I felt like they (health workers) would really ask me a lot of questions, they would report me to police,” he said. “I couldn’t get justice for what had happened to me.”'Suffocated by the world'When the law passed, Laura said her siblings and aunties told her people like her deserved the death penalty.That pushed the 22-year-old over the edge, and she pondered ways to kill herself. She said she started overdosing on anti-depressants and didn’t want to wake up at all. She also mulled hanging herself or drowning in a village well.Laura said she was admitted to a hospital, where she was stabilised and discharged.“What (the law) does to people like me, it makes you feel like you’re suffocated by the world to the point whereby you have no air to breath,” she said.“It makes you feel like you’re going to be in this world of people who hate you, so why don’t you just leave this world and leave it for those who hate you.”",[]

Blinken’s statements did not name any official.Uganda’s anti-LGBTQ law, considered one of the harshest in the world, was enacted in May and carries the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality,” an offense that includes transmitting HIV through gay sex.In June, the U.S. State Department imposed visa restrictions on Ugandan officials after the passage of the law. The State Department also previously put visa restrictions on Ugandan officials following the country’s 2021 elections, which it called “flawed.”“Today, I am announcing the expansion of the visa restriction policy to include current or former Ugandan officials or others who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the democratic process in Uganda or for policies or actions aimed at repressing members of marginalized or vulnerable populations,” Blinken said on Monday.“These groups include, but are not limited to, environmental activists, human rights defenders, journalists, LGBTQI+ persons, and civil society organizers.”Blinken also announced a new visa restriction policy for those he said were undermining democracy in Zimbabwe.Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa won a second term in a disputed vote in August, which the opposition described as a “gigantic fraud” amid criticism from election observers who say the election failed to meet regional and international standards.“Anyone who undermines the democratic process in Zimbabwe — including in the lead-up to, during, and following Zimbabwe’s August 2023 elections — may be found ineligible for U.S. visas under this policy,” Blinken said.",[]

But in other regions like eastern Europe and north Africa, infections are on the rise.“We are saying it can be achieved. That’s not the same as saying it will be achieved,” she said.Globally, there were 39 million people living with AIDS in 2022, including 1.3 million who were newly infected. Almost 30 million of them are getting treatment, but there were still 630,000 deaths due to AIDS-related illnesses last year, according to UNAIDS data.The new report calls for the work of community organizations to be recognized and funded to help fight stigma and the wider backlash, under the title “Let communities lead.”Byanyima said there were also other challenges, such as funding and “big battles” with pharmaceutical companies to ensure that new products can be made available in low-income countries at an affordable price.",[]

Tania Koen, a lawyer who has represented the Steenkamps throughout the parole process and Pistorius’ appeals, confirmed to NBC News that parole was granted.South Africa’s Correctional Services Department said in a statement that the parole board had made its decision after assessing Pistorius’ profile and deciding that he had a “positive support system.” He may be subject to rehabilitation programs aimed at reintegrating him with society, the statement said.Pistorius during his murder trial at the high court in Pretoria.Mike Hutchings / AFP via Getty Images filePistorius had been denied parole at a hearing in March after a judge ruled that, despite expectations that parole would be granted, he had not served the minimum time needed to qualify. The judge in that hearing said he wouldn’t be considered for parole until August 2024.The 2014 trial attracted global attention as the details of Steenkamp’s death were beamed around the world. It immediately ended the career of Pistorius, then perhaps the world’s most high-profile disabled athlete, who made history by competing in an able-bodied field at the Olympics.Pistorius claimed he mistook Steenkamp for a burglar and shot her in error. As a condition of the parole process, Pistorius met with Steenkamp’s father, Barry, in June 2022. Her family opposed his release because they reject Pistorius’ account of their daughter’s killing.Steenkamp’s mother, June Steenkamp, said in a victim impact statement released by the court that she still did not believe Pistorius’ explanation.“My dearest child screamed for her life; loud enough for the neighbors to hear her. I do not know what gave rise to his choice to shoot through a closed door at somebody with hollow-point ammunition when I believe, he knew it was Reeva,” she wrote.June Steenkamp added that she was not attending the parole hearing Friday, as “I simply cannot muster the energy to face him again at this stage,” adding that she does not consider Pistorius to be rehabilitated.Barry Steenkamp, Reeva’s father, died in September this year after suffering a stroke.“My dear Barry left this world utterly devastated by the thought that he had failed to protect his daughter and therefore in his role as father, as he perceived it,” Steenkamp wrote.As Pistorius has not yet served his full sentence of 13 years and five months, he will likely be forced to wear an electronic security tag and be banned from leaving Gauteng Province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria.The Correctional Services Department's statement only said Pistorius would be “subjected to supervision in compliance with parole conditions until his sentence expires.”Originally, Pistorius was sentenced to six years in jail for murder, but prosecutors then appealed what they called a “shockingly lenient” punishment and the sentence was increased.Born with a congenital condition that led to both his legs being amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old, Pistorius became a successful athlete, leading out the South African team at the 2012 London Olympics’ opening ceremony. Days later he would become the first double amputee to compete at the Olympics.Those watching the 2014 trial heard that Pistorius had a gun with him “all the time,” including on his bedside table while he slept. He told the court that he lived in fear of a home invasion and said he had been followed, shot at and hijacked. When he shot Steenkamp, he had assumed it was a burglar, he said.In the victim impact statement, June Steenkamp said that while Reeva may not have had a chance to follow her dreams, she leaves a rich legacy.“It has taken me 10 years to realize that Reeva appeared to have fulfilled her destiny during her life and more abundantly so in her tragic death,” she wrote.“Reeva’s name and her demise continue to raise awareness around gender-based violence worldwide.”",[]

The ball made from plastic bread wrappers frequently plunges into ponds of sewage. The children pick it out and continue their game.“Those boys are playing with fire,” she said. “We buried a boy from this area last week. He was playing soccer in the street just like these boys one day. He fell sick overnight and died at the hospital. They said it was cholera.”Since the start of the latest outbreak, Zimbabwe’s Health Ministry has recorded 8,087 suspected cholera cases and 1,241 laboratory-confirmed cases. It said there have been 152 suspected cholera deaths and 51 laboratory-confirmed deaths.The country of 15 million people has been recording more than 500 cases a week since late October, the highest rate since February, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The group made an emergency appeal this month.Cholera is a water-borne disease caused by ingesting contaminated food or water and can kill within hours if left untreated, yet it is usually easily treated by rehydrating patients if cases are caught in time.The World Health Organization has said that cholera cases in Africa are rising exponentially amid a global surge. The African continent accounted for 21% of cases and 80% of deaths across the globe from 2014 to 2021, according to the WHO.The outbreak in Zimbabwe is spreading from urban to rural areas and putting at risk over 10 million people, including more than 5 million children, said the Red Cross Federation. It said major causes were poor hygiene, but also a lack of awareness and religious practices that include self-proclaimed prophets ordering sect members to rely on prayer and items such as holy water rather than seek medical treatment.Cholera is now in all of the country’s 10 provinces, Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora said at a clinic in the hotspot township of Kuwadzana in Harare this weekend. At Kuwadzana Polyclinic, cholera patients lined up in a special tent set up for them and were given a cup of rehydrating sugar and salt solution on arrival.“We have had a flare-up in urban areas,” said Mombeshora, adding that seven of the 13 people who have died in Harare are from Kuwadzana. “We are approaching the rainy season and the conditions cause a scare for us. We have to take it as an emergency.”The conditions in areas like Kuwadzana and neighboring Glen View make them fertile ground for infections.At shopping centers bustling with activity, flies crawl over heaps of uncollected trash. Raw sewage from burst pipes flows in streets and sometimes in the yards of homes. Many people have dug trenches to direct the flow away from their houses.Long-running local government failures see many residents go for months without tap water, forcing them to dig shallow wells and boreholes that have also been contaminated by sewage.Joyleen Nyachuru, a water, sanitation and hygiene officer with the Community Water Alliance non-governmental organization, and also a resident of the Glen View township, said she fears a repeat of 2008 when more than 4,000 people died in Zimbabwe’s worst outbreak.“Some don’t even know the signs and symptoms of cholera, so people are just falling sick in their houses without knowing what exactly is happening to them. It’s terrifying,” said Nyachuru, who recently delivered a petition to council offices signed by dozens of residents demanding safe drinking water and an end to the dire, unhygienic conditions.In Glen View, Mangosho is living in daily fear. She lets her grandson out for only a short while to play while watching him closely.“The whole neighborhood has children who are sick. Some, including adults, are dying,” she said. “We are afraid.”",[]

It was fiercely criticized by international human rights groups and domestic opponents.Rwanda received an initial £140 million ($174 million) last year to receive migrants who made the 4,000-mile trip — although none have been sent yet. Wednesday's ruling cast doubt that would happen.""This was not the outcome we wanted, but we have spent the last few months planning for all eventualities and we remain completely committed to stopping the boats,"" Sunak said in a statement.A group of five unnamed migrants — three from Syria, one from Iran and one from Iraq —  challenged the legality of the plan in an appeal and argued that Rwanda does not count as a ""safe country.""The five Supreme Court judges said there was ""a real risk that persons sent to Rwanda would be returned to their home countries where they face persecution or other inhumane treatment when, in fact, they have a good claim for asylum.""A lower court previously ruled that the policy was legal, Wednesday's ruling noted. ""However, the way in which the Home Secretary had implemented the policy in the claimants' individual cases was procedurally flawed,"" it said.Specifically, the policy was judged unlawful because the U.K. adheres to the European Convention on Human Rights, a charter that obligates states to ensure people are not subjected to torture and other abuses.A statement by Sunak later on Wednesday said the government was working on a legally binding treaty with Rwanda to address the court’s concerns. Should that fail, Sunak said he would consider changing U.K. law and leaving international human rights treaties to move forward with the plan.More than 20,000 people have the made the crossing this year, according to official figures, including 800 on one day. This is still less than in 2022, when more than 45,000 made the trip. But the influx is still putting strain on some local authorities in the U.K., which during a national housing crisis are putting some migrants in hotels and student accommodations.Then Home Secretary Suella Braverman views houses being built in Rwanda that could eventually house deported migrants from the U.K.Stefan Rousseau  / PA via Getty ImagesThe Rwanda plan was the brainchild of the former interior minister Suella Braverman, who was fired Monday by Sunak after she accused police of bias toward pro-Palestinian demonstrators she described as ""hate marchers.""Braverman released a scathing resignation letter Tuesday, attacking Sunak for abandoning or ignoring right-wing projects he had allegedly agreed to uphold and for not having a ""plan B"" should the Supreme Court reject the Rwanda plan.The plan has been strongly criticized by opposition lawmakers, human rights groups, migrant welfare charities and lawyers but right-wing lawmakers and supportive newspapers continue to argue that the plan is the key to stopping the boats, which are linked to extensive organized crime groups.Braverman and her allies continue to argue that Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights, which was created after World War II, inspired by Winston Churchill and drafted by a British Conservative barrister.",[]

Three of those who fled said they had witnessed killings by Arab militias and RSF forces targeting the Masalit ethnic group in Ardamata, an outlying district in El Geneina that is home to the army base and to a camp for internally displaced people (IDP).The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was not able to independently verify the accounts of what took place.Reuters has reported that between April and June this year, the RSF and allied Arab militias conducted weeks of systematic attacks targeting the Masalit, El Geneina’s majority ethnic African tribe, as war flared in the country between the RSF and Sudan’s army.In public comments, Arab tribal leaders have denied engaging in ethnic cleansing in El Geneina, and the RSF has said it was not involved in what it described as a tribal conflict.At talks in Jeddah, the warring parties agreed to facilitating aid deliveries and confidence-building measures, mediators said on Tuesday, but efforts to secure a ceasefire have so far failed.A family crosses the border from Sudan to Chad on Tuesday.El Tayeb Siddig / ReutersThe attack on the army base in Ardamata started early last week, when militiamen also started shelling homes in the IDP camp, said Nabil Meccia, a nurse who said he had crossed into Chad after being detained by the RSF at the border and paying to secure his release.He said he had seen RSF forces killing civilians as they sprayed gunfire during raids in the Ardamata camp, and lining men up and executing them. Like others, Meccia had moved to Ardamata, where residents hoped for protection by the army, after the attacks elsewhere in El Geneina this year.An army soldier who declined to be named, who fled the Ardamata base, said a drone attack early on Friday had destroyed its defences and that military commanders had left by Saturday morning.As army troops pulled out of their base, community leaders in Ardamata collected weapons to try to secure safe passage for civilians, said Meccia and Sharaf Eddin Adam, another civilian refugee who arrived in Chad.Residents with access to vehicles managed to escape, but others were arrested or forced to labour by the RSF before several dozen were lined up and executed in Ardamata’s Kobri district just after midday on Sunday, Adam said.He said he saw dozens of bodies of civilians lying lifeless in the street and that people were also beaten and flogged.The war in Sudan has caused a major humanitarian crisis and the displacement of more than 6 million people, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). More than 500,000 people have crossed into Chad, mostly from West Darfur, the IOM says.Medical charity MSF said the number of refugees arriving in Chad had sharply increased in the first three days of November to 7,000. The refugees were mainly women and children, and many recounted stories of large-scale violence against civilians, it said.U.N. officials in Chad said thousands more were expected to cross but had been prevented from doing so by RSF forces demanding money.Relatives missingAnother witness, Mashaar Omar Ahmed, said militia and RSF forces, some in plain clothes and some in uniform, had executed more than 30 men in Ardamata’s District B after separating them from the women.“They asked the men if they were Masalit, and they didn’t deny it,” she said, carrying her 6-month-old daughter.

I feel like I’m at home,” Swali said, after the nearly 4-mile march through some of Johannesburg’s wealthiest neighborhoods beneath purple flowering jacaranda trees.Uganda introduced one of the world’s harshest anti-gay laws in May, including the death penalty for ""aggravated homosexuality."" Same-sex relations were already illegal in Uganda, as they are in more than 30 African countries.South Africa, in contrast, made same sex marriage legal in 2006 and is still the only African country to have done so.“Our intention today is to march for Uganda ... for LGBT communities in Africa that can’t march for themselves,” said Johannesburg Pride organizer Kaye Ally.Last year’s Pride, the city’s first since the Covid-19 pandemic, was subdued after the U.S. warned of a possible terrorist attack beforehand. That only increased the LGBTQ community’s desire for this year’s event, held 34 years after the first, said Ally.“This year we’re going full force,” she said. “That hunger for Pride, as well as all the happenings in Africa, has really amplified the need for us to take to the streets and to come out in all our flamboyancy and assert our authenticity.”",[]

She said concerns highlighted by the organization in a 2016 report — about the abuse and stigma that gay people face in Nigeria — have remained.Nigeria’s Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act of 2013, which has been condemned internationally but is supported by many in the country of more than 210 million people, punishes gay marriage with up to 14 years in prison and has forced many Nigerian gays to flee the country, according to human rights activists.Arrests under the law have been common since it came into effect but the largest mass detentions yet have been in recent weeks in which some of the suspects were falsely accused and subjected to inhumane conditions, according to lawyers and rights groups.After dozens were arrested at what the police called a gay wedding in a Delta state hotel, the suspects were paraded in front of cameras in a live social media broadcast despite a ruling by a Nigerian high court last year that pretrial media parades violate the nation’s constitution.One of those paraded said he was at the hotel for another engagement. Another suspect said he does not identify as a gay individual and was arrested while on his way to a fashion show.In Gombe, where the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) said its personnel arrested people who “intended” to organize a gay wedding, the prime suspect identified as Bashir Sani denied the allegation.“There was no wedding, only birthday,” he said in a broadcast aired by local media.Among those arrested were the photographer and the disc jockey at the event, Ochuko Ohimor, the suspects’ lawyer, told The Associated Press.It is part of a trend that shows how the anti-gay law is being “exploited” without due process, said Okechukwu Nwanguma, who leads the Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre, which advocates for police reforms in Nigeria.One evidence of such a flawed process, lawyers said, is the failed trial of the 47 men arrested in 2018 and charged with public displays of affection for members of same sex at a hotel in Lagos. A local court dismissed the case in 2020 because of what it described as the “lack of diligent prosecution” after the police failed to present some witnesses.“They (law enforcement authorities) are exploiting the law to target people whether or not they are queer … There is a tendency to target them based on assumptions or allegations, not based on any investigation,” said Nwanguma.Such blanket arrests and media parade are not only discriminatory but also pose a high risk of further endangering people for their real or perceived sexual or gender orientation, said Amnesty International’s Sanusi.“Since the signing of Same Sex Prohibition Act into law in 2014 attacks, harassment, blackmail and extortion of the LGBTQ+ community is rising, at disturbing speed. The Nigeria Police should be prioritizing keeping everyone safe, not stoking more discrimination,” he said.Police spokespersons at the Nigeria Police Force headquarters and at the Delta state command did not respond to enquiries from the AP to speak on the arrests and on the allegations about the lack of due process in handling such cases.Lawyers also spoke to the AP about instances where the police failed to act in handling cases of abuse against the LGBTQ community in Nigeria.In 2020, David Bakare, a gay person, petitioned the police about a group of men who beat him up after he shared a video of himself dancing. The suspects were freed on bail after which they continued to threaten Bakare to withdraw the petition, a copy of which his lawyer shared with The AP.Bakare then petitioned the police a second time to alert them that his life is in danger but no action was taken in response, he said. He had no choice but to flee to another part of Lagos.“Since you can’t trust the police to do the necessary things, those guys will come again,” the 26-year-old said of his abusers.The problem of delayed justice is not new in Nigeria where the criminal justice system has been criticized as corrupt. But it is far worse for groups such as the LGBTQ community seen to be vulnerable, said Chizelu Emejulu, an activist and lawyer who has handled many cases involving queer people.“When we get the perpetrators arrested, the consistent thing we have noticed is that people always claim their victims are queer and once they say that, the police begin to withdraw from these cases,” said Emejulu.“What the LGBTQ community in Nigeria is asking for is to be left alone to live their lives,” Emejulu added.",[]

The accused are out on bail.In Nigeria, like in most parts of Africa, homosexuality is generally viewed as unacceptable, and a 2014 anti-gay law took effect despite international condemnation.Buhari Saad, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) spokesperson for the largely Muslim Gombe state, said after receiving a tip off, the agency raided a party on Saturday night that was being attended by “homosexuals and pimps.”He said 59 men had been arrested, including 21 who confessed to being homosexual, and 17 women.The Gombe NSCDC said in a statement that the organizer of the birthday party had also planned to wed another man, who was still at large, before police raided the event.The anti-gay law in Africa’s most populous nation includes a prison term of up to 14 years for those convicted, and bans gay marriage, same-sex relationships, and membership of gay rights groups.The case was expected to be heard in the Gombe state High Court on Tuesday, Saad said.",[]

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., was hit with new charges Thursday accusing him of accepting bribes from a foreign government and conspiring to act as a foreign agent, according to a superseding indictment.The new indictment, filed by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, alleged that he “provided sensitive U.S. Government information and took other steps that secretly aided the Government of Egypt.”Menendez could face up to two years in prison for failing as a public official to register as an agent of a foreign power, according to a law cited in the superseding indictment.In a statement Thursday, Menendez dismissed the new allegations.""The government’s latest charge flies in the face of my long record of standing up for human rights and democracy in Egypt and in challenging leaders of that country, including President [Abdel-Fattah] El-Sisi on these issues,"" he said.""Piling new charge upon new charge does not make the allegations true. The facts haven’t changed, only a new charge,"" he added. ""I again ask people who know me and my record to give me the chance to present my defense and show my innocence.""Menendez and his wife, Nadine, last month pleaded not guilty to corruption charges alleging that they used his influence to pocket hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.Three other defendants — New Jersey businessmen Jose Uribe, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana — also pleaded not guilty to the corruption charges last month.Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who was the first Senate Democrat to call for Menendez to resign after the initial criminal charges, said Thursday that senators should hold a vote to expel him.""We cannot have an alleged foreign agent in the United States Senate,"" Fetterman said in a statement. “It is time for every one of my colleagues in the Senate to join me in expelling Senator Menendez.""Expulsion would require two-thirds of the full Senate to vote in favor of removing Menendez.Fetterman's call was backed by Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who announced after last month's charges that he was running for Menendez's seat. ""Given the severity of these charges, the US Senate should vote on expulsion,” Kim wrote on X.In the indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors alleged that Menendez's wife and Hana “worked to introduce Egyptian intelligence and military officials to Menendez for the purpose of establishing and solidifying a corrupt agreement.”The new charge alleges that from 2018 to 2022, Hana, Menendez and his wife ""conspired, confederated and agreed together and with each other to have a public official"" — Menendez — ""act as an agent of a foreign principal, to wit, the Government of Egypt and Egyptian officials.""It cites as overt acts a dinner Menendez, his now-wife and Hana had together at a restaurant in 2018 and a second dinner Menendez had with Hana and an unidentified Egyptian official in 2019.Hana's lawyer, Larry Lustberg, mocked the charge in a statement Thursday.“The new allegation that Wael Hana was part of a plot concocted over dinner to enlist Senator Menendez as an agent of the Egyptian Government is as absurd as it is false. As with the other charges in this indictment, Mr. Hana will vigorously defend against this baseless allegation,"" Lustberg said.An alleged meeting in Menendez’s office with his wife;, Hana, an Egyptian military official and other officials during which the discussion involved foreign military financing to Egypt, among other topics, the indictment says. USDC Southern District of NYWhile additional details about Menendez’s alleged conduct on behalf of the government of Egypt are included in Thursday’s filing, prosecutors did not allege that the senator or his wife accepted any additional cash or gifts that weren’t already included in the charges issued last month.The superseding indictment noted that Menendez had sent two letters to the Justice Department in May 2022, including one letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking that they request an unnamed former member of Congress to be investigated as a foreign agent.Prosecutors said the letters, which were posted on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee website and/or Menendez’s website, included the specific statutes that prohibit Americans from working on behalf of a foreign government without registering with the Justice Department.The indictment alleged that Menendez’s wife was the one who advised Hana that she was dating the senator and that allegedly happened when Hana’s outreach, in part to advance Egypt’s interests, began.An alleged meeting at a Washington, D.C., steakhouse during which Menendez; his wife; Hana; and “Egyptian Official-3” allegedly requested his assistance to counter the Agriculture Department’s objections to IS EG Halal’s monopoly (IS EH Halal is the company Hana owns). USDC Southern District of NYThe new charges against Menendez come weeks after he and his wife were accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in return for the use of his influence to enrich the three New Jersey businessmen and benefit the Egyptian government.During his time as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez helped oversee billions of dollars in U.S. aid to Egypt. He stepped down as chair of the panel shortly after he was indicted last month.The charges in the indictment from last month included conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. In that indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple received bribes, including in the form of “cash, gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low-or-no-show job, a luxury vehicle and other items of value.""In addition to the federal corruption case, the FBI is investigating whether Egypt’s intelligence services might have been involved in the alleged bribery scheme described in the September indictment of Menendez and his wife, sources familiar with the matter said last month.Menendez rejected calls for his resignation from dozens of his Democratic colleagues after he was indicted on bribery charges last month.Amid those calls, Menendez had met with his fellow Senate Democrats in a closed-door meeting. After the meeting, he told reporters: “I will continue to cast votes on behalf of the people of New Jersey as I have for 18 years. And I am sure when they need those votes, they’ll be looking for it, for me to catch those votes.”Menendez has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in the case and predicted that he would ultimately be exonerated. Nadine Menendez’s lawyer, David Schertler, said in a statement after the charges last month that she “denies any wrongdoing and will defend vigorously against these allegations in court.”In his first public comments on the charges, Menendez insisted all of the cash found in his Englewood Cliffs home was his.“For 30 years, I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account, which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba,” he said. “These were moneys drawn from my personal savings account based on the income I have lawfully derived over those 30 years.”The federal indictment was the second Menendez has faced since he entered office as a senator in 2006. He was charged in 2015 with illegally accepting favors from a Florida eye doctor. The case ended in a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict. Federal prosecutors decided against retrying him.Menendez is the first sitting U.S. senator to face indictments on two unrelated criminal allegations, according to data compiled by the Senate Historical Office.CORRECTION (Oct. 12, 2023, 9 p.m. ET): A photo caption in a previous version of this article misstated the state Menendez represents in the Senate.

Abdourahamane Tchiani. Prior to Bazoum’s ouster, U.S. troops trained Nigerien military special forces, supported them in planning for counterterror missions, and provided intelligence and remote support during Nigerien military operations.In the days following the takeover, the Pentagon suspended security cooperation between the U.S. military and Nigerien military, halted foreign military sales and paused some foreign assistance programs.On Aug. 5, the U.S. halted nearly $200 million in foreign assistance programs to Niger. Officially designating the change in government a coup could suspend hundreds of millions more in assistance, according to a senior U.S. administration official, though some humanitarian and health assistance would be likely to continue.A State Department spokesperson did not confirm any impending change. “We don’t have anything to announce. We are continuing to advocate for a diplomatic solution that preserves constitutional order and democracy in Niger.”A spokesperson for the National Security Council said the administration is continuing its ""diplomatic engagements to preserve civilian rule in Niger. We have also continued assessing our next steps, including making a formal 7008 determination. If we make a determination, we will announce, but at the moment, I have nothing to preview. I’d note that a formal 7008 determination has been something we have considered since the beginning, nothing new and nothing to announce today.”Bazoum and members of his family are still being held hostage in Niger, the administration officials said.ISIS on the attackThe coup has threatened to derail the U.S. effort to fight Islamist militants in Africa’s volatile Sahel region, where Niger has played a pivotal and reliable role as a partner and hub for counterterrorism efforts in the region. In recent years, Niger has also become a melting pot for various terror networks who have exploited coups and instability in neighboring countries and then crossed into Niger to prey on civilians and military along the borders.  Since the July 26 coup, U.S. officials warn there has already been an uptick in attacks by the Islamic State terrorist group along the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali, countries to Niger’s west that have both undergone coups in recent years, as well. The officials say the Nigerien military has been somewhat distracted since the coup and less focused on counterterrorism operations against ISIS, and that ISIS is exploiting that. While the U.S. military does not have concrete numbers, it estimates that dozens of members of the Nigerien military have been killed and wounded in ISIS attacks recently.Since the president’s overthrow, a group known as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has threatened to send troops to Niger to restore him to power. Even though U.S. officials say the ECOWAS nations have neither the troops available nor the will to fight in Niger, the threats have forced the Nigerien military to turn its attention to planning for an outside intervention rather than counterterror operations.“ISIS is taking advantage of the situation,” a U.S. defense official said.While ISIS has not been taking land in these attacks, it is trying to expand its reach into Niger and gain influence or power over local populations. The U.S. military believes there are currently fewer than 1,000 ISIS fighters inside Niger, but officials warn the numbers are very uncertain because of the vast parts of the country where the U.S. has no troops or intelligence gathering.The U.S. military is flying drones in Niger, primarily focused on areas where the US has troops or civilians, the officials said. Despite the coup, the U.S. still coordinates U.S. military movements with the Nigerien military for safety and security of U.S. troops.The Biden administration is still working through specifics about how the U.S. mission and footprint will change with a coup designation. The U.S. officials did not rule out possible U.S. unilateral counterterror missions into Niger in the future to target ISIS and other terror networks. After a coup determination, some U.S. troops and assets, like armed drones, could be moved elsewhere in the region to continue counterterror operations, the officials said, but declined to say where.",[]

The technology has been criticized by some climate scientists who argue that the technology is a dangerous distraction from the only viable solution to climate change: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning en masse away from fossil fuels. Others say that direct air capture is a necessary part of a diverse effort to limit global warming.“The world is going to need to decarbonize,” said Bilha Ndirangu, CEO of Great Carbon Valley. “There will be different investments and innovations in decarbonization efforts. How do we make sure that some of those investments are happening in Africa?”The case for investing in Africa is heightened by the disproportionate impacts of climate change, such as extreme drought and flooding, on African nations that have contributed little to the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Last month, discussions at the United Nations and the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi focused on how to attract more capital to the continent — the world’s youngest continent, with 70% of sub-Saharan Africa under the age of 30.Calls for investment in Africa are tempered by watchdogs who say foreign investment in the global South can be harmful if investors from the global North prioritize profit over the safety and rights of local populations.“There’s a real need for safeguards on where these projects are taking place,” said Ugbaad Kosar, the director of environmental justice at Carbon180, a climate nonprofit that advocates for equitable carbon removal. “And once that’s decided, it’s important to track how the resources, benefits and risks are being distributed among the companies and vulnerable populations.”More from NBC News'Gobsmackingly bananas' September of extreme warmth alarms climate scientists More than 2,000 species of amphibians are threatened by extinction Pope Francis calls out fossil fuel companies, says climate action is too slow Carbon removal companies such as Climeworks create units of carbon dioxide removed by their plants and companies can buy those units to offset their carbon emissions. With carbon removal, companies that continue to use fossil fuels can claim to be carbon-neutral because they purchased offsets created by some carbon removal plants. Climeworks said it only works with companies that plan to reduce emissions over time, using carbon removal as just one tool in that process.“All direct air capture does is help fossil fuel companies pretend they’re taking climate action while they continue to drill for oil,” Jonathan Foley, a climate scientist and founder of Project Drawdown, a nonprofit climate group, said. “Trading a few seconds of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions to give oil and gas companies a fig leaf is not a good bargain.”The plant, projected to be completed by 2028, will be built in the Great Rift Valley, an intercontinental depression rich in deep basalt formations that extends across Kenya from Tanzania and onward to Ethiopia.Ndirangu said that the project is an opportunity for Kenya to tackle the climate crisis while creating jobs and expanding the renewable energy grid.",[]

At least six people have been charged under it, including two accused of the capital offense of “aggravated homosexuality”.But the report, authored by a committee of the Convening for Equality (CFE) coalition, said the main perpetrators of human rights abuses against LGBTQ people this year — including torture, rape, arrest and eviction — were private individuals.It said this pointed to the way the law and the rampant homophobic rhetoric that preceeded its passage earlier in the year had radicalized the public against the LGBTQ community.For example, the report said mob-aided arrests had become increasingly common “because AHA has put LGBTIQ+ persons on the spot as persons of interest, and the public seems to be the custodians of enforcing the witch hunt.”Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, researchers documented 306 rights violations based on the victim’s sexual orientation and gender identity, with state actors the perpetrators in 25 of those cases.By contrast, reports by rights activists in 2020 and 2021 found that state actors were responsible for nearly 70% of the rights violations documented in those years.

The new era of cooperation, based on mutual respect and sovereignty is already underway,” it said in a statement.The announcement was a significant, if expected, blow to France’s policy in Africa, with French troops having had to pull out of neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso in recent years after coups there. France had stationed thousands of troops in the Sahel region at the request of African leaders to fight Islamic extremist groups.France has maintained some 1,500 troops in Niger since the July coup, and had repeatedly refused an order by the new junta for its ambassador to leave, saying that France didn’t recognize the coup leaders as legitimate.But tensions had mounted in recent weeks between France and Niger, a former French colony, and Macron said recently that French diplomats were surviving on military rations as they holed up in the embassy.Macron’s announcement came after the coup leaders issued a statement earlier Sunday that they were closing Niger’s airspace to French planes, commercial and military, so that the new leadership could “retake total control of its skies and its territory.″ The decision did not apply to other international aircraft.French Barkhane air force mechanics at the Niamey, Niger, base on June 5, 2021. APAli Sekou Ramadan, an aide to Niger’s deposed President Mohamed Bazoum, told The Associated Press that Bazoum requested that Macron withdraw the French ambassador, Sylvain Itte, “in order to reduce tension.”In an interview with the France-2 and TF1 television networks, Macron said he spoke to Bazoum on Sunday and told him that “France has decided to bring back its ambassador, and in the coming hours our ambassador and several diplomats will return to France.”He added, “And we will put an end to our military cooperation with the Niger authorities because they don’t want to fight against terrorism anymore.”He said the troops would be gradually pulled out, likely by the end of the year, in coordination with the coup leaders ‘’because we want it to take place peacefully.”He said France’s military presence was in response to a request from Niger’s government at the time. That military cooperation between France and Niger had been suspended since the coup, however. The junta leaders claimed Bazoum’s government wasn’t doing enough to protect the country from the insurgency.The junta is now under sanctions by Western and regional African powers.Insa Garba Saidou, a local activist who assists Niger’s new military rulers with their communications, said they would continue to monitor developments until the French ambassador leaves the country. He also demanded a clear deadline for the withdrawal of the French troops.“This announcement from the French president announces the victory of the people of Niger. However, we are going to take it with a lot of reservation because I no longer believe in Mr. Macron,” said Saidou.The junta in August gave the French ambassador 48 hours to leave. After the deadline expired without France recalling him, the coup leaders then revoked his diplomatic immunity.Crowds wave a flag bearing the logo of the Russian private military company Wagner as they protest outside a French air base in Niamey on Sept. 16.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of obstructing the West African nation’s full participation at the U.N.’s annual meeting of world leaders in order to appease France and its allies.Experts say that after repeated military interventions in its former colonies in recent decades, the era of France as Africa’s “gendarme” may finally be over, as the continent’s priorities shift.Andrew Lebovich, a research fellow with the Clingendael Institute, a think tank, said the decision marks both an acceptance of a “harsh reality for France in the region and may possibly put some limits on the U.S. deployments in Niger, though as we have seen, the U.S. and France have not followed exactly the same positionings in Niger.”Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Morocco-based think tank, said Niger will feel the loss of French support in its fight against violent extremist groups.“France has been a reliable partner providing support to its operations and Niger simply doesn’t have an alternative to fill this void by the French, at least in short and mid term,” Lyammouri said.Macron last year withdrew French troops from Mali following tensions with the ruling junta after a 2020 coup, and more recently from Burkina Faso, for similar reasons. Both African countries had asked for the French forces to leave.France also suspended military operations with Central African Republic, accusing its government of failing to stop a “massive” anti-French disinformation campaign.",[]

They discussed military issues, such as command centers and the activities of rebels who were fighting against the government, according to an FBI agent’s affidavit.When the official told Lemma last September that it was time for him to continue his support, the affidavit says, Lemma responded, “Roger that!”The State Department said in a statement that it learned that Lemma may have improperly removed classified information from its systems during an internal 60-day security review prompted by the April arrest of a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents on a social media platform.The department said it would continue to implement recommendations from that review to improve its protection of classified information.",[]

Bodies are regularly being found amid mangled cars, uprooted palm trees and bits of buildings at the Derna seafront.Residents and aid groups gathered the bodies of those who were washed out to sea when historic rain caused two dams to burst and sent millions of cubic meters of floodwater through the center of the city. “These figures are expected to rise as search-and-rescue crews work tirelessly to find survivors,” the United Nations’ Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said of the death toll as of 5 p.m. Saturday (11 a.m. ET).Entire neighborhoods have been swept away with rescuers still searching Sunday.Yousef Murad / APThe World Health Organization said 32 tons of health aid — enough to reach almost 250,000 people — also arrived Saturday, including essential medicines, trauma and emergency supplies, and medical equipment.“This is a disaster of epic proportions,” Dr. Ahmed Zouiten, a WHO representative in Libya, said in a statement.The aid package also includes body bags for safe and dignified burials of the dead amid fears of the authorities’ rushing to bury people in mass graves.“The bodies of people who have died following wounds sustained in a natural disaster or armed conflict almost never pose a health danger to communities,” the agency said in a separate statement last week, urging for properly documented burials and cremations.Health alarms were not limited to the dead bodies.“The National Center for Disease Control has already detected at least 55 children poisoned as a result of drinking polluted water in Derna,” said the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Nearly 300,000 children were at soaring risk of diarrhea, cholera, dehydration and malnutrition, according to UNICEF, with nearly every critical infrastructure having been wiped out in the affected areas.International aid groups and Libyans alike scrambled to get humanitarian aid delivered to the devastated areas over the weekend.Yousef Murad / AP“Children are among the most vulnerable and are at high risk of disease outbreaks, lack of safe drinking water, malnutrition, disruption in learning, and violence,” the agency said last week in a statement.Entire neighborhoods were swept away last week when Storm Daniel caused two dams to collapse, unleashing on what was a struggling coastal city of 90,000 caught in years of political turmoil.Experts have said the disaster, brought on by the deadly mix of torrential rain and poor management of the dams — or the complete lack of them — could have been prevented.A hydrologist had begun researching the dams protecting the port city about 17 years ago, and the threat the residents faced was well-known, he said.“When I gathered the data, I found a number of problems in the Derna valley: in the cracks present in the dams, the amount of rainfall and repeated floods,” Abdul Wanis Ashour told Reuters.“I found also a number of reports warning of a disaster taking place in the Derna valley basin if the dams were not maintained,” he said.The results of his study, which were published in an academic paper last year, “demonstrated that the study area has a high potential for flood risk,” calling for immediate steps to enforce regular maintenance and precautionary measures for residents. “Therefore, dams of Wadi Derna basin is needed periodic maintenance,” he wrote in the paper. His worst fear came true last week.According to state media, the flooding destroyed at least 891 buildings in Derna. The collapse of the two dams, which were built in the 1970s, will be investigated along with the local officials and previous governments, Libya’s general prosecutor said at a news conference late Friday.Ashour said: “There were warnings before that.

The ship is under U.S. sanctions for ties to a company that transported arms for Russia’s war on Ukraine.South Africa denied there was a government-approved deal to ship weapons to Russia from the country, which officially has taken a non-aligned stance on the Ukraine war. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a three-person panel led by a retired judge to oversee an inquiry into the matter.An executive summary of the panel’s report released Tuesday night stated that the ship offloaded military equipment but no weapons were loaded onto it. The panel also said that South African officials had no say in how the equipment ordered from the United Arab Emirates was shipped.Ramaphosa made the summary public but has said the full report would remain classified. “To reveal the details of the equipment offloaded would compromise important military operations and put our soldiers’ lives at risk,” he said.Brigety asserted during a May news conference that U.S. intelligence showed ammunition and weapons were put on the Lady R in South Africa and carried to Russia. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers subsequently asked the Biden administration to punish South Africa and questioned the country’s ability to receive trade benefits under a U.S. law, the African Growth and Opportunity Act.The secretary-general of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party, Fikile Mbalula, last month openly questioned why Brigety remained in the country after allegedly “lying” about South Africa supplying Russia with weapons.The panel’s findings elicited calls from several quarters, including the ANC-aligned South African Communist Party, for the ambassador to be expelled.“We appreciate the seriousness with which the panel of inquiry undertook to investigate irregularities surrounding the Lady R’s presence in South Africa in December 2022,” David S. Feldmann, a spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, said Wednesday. “The U.S. government shared certain information pertaining to the Lady R and its presence in South Africa in support of the investigation.”According to the inquiry report, the Russian ship was redirected to the Simon’s Town naval base after shipping agents at the Ngqura-Port Elizabeth port, where it intended to dock, refused to service the ship due to the U.S. sanctions.“This only became apparent as the ship was already approaching South African waters,” the panel found, adding that the ship was redirected “to rescue the situation.”The investigating panel accepted the nighttime work to offload the military equipment, saying it was loaded on pallets and would be visible to anybody within site of the Simon’s Town dock. The vessel switched off its identification transponder because it was being tracked by foreign intelligence agencies, the panel said, without naming those agencies.The panel also concluded that the U.S. sanctions were not binding on South Africa because United Nations had not endorsed them.",[]

It had been heavily active in Russia’s war in Ukraine, having provided thousands of troops fighting on the eastern front lines before the mutiny ended in their exile in Belarus.

Seven of the victims were children, the youngest a 1-year-old, according to an emergency services spokesperson.Another 43 people were injured in the blaze, which broke out at about 1 a.m. in the heart of Johannesburg’s central business district, Johannesburg Emergency Services Management spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said.Bodies lie covered in the street outside a building in Johannesburg on Thursday.Michele Spatari / AFP - Getty ImagesAbandoned and broken-down buildings in the area are common and often taken over by people desperately seeking some form of accommodation. City authorities refer to them as “hijacked buildings.”Mulaudzi said the death toll was likely to increase and more bodies were likely trapped inside the building.

There were “obstructions” everywhere that would have made it very difficult for residents to escape the deadly blaze and which hindered emergency crews trying to work through the site, according to Mulaudzi.Search teams found 64 bodies, and the chance of anyone being found alive hours after the fire broke out was “very slim,” he said.As many as 200 people may have been living in the building, witnesses said.A witness who didn’t give his name told television news channel eNCA that he lived in a building next door and heard people screaming for help and shouting “We’re dying in here” when the fire started.Mgcini Tshwaku, a local government official, said there were indications that people lit fires inside the building to keep warm in the winter cold. Officials are looking into the cause of the blaze.After the fire was extinguished, smoke seeped out of windows of the blackened building as daylight broke.

But she said more immediate inspiration likely came from a recent spate of coups in the Sahel, where military officers have shown that they can seize power without repercussions.Gabon’s coup leaders can also play to doubts about the electoral process, Africa, the analyst, said. The vote was not transparent and practically held behind closed doors, she said.Every vote held in Gabon since the country’s return to a multi-party system in 1990 has ended in violence. Clashes between government forces and protesters following the 2016 election killed four people, according to official figures. The opposition said the death toll was far higher.“Gabon’s electoral laws and framework do not ensure credible elections,” Freedom House said in its 2023 country assessment.The soldiers who claimed power Wednesday planned to “dissolve all institutions of the republic,” said a spokesman for the group. He said that Bongo’s “unpredictable, irresponsible governance” risked leading the country into chaos.Gabon is a member of the OPEC oil cartel, with a production of some 181,000 barrels of crude a day, but its over 2 million people face high unemployment and rising prices. Nearly 40% of Gabonese ages 15-24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank.Several French companies said they were suspending operations and moving to ensure the safety of their staff, and a man who answered the phone at the airport said flights were canceled Wednesday. The private intelligence firm Ambrey said all operations at the country’s main port in Libreville had been halted, with authorities refusing to grant permission for vessels to leave.A second statement by the coup leaders, who came from the gendarme, the republican guard and other elements of the security forces, said the president was under house arrest in his residence, surrounded by family and doctors. People around him have been arrested for “high betrayal of state institutions, massive embezzlement of public funds (and) international financial embezzlement” said the military, among other charges.There has been no word from the president.Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba.Ludovic Marin / AFP - Getty Images fileSeveral members of the Bongo family are under investigation in France, and some have been given preliminary charges of embezzlement, money laundering and other forms of corruption, according to French media reports.The coup attempt came about one month after mutinous soldiers in Niger seized power from the democratically elected government, and is the latest in a series of coups that have challenged governments with ties to France, the region’s former colonizer. Gabon’s coup, if successful would bring the number of coups in West and Central Africa to eight since 2020.Unlike Niger and two other West African countries run by military juntas, Gabon hasn’t been wracked by jihadi violence and had been seen as relatively stable.In his annual Independence Day speech Aug. 17, Bongo said “While our continent has been shaken in recent weeks by violent crises, rest assured that I will never allow you and our country Gabon to be hostages to attempts at destabilization. Never.”At a time when anti-France sentiment is spreading in many former colonies, the French-educated Bongo met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris in late June and shared photos of them shaking hands.The mutinous officers vowed to respect “Gabon’s commitments to the national and international community.”France has 400 soldiers in Gabon leading a regional military training operation. They’ve not changed their normal operations today, according to the French military.French government spokesperson, Olivier Veran, said Wednesday: “France condemns the military coup that is underway in Gabon and is closely monitoring developments in the country, and France reaffirms its wish that the outcome of the election, once known, be respected.”When asked about Gabon Wednesday, the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell said it would be discussed by EU ministers this week. Defense ministers from the 27-nation bloc are meeting in Spain on Wednesday, and foreign ministers on Thursday. Borrell will chair both meetings, and Niger will also be a focus.“If this is confirmed, it’s another military coup, which increases instability in the whole region,” he said.A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Wang Wenbin, said Wednesday that China was closely following Gabon’s situation and called on the parties to resolve the issue peacefully, keeping in mind the interests of the nation and its people.Bongo has served two terms since coming to power in 2009 after the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. Another group of mutinous soldiers attempted a coup in January 2019, while Bongo was in Morocco recovering from a stroke, but was quickly overpowered.Bongo faced an opposition coalition led by economics professor and former education minister Albert Ondo Ossa, whose surprise nomination came a week before the vote.Reached Wednesday, Ossa said he wasn’t ready to comment on the attempted coup and was waiting for the situation to evolve.After the vote, the Central African nation’s Communications Minister, Rodrigue Mboumba Bissawou, announced a nightly curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., and said internet access was being restricted indefinitely to quell disinformation and calls for violence.NetBlocks, an organization tracking internet access worldwide, said internet service saw a “partial restoration” in Gabon after the coup.",[]

He said that homosexuality “will never be tolerated” in the West African nation.Arrests of gay people are common in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, where the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act carries up to 10 years in jail for gay individuals. Accomplices also face 10 years in prison. Enacted in 2013, the law has been condemned locally and internationally though it is also supported by many in the country.Police in Delta stormed a hotel in Ekpan where the gay wedding was being held and initially arrested 200 people, Edafe told reporters. Later, 67 of them were detained after initial investigations, he said.He spoke at a police station where the suspects were being paraded.“The amazing part of it was that we saw two suspects, and there is a video recording where they were performing their wedding ceremony,” he said. “We are in Africa and we are in Nigeria. We cannot copy the Western world because we don’t have the same culture.”He reiterated that police officers in Nigeria “cannot fold their hands” and watch gay people openly express their orientation in the country.“This is not something that will be allowed in Nigeria,” he said, adding that the suspects will be charged in court at the end of the investigation.",[]

It was a small breakthrough for Israel’s government, whose hard-line policies toward the Palestinians have led to a cooling of its burgeoning ties with the Arab world.Cohen said they discussed the importance of preserving the heritage of Libya’s former Jewish community, including renovating synagogues and cemeteries. The talks also touched on possible Israeli assistance for humanitarian issues, agriculture and water management, according to Israel’s Foreign Ministry.Libyan Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush.Mahmud Turkia / AFP - Getty Images fileThe Libyan foreign ministry, meanwhile, sought to downplay the importance of the meeting as “unprepared"" and an unofficial meeting during a meeting with Italy’s foreign minister. It said in a statement that Mangoush’s encounter with Cohen didn’t include “any talks, agreements or consultations.”Israel’s foreign ministry did not respond to reporters’ questions early Monday, including whether Cohen’s announcement had been coordinated with Libya.Libya was plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The oil-rich country has been split between the Western-backed government in Tripoli and a rival administration in the country’s east. Each side has been backed by armed groups and foreign governments. Gadhafi was hostile to Israel and a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including radical militant groups opposed to peace with Israel.Sunday’s announcement of the meeting prompted scattered protests in Tripoli and other towns in western Libya. Protesters stormed the foreign ministry headquarters to condemn the meeting, while others attacked and burned a residence for the prime minister in Tripoli, according to local reports.In the town of Zawiya protesters burned the Israeli flag, while others held the Palestinian flag. There were also protests in the city of Misrata, a stronghold for Dbeibah, according to footage circulated on social media and verified by The Associated Press.Khalid al-Mishri, an Islamist politician who was the chair of the State Council, a Tripoli-based legislative body, condemned the meeting and called for the dismissal of Dbeibah’s government, which is close to the U.S. and the West.“This government has crossed all prohibited lines and must be brought down,” he wrote on the X platform, previously known as Twitter.The east-based House of Representatives also slammed the meeting as a “legal and moral crime.” It called for an emergency session Monday in the eastern city of Benghazi.In Israel, Yair Lapid, a former foreign minister and prime minister, criticized Cohen for going public with the sensitive meeting.“Countries of the world this morning are looking at the irresponsible leak of the meeting of the Israeli and Libyan foreign minister and asking themselves: is it possible to manage foreign relations with this country? Is it possible to trust this country?” Lapid said in a statement.",[]

That was likely the intention,” Mark Cancian, a retired colonel in the U.S. Marines and senior adviser at Washington-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told NBC News.Alongside Prigozhin, Wagner commander Dmitry Utkin — a shadowy figure with neo-Nazi tattoos known as the mercenary chief’s right-hand man — and logistics chief Valery Chekalov were also on board the plane when it went down Wednesday, according to Russian authorities.   “That makes it much easier for the Kremlin and Russia’s military leaders “to control what happens next,” Cancian said.‘Sad’ in the Central African RepublicFidele Gouandjika was, at least briefly, in mourning.An adviser to the leader of the Central African Republic shared a post on Facebook on Thursday tagging himself as “feeling sad” with a photo of him saluting, alongside an image of the wreckage of Prigozhin’s jet.He praised Wagner for “saving Central African democracy” with an intervention that Western diplomats told NBC News had left the country effectively controlled by the mercenary group.But President Faustin Archange Touadéra’s spokesman, Albert Mokpeme, said by phone Friday that Prigozhin’s possible death “doesn’t change anything for us.” His boss already deals directly with the Russian authorities, and that fruitful relationship was not about to be derailed, he said.A member of the Wagner Group pays tribute to Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin at a makeshift memorial in front of its office in Novosibirsk, on Thursday.Vladimir Nikolayev / AFP - Getty Images“You can call them Wagner or whatever you want, but it works,” said Mokpeme, speaking from the BRICS summit of developing nations in South Africa, where Russia and China have been working to expand the bloc’s reach as a counter to the United States.The Kremlin’s bid to extend Russian influence abroad has long had Wagner at its heart, making the group’s fate in Africa and beyond all the more crucial. Prigozhin and his mercenaries have supported strongmen on the continent and earned riches on the back of it, with the group accused of exploiting gold and diamond mines in some African countries in return for military support.  Wagner’s focus on Africa appeared as solid as ever before the plane crash, with Prigozhin appearing in a video in which he hinted that he was in Africa, conducting reconnaissance and “making Russia even greater on every continent.”Prigozhin visited Mali and CAR only days before his apparent death, meeting with government officials and looking for new opportunities, according to J. Peter Pham, the former U.S. envoy to the Sahel region of Africa and a longtime analyst of the region.“Having lost much in Russia ... it seems that Prigozhin was in Africa to look after and reassure not only his remaining clients — the Central African Republic regime of Faustin-Ange Touadéra, the RSF in Sudan, and the Malian junta — but also his mercenaries,” Pham said, referring to the Rapid Support Forces currently fighting Sudan’s military.Even with Prigozhin out of the picture, “the opportunities that he seized upon to both undermine Western geopolitical interests — and profit while doing so — remain intact,” Pham added.The Wall Street Journal first reported on Prigozhin’s recent visit to the region.Nathalia Dukhan, an investigator with The Sentry, a research and advocacy group that has tracked Wagner’s activities across the continent, said her organization obtained information indicating that in his recent trip to CAR, Prigozhin visited mining sites and “also sought to obtain new contracts to control the country’s vast borders as well as attract potential investors in multiple economic sectors, including oil.”The visit coincided with social media posts about the opening of an investment center at the Russian House, an organization registered in CAR and affiliated with the Wagner outfit, that is supposed to offer free business services to attract Russian investors, according to Dukhan. Prigozhin’s “apparent aim was to reassure Touadéra of Wagner’s commitment in CAR, to further scale up and accelerate profiteering activities, and lock in the Russia-CAR enterprise for the long term — In short, a 21st century-style colonization,” she said.NBC News could not independently confirm whether Prigozhin had looked to secure new contracts for border security operations or other commercial ventures.Russian President Vladimir Putin also acknowledged Prigozhin’s work in Africa during his eulogy for the mercenary chief Thursday, calling him a “talented businessman” who had “dealt with oil, gas, precious metals and gems.”  Former U.S. officials and analysts said they also did not expect a major change in Wagner’s presence in Africa and the Middle East, including in CAR, Mali, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Syria and Libya. The outfit’s security contracts, mining operations and smuggling schemes likely will continue, albeit under more pliant management, as the Kremlin has seen Wagner’s presence as a useful tool to boost Moscow’s influence, they said.Wagner’s operations in Africa have been lucrative and effective for Moscow, providing “a low cost investment for relatively high impact — a lot of rubble for the ruble,” said Paul Kolbe, a former CIA officer and now senior fellow at Harvard University’ Belfer Center. “The purpose, the main goals and main mechanisms that Russia had for Wagner and the capability remain the same,” said Kolbe, who served 25 years in the CIA with overseas assignments in the former Soviet Union, southern Africa and elsewhere.  “So they’ll figure out a way to do it.”Russia also appeared to signal it remains committed to Wagner’s role in Libya, with Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov paying a visit to the country Tuesday and meeting Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar. Flouting an international arms embargo, Wagner paramilitaries have armed and backed Haftar, whose faction has waged a campaign against the U.N.-recognized government in Tripoli.There was no indication Wagner’s operations would be scaled back in Libya, and though its leadership and activities might be reorganized, the effort will “have to obey the same logic, which is to have a semi-private company that will operate on a clandestine basis,” said Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank.Ukraine and BelarusBut it may not be an entirely smooth transition for the Kremlin.“The demise of Prigozhin would almost certainly have a deeply destabilizing effect on the Wagner Group,” British military intelligence said in its assessment Friday.   Prigozhin’s drive and extreme brutality permeated Wagner, the assessment said, and “are unlikely to be matched by any successor.”After Prigozhin’s short-lived mutiny against the country’s military leadership two months ago, it was already clear the Russian Defense Ministry had the intention of absorbing the mercenary force, allowing mutinous fighters to sign contracts with the regular military as part of a deal that also allowed Prigozhin and his fighters to go into exile in neighboring Belarus. Months of bad blood between the mercenaries and Moscow’s military leaders could mean that a lot of Wagner fighters would rather be commanded by anyone but Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov could be the man for the job. He said earlier this year he wanted to create his own mercenary force in the style of Wagner. Kadyrov lamented Prigozhin’s loss and “iron character” in a statement on Telegram on Thursday, one of the few top Russian officials to speak out after the crash, but called him out for putting personal interests ahead of “matters of paramount national importance.” Unlike Prigozhin, Kadyrov has maintained absolute loyalty to Putin.There are also questions about the fate of Wagner fighters who went into exile in Belarus, where their presence close to NATO’s eastern borders has put U.S. allies on high alert. But it’s unclear how many fighters are still stationed there, and who could assume command over them. The number of Wagner mercenaries in the country had been gradually decreasing even before Wednesday’s plane crash, with the majority going back to Russia, Andrii Demchenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s State Border Service, said Friday.But President Alexander Lukashenko insisted that Wagner was alive and well in Belarus. While some fighters were leaving, the “core” of the group remained, the country’s state media agency Belta reported him as saying Friday. He said he could call up to 10,000 fighters back within days, if needed. Prigozhin and his men swiftly captured Rostov-on-Don, the southern Russian city in June. Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesCould the plane crash have a direct impact on the war in Ukraine, where Wagner units led a monthslong bloody battle for the town of Bakhmut to deliver a small but symbolic victory that helped elevate Prigozhin’s status? Their “heroism” in Ukraine will not be forgotten, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday, while skirting questions about Wagner’s future.  With the Russian army trying to hold off Ukraine’s new counteroffensive, Moscow is desperate for reinforcements and may be eager to add most of the Wagner personnel into the armed forces, analysts said.  The most likely outcome is that Wagner will splinter into two, with the remaining leaderless groupings in Belarus disbanded, and the other faction active abroad morphing into something else that can be a tool of Russian foreign policy, according to Emily Ferris with the Royal United Services Institute. “The Kremlin will have likely learned its lesson that personalities like Prigozhin with their own dangerous ambitions are a wild card, and any new leader would likely be someone handpicked by the Kremlin,” she added.",[]

As the five #BRICS members, we have reached agreement on the guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures of the #BRICS expansion process.”More than 20 countries have formally applied for BRICS membership, including the six that Ramaphosa said were hereby invited.

We have tasked our foreign ministers to further develop the BRICS country model and a list of prospective partner countries and report by the next summit,” he said during a press briefing of BRICS officials on Thursday.“The relevance of the BRICS is demonstrated by the growing interest of other countries to join our group,” said Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “Now the BRICS is going up to 37% of the world’s GDP in terms of its purchasing power, and 46% in terms of the world population. BRICS will continue [being] open to new members.”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “expansion and modernization of BRICS is a message that all institutions in the world need to mold themselves according to changing times.”The UAE welcomed the membership announcement.“We respect the vision of the BRICS leadership and appreciate the inclusion of the UAE as a member to this important group. We look forward to a continued commitment of cooperation for the prosperity, dignity and benefit of all nations and people around the world,” UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed said on X in the wake of the announcement.Mohammad Jamshidi, deputy chief of staff for political affairs to the Iranian president, called Tehran’s BRICS membership “a strategic victory for Iran’s foreign policy” in a post on X.Currency cloutGustavo de Carvalho, policy analyst and senior researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said on X that the prospective new members will not only increase the visibility of the BRICS bloc, but also provide an opportunity for coalition participants to trade with one another in local currencies.Brazil’s da Silva on Thursday noted the BRICS group continues to study the possibility of a bloc currency, which could “increase our options for [a] means of payment and reduce our vulnerabilities,” according to an official summit translation.“It’s still uncertain what will happen to the group dynamics, but clearly it brings a new space for trade within the Global South. Much of the arguments in the communique reflected the collective voice on need for change of international institutions, especially international financial institutions like the World Bank, IMF [International Monetary Fund] and WTO [World Trade Organization],” de Carvalho noted.BRICS nations have struck different tones on their relationship with the West. Commercial and diplomatic tensions have risen between China and the U.S., while Russia is under a spate of Western sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine.“We are concerned about ongoing conflicts in many parts of the world. We stress our commitment to the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes through dialogue and inclusive consultation,” Ramaphosa said during the Thursday press briefing, without naming the conflicts in question.The new BRICS members bring their own challenges. Iran contends with U.S. sanctions over its nuclear program, while fresh clashes in Ethiopia have raised concerns over internal stability. Egypt has faced economic pressures, and Argentina recently sharply devalued its national currency — the peso — and jacked up interest rates following the shock primary election win by far-right libertarian Javier Milei.

The exiled mercenary leader's exact whereabouts remain unknown two months after he led the short-lived rebellion against Moscow’s military leadership.“We are working. The temperature is plus 50 (degrees Celsius). Everything is how we like it,” Prigozhin appears to say in the video while holding an assault rifle in his hands. Armed men on pickup trucks can be seen in the background, seemingly keeping a safety perimeter around him.“Wagner is conducting reconnaissance and search operations, making Russia even greater on every continent — and Africa even more free. Justice and happiness for the African nations,” he said, adding that he is hiring “real strong men” and will “continue working on tasks that were set to us and we promised to carry out,” without elaborating. Alongside the video address, one of the Telegram channels posted a phone number for potential recruits. NBC News was not able to verify the video’s authenticity, as well as when or where it was shot. Wagner has had extensive operations in Africa for years, with the Kremlin looking to extend Russia’s influence in the region. The White House National Security Council declined to comment directly on Prigozhin's current location. Asked about his whereabouts and the Wagner Group’s possible presence in Niger, the scene of a recent coup led by the head of the elected president's Presidential Guard, an NSC spokesperson said: “We’ve seen the Wagner transnational criminal group exploit and amplify instability around the world, including in Africa. There is no indication to date the Wagner Group instigated the actions of these members of the Nigerien Presidential Guard. However, Yevgeniy Prigozhin has publicly lauded this move. Everywhere we’ve seen Wagner go, death and destruction has followed. We are not going to speculate as the situation continues to be fluid.”The U.S. government and human rights groups have accused Prigozhin’s mercenary force of committing atrocities on the continent and of exploiting countries’ gold and diamond mines in return for military support. Prigozhin backed up the ongoing military coup in Niger in an audio message earlier this month, also shared by Wagner-linked Telegram channels, throwing his support behind the junta leaders and calling it “a liberation struggle.” NBC News could not verify the authenticity of that audio message. He was spotted by Russian media at the Russia-Africa summit in his hometown St. Petersburg last month.Brief glimpses like that have added to the mystery surrounding the mercenary chief’s fate.On June 23, Prigozhin led his Wagner fighters to capture the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and threatened to march on Moscow before standing down after an alleged deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. It was meant to see Prigozhin go into exile in Belarus and his fighters either sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry or join him there. The mutiny followed months of public criticism and mockery from Prigozhin of Russia’s top military brass, accusing them of incompetence in Ukraine.But the Kremlin’s treatment of Prigozhin since the rebellion has confounded many observers. Although Russian President Vladimir Putin called Wagner’s rebellion treason and a criminal investigation was initially launched, it does not appear that Prigozhin is facing charges or any real punishment for his stunning challenge to the Russian president’s authority. Putin praised the Russian military for stopping Prigozhin’s forces and averting a “civil war,” while the mercenary chief has been battered by the Kremlin’s propaganda as a self-centered traitor, exposing his lavish style. But then the Kremlin admitted that Putin met with Prigozhin and his commanders just five days after his rebellion. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also raised eyebrows last month after he said the Kremlin “neither has the ability nor desire” to track Prigozhin’s movements. Since the mutiny, only two audio statements came from Prigozhin’s official social channels. In them, he claimed that he never meant to topple the Putin regime, but that he was motivated by the desire to preserve his mercenary force — a marked departure for a man who used to dominate Russian social media space with almost daily video and audio messages from the front lines in Ukraine often laced with profanities.In July, Prigozhin appeared in another video shared by Wagner-affiliated channels and not verified by NBC News, but his face was barely visible against a dark backdrop. In it, he appeared to be speaking to his fighters stationed in Belarus and training the country’s troops, vowing to make the Belarusian army “the second strongest in the world.” The presence of his fighters close to Belarus’ western borders has unnerved NATO members. And on Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Belarus issued a warning for American citizens to depart the country immediately.The advisory cited that action by neighboring Lithuania, a U.S. ally, which closed two border crossings with Belarus last week, and the potential for further border closures by NATO members in the region. It also urged Americans not to travel to Belarus because of “Belarusian authorities’ continued facilitation of Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine” and “the buildup of Russian military forces” in the country.",[]

Saudi officials did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press, but they have previously denied its troops killed migrants. Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling migrants over the border, also did not respond to requests for comment.Some 750,000 Ethiopians live in Saudi Arabia, with as many as 450,000 likely having entered the kingdom without authorization, according to 2022 statistics from the International Organization for Migration. The two-year civil war in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region displaced tens of thousands of people.Saudi Arabia, struggling with youth unemployment, has been sending thousands back to Ethiopia in concert with Addis Abba.Human Rights Watch said it spoke to 38 Ethiopian migrants and four relatives of people who attempted to cross the border between March 2022 and June 2023 who said they saw Saudi guards shoot at migrants or launch explosives at groups.The report said the group also analyzed over 350 videos and photographs posted to social media or gathered from other sources filmed between May 12, 2021, and July 18, 2023. It also examined several hundred square miles of satellite imagery captured between February 2022 and July 2023.“These show dead and wounded migrants on the trails, in camps and in medical facilities, how burial sites near the migrant camps grew in size, the expanding Saudi Arabian border security infrastructure, and the routes currently used by the migrants to attempt border crossings,” the report said.An April 27 satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP showed the same tent structures identified by the rights group near al-Raqw, Yemen, on the Saudi border. Two sets of fence lines could be seen just across the border into Saudi Arabia.The site Human Rights Watch identified as the migrant camp at Al-Thabit also could be seen in satellite images, which corresponded to the group’s narrative that the camp largely had been dismantled in early April.Both areas are in northwestern Yemen, the stronghold of the country’s Houthi rebels. The U.N. has said that the Houthi-controlled immigration office “collaborates with traffickers to systematically direct migrants” to Saudi Arabia, bringing in $50,000 a week.The Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition has battled the Houthis since March 2015, without dislodging them from the capital. Fighting has largely halted between the Saudi-led forces and the Houthis as Riyadh seeks a way to end the war. However, throughout the war years, the Houthis claimed multiple incursions across the Saudi border in this mountainous region.Migrants from Ethiopia have found themselves detained, abused and even killed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the war. But in recent months, there has been growing concern from the U.N. human rights body about Saudi forces attacking migrants coming in from Yemen.An Oct. 3 letter to the kingdom from the U.N. said its investigators “received concerning allegations of cross-border artillery shelling and small arms fire allegedly by Saudi security forces causing the deaths of up to 430 and injuring 650 migrants.”“If migrants are captured, they are reportedly oftentimes subjected to torture by being lined up and shot through the side of the leg to see how far the bullet will go or asked if they prefer to be shot in the hand or the leg,” the letter from the U.N. reads. “Survivors of such attacks reported having to ‘play dead’ for a period of time in order to escape.”A letter sent by Saudi Arabia’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva in March said that it “categorically refutes” allegations that the kingdom carries out any “systematic” killings on the border. However, it also said the U.N. provided “limited information” so it could not “confirm or substantiate the allegations.”",[]

They are charged in a four-count indictment with the sexual exploitation of minors and with causing the death of Jordan DeMay, 17, who was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in March 2022 after the defendants allegedly tricked him into sending explicit photos of himself and threatened to share them with friends and family. Samuel faces a minimum sentence of 30 years in prison if convicted, and Samson faces a minimum sentence of five years.“Here was three Nigerian men that conspired from across the planet, and came into my house in the middle of night while I was sleeping, and murdered my son,” his father John DeMay told NBC News in May.Jordan DeMay.Courtesy DeMay familyThe FBI issued a public safety alert last year warning that thousands of teens, particularly young males, are being targeted in “sextortion” schemes, most of which originate abroad. West Africa has long been identified as a hub of cybercriminals who prey on Americans, but U.S. authorities traditionally have not had much success in securing law enforcement cooperation in those countries to make arrests.“This case is a huge deal, and it was the result of a lot of hard work behind the scenes, government to government,” one senior Justice Department official said. “It really underscores the lengths to which we will go to bring these guys to justice.”Earlier this year, agents from the FBI in Michigan travelled to Nigeria “to conduct a cooperative investigation with Nigerian law enforcement officials,” the Justice Department said. U.S. officials worked to prepare a request for provisional arrest, with a view toward extradition, of the two Ogoshis and a third defendant, Ezekiel Robert. Robert’s extradition is still pending.In May, the three men were indicted by a federal grand jury in Michigan. On July 20, a Nigerian judge ordered both Ogoshis to be turned over to the U.S. to face the charges in the indictment. On Aug. 3, the Nigerian solicitor-general signed the final surrender order, authorizing the U.S. to bring the Ogoshis to West Michigan.“Financial sextortion is a global crisis that impacts teens in our country and around the world,” said Devin J. Kowalski, acting special agent in charge of the FBI in Michigan. “As this case demonstrates, the FBI is committed to working closely with our domestic and international law enforcement partners to prevent young men and women from becoming victims of this tragic crime.”According to the indictment, the defendants bought hacked social media accounts and used the accounts to pose as young women to lure teenage and young adult males into sexual chats. They allegedly used an Instagram account bearing the username “dani.robertts,” which communicated with Jordan DeMay shortly before his death. After initiating chat conversations with the victims, the defendants used the internet to compile dossiers identifying their home addresses, schools, family members and friends.The indictment says the defendants then used their female personas to induce their victims to produce and send sexually explicit images of themselves. The defendants then allegedly created collages that included the sexually explicit image alongside other images of the victims from social media, including images of the victims’ school, family and friends. The defendants then threatened to disclose the collages to others, including family, friends and classmates, via social media unless the victims paid money. The grand jury alleges the defendants engaged in this extortion and attempted extortion of more than 100 people.Jordan Demay had been a senior nearing graduation from Marquette Senior High School, where he played football and basketball. Six hours after he was approached for money, he was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, his parents said.They provided excerpts of text conversations between DeMay and the extortionists. One said, “I have screenshot all ur followers and tags can send this nudes to everyone and also send your nudes to your Family and friends Until it goes viral… All you’ve to do is to cooperate with me and I won’t expose you Are you gonna cooperate with me...Just pay me right now...And I won’t expose you.”The extortionists wanted $1,000, but DeMay could send only $300.DeMay messaged them: “I’m kms rn [killing myself right now].

Later that day, Nigerien security and military leaders overthrew the country’s democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum.Niger was the sixth country in Africa’s sprawling Sahel region, which spans the continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, to have experienced a coup since 2020. It is also a base for emboldened Islamist militants and one of the world’s largest producers of uranium, which is coveted by many nations. France, the former colonial power in the region, has scaled back its once-frequent military interventions.But the U.S. response to the coup raises questions about how effectively the West will be able to counter Islamist terrorist groups and Russian disinformation in a region that risks becoming a region of failed states. On Sunday, Niger's new military leaders announced that they will prosecute the country's democratically elected president for ""high treason,"" a charge that could result in the death penalty.Though rumors of a coup had circulated in Niger for some time, U.S. officials were blindsided when it happened because the U.S. has not prioritized Africa for years and does not have enough personnel there, more than a dozen current and former U.S. diplomatic and military officials said. The U.S. did not even have an ambassador in Niger on the day of the coup. Once the coup began in the nation of roughly 25 million, it took U.S. officials days to accept that short of an international military intervention, it would not be reversed. Asked why the U.S. was caught off guard, White House National Security Council officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",[]

Conflict experts say it would likely comprise some 5,000 troops led by Nigeria and could be ready within weeks.After the ECOWAS meeting, neighboring Ivory Coast’s president, Alassane Ouattara, said his country would take part in the military operation, along with Nigeria and Benin.“Ivory Coast will provide a battalion and has made all the financial arrangements ... We are determined to install Bazoum in his position. Our objective is peace and stability in the sub-region,” Ouattara said on state television.Niger, an impoverished country of some 25 million people, was seen as one of the last hopes for Western nations to partner with in beating back a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group that’s ravaged the region. France and the United States have more than 2,500 military personnel in Niger and together with other European partners had poured hundreds of millions of dollars into propping up its military.The junta responsible for spearheading the coup, led by Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani, has exploited anti-French sentiment among the population to shore up its support.On Thursday night after the summit, France’s foreign ministry said it supported “all conclusions adopted.” U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken said his country appreciated “the determination of ECOWAS to explore all options for the peaceful resolution of the crisis” and would hold the junta accountable for the safety and security of President Bazoum. However, he did not specify whether the U.S. supported the deployment of troops.The mutinous soldiers that ousted Bazoum more than two weeks ago have entrenched themselves in power, appear closed to dialogue and have refused to release the president. Representatives of the junta told U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland of the threat to Bazoum’s life during her visit to the country this week, a Western military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.A U.S. official confirmed that account, also speaking on condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to speak to the media.“The threat to kill Bazoum is grim,” said Alexander Thurston, assistant professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati. There have been unwritten rules until now about how overthrown presidents will be treated and violence against Bazoum would evoke some of the worst coups of the past, he said.Human Rights Watch said Friday that it had spoken to Bazoum, who said that his 20-year-old son was sick with a serious heart condition and has been refused access to a doctor. The president said he hasn’t had electricity for nearly 10 days and isn’t allowed to see family, friends or bring supplies into the house.It’s unclear if the threat on Bazoum’s life would change ECOWAS’ decision to intervene military. It might give them pause, or push the parties closer to dialogue, but the situation has entered uncharted territory, analysts say.“An ECOWAS invasion to restore constitutional order into a country of Niger’s size and population would be unprecedented,” said Nate Allen, an associate professor at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Niger has a fairly large and well-trained army that, if it actively resisted an invasion, could pose significant problems for ECOWAS. This would be a very large and significant undertaking, he said.While the region oscillates between mediation and preparing for war, Nigeriens are suffering the impact of harsh economic and travel sanctions imposed by ECOWAS.Before the coup, more than 4 million Nigeriens were reliant on humanitarian assistance and the situation could become more dire, said Louise Aubin, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Niger.“The situation is alarming. ... We’ll see an exponential rise and more people needing more humanitarian assistance,” she said, adding that the closure of land and air borders makes it hard to bring aid into the country and it’s unclear how long the current stock will last.Aid groups are battling restrictions on multiple fronts.ECOWAS sanctions have banned the movement of goods between member countries, making it hard to bring in materials. The World Food Program has some 30 trucks stuck at the Benin border unable to cross. Humanitarians are also trying to navigate restrictions within the country as the junta has closed the airspace, making it hard to get clearance to fly the humanitarian planes that transport goods and personnel to hard-hit areas.Flights are cleared on a case-by-case basis and there’s irregular access to fuel, which disrupts aid operations, Aubin said.The U.N. has asked ECOWAS to make exceptions to the sanctions and is speaking to Niger’s foreign ministry about doing the same within the country.",[]

They really underestimate all Africans,” he said.Museveni said that if Uganda needed to borrow, it could tap other sources, and that oil production expected to start by 2025 would provide additional revenues.He added he hoped the World Bank would reconsider its decision.The government will ask parliament to vote through a revised 2023-2024 (July-June) budget to reflect the potential financial impact of the lending suspension, junior finance minister Henry Musasizi told parliament on Thursday.“We shall be coming in one week or so... to ask for your approval,” Musasizi told lawmakers.In June, the United States imposed visa restrictions on some Ugandan officials in response to the law.

Abdourahmane Tchiani. Nigerien officials blocked both meetings.Nuland, along with U.S. diplomatic and military officials instead met with the junta’s chief of defense, Gen. Moussa Salaou Barmou, who has led the Nigerien Special Forces for the past decade. He was trained by American forces and worked closely with U.S. military leaders and troops assigned to train and support Nigerien Special Forces with intelligence collection in their fight against Islamic extremist groups.The Americans met with the defense chief and others from the new junta for more than two hours and Nuland described the conversation as “quite difficult” at times.Officials familiar with the discussions said the military junta made it clear to Nuland and the other U.S. officials present that they believe very strongly that their seizure of power was just, that they have broad public support, and that Bazoum is no longer the legitimate leader of Niger. Barmou also made it clear that the coup leaders will not release Bazoum from house detention and that he will not be returned to power, the officials said. Barmou also did not guarantee Bazoum’s safety, especially if outside military forces intervene in Niger, two of the officials said.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Bazoum on Tuesday afternoon and State Department officials on Wednesday again called on coup leaders to protect him.“We are deeply concerned about the welfare of President Bazoum and his family, and the deteriorating conditions of their detention,” said State Department spokesperson Matt Miller. “As we have since the beginning of this situation, in both public and private communications, the United States continues to raise the importance of President Bazoum and his family’s well-being and safety. We reiterate our calls for their immediate release.”“[N]uland also met with NGO leaders and others from civil society,” Miller told NBC News. “She heard very clearly from them that they are deeply concerned about the situation. … [I]t’s clear there are many people who aren’t going to stadiums and marching in the streets the way you see so-called supporters of the junta doing because they have very real concerns about their safety if they do so. But their support for democracy is very much real.""A U.S. official who asked not to be named said that the coup leaders appear increasingly defiant. “The junta appears to be fairly dug in,” the official said. “There is no indication of them being willing to compromise right now. In fact, they are becoming harder in their views.” Several U.S. officials agreed that while there is still some hope for diplomacy, it is fading. “There’s no keen sense of optimism after the meeting,” one official said. American officials say they are not yet leaning toward formally declaring this a coup, which would under U.S. law trigger a halt to training and hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Niger. The U.S. military support in the country gives Washington a bargaining chip, because the coup leaders told U.S. officials they want to keep it.“We are trying to leverage the support that we have that we know they want,” one U.S. official said. Leaders from West African states will meet in Abuja, Nigeria, on Thursday to discuss a possible military intervention in Niger. The members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) met four days after the coup and warned the coup leaders to release Bazoum within one week or they would consider military action. Three days after that deadline passed, the president remains under house arrest. Now U.S. officials believe members of ECOWAS have drawn up rough plans for military intervention in consultation with the French military. “French military planners are consulting with ECOWAS right now,” one U.S. official said. According to American officials familiar with the discussions during the Monday meeting with Barmou, he told the U.S. delegation that the junta believes the threat of an ECOWAS military intervention is very real and they believe that if ECOWAS intervenes militarily they will do so by the end of August, with support from France. Miller, the State Department spokesman, said: “ECOWAS has publicly indicated that military intervention is a last resort. We are focused on finding a diplomatic solution and are in close contact with ECOWAS leadership and our partners across the region. … At the end of the day, we all want a peaceful end to this crisis and the preservation of constitutional order in Niger.”Not all ECOWAS countries are in favor of military intervention, two American officials said, and many of the members have militaries that are small, underfunded and already taxed with domestic security issues.The U.S. military has roughly 1,110 troops in Niger at three bases. The Biden administration has made no decision about drawing down the U.S. troop presence there. The U.S. does have contingency plans for consolidating or withdrawing U.S. troops if neighboring nations send in forces and the situation becomes dangerous.In the hours after the coup, the military junta closed Nigerien airspace, but since then some U.S. drone flights have been authorized to fly, but not at the same pace as before the coup, according to two U.S. defense officials.“We continue to coordinate U.S. military flights on a case-by-case basis while the air space is closed in Niger. For the security of our operations, we cannot discuss the details of drone flights,” according to a U.S. military official.The U.S. mission to train Nigeriens to counter Islamic extremist groups in the country remains on hold.",[]

The coup’s top leader, former presidential guard head Abdourahamane Tchiani, did not meet with the Americans.In other developments Monday, leaders of West Africa’s regional bloc said they would meet later this week to discuss next steps after the junta defied a deadline to reinstate the president. The meeting was scheduled for Thursday in Abuja, the capital of neighboring Nigeria, according to a spokesman for the ECOWAS bloc.Meanwhile, the junta’s mutinous soldiers closed the country’s airspace and accused foreign powers of preparing an attack.State television reported the junta’s latest actions Sunday night, hours before the deadline set by ECOWAS, which has warned of using military force if Bazoum is not returned to power.A spokesman for the coup leaders, Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane, noted “the threat of intervention being prepared in a neighboring country,” and said Niger’s airspace will be closed until further notice. Any attempt to fly over the country will be met with “an energetic and immediate response.”The junta also claimed that two central African countries were preparing for an invasion, but did not name them. It called on Niger’s population to defend the nation.The coup toppled Bazoum, whose ascendency was Niger’s first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence from France in 1960. The coup also raised questions about the future of the fight against extremism in Africa’s Sahel region, where Russia and Western countries have vied for influence.Niger had been seen by the United States and others as the last major counterterrorism partner in the Sahel, south of the Sahara Desert, where groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are expanding their influence.Also Monday, Mali said it and Burkina Faso, both neighbors of Niger run by military juntas, were sending delegations to Niger to show support. Both countries have said they would consider any intervention in Niger as a declaration of war against them.Mohamed Toumba, one of the leading figures of the junta, at a rally of coup supporters in Niamey. Balima Boreima / Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesRegional tensions have mounted since the coup nearly two weeks ago, when mutinous soldiers detained Bazoum and installed Tchiani as head of state. Analysts believe the coup was triggered by a power struggle between Tchiani and the president, who was about to fire him.It was not immediately clear what ECOWAS leaders will do now. The region is divided on a course of action. There was no sign of military forces gathering at Niger’s border with Nigeria, the likely entry point by land.Nigeria’s Senate has pushed back on the plan to invade, urging Nigeria’s president, the bloc’s current chair, to explore options other than the use of force. ECOWAS can still move ahead, as final decisions are made by consensus by member states.Guinea and neighboring Algeria, which is not an ECOWAS member, have come out against the use of force. Senegal’s government has said it would participate in a military operation if it went ahead, and Ivory Coast has expressed support for the bloc’s efforts to restore constitutional order.The junta has asked for help from the Russian mercenary group Wagner, according to Wassim Nasr, a journalist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center.However, Nuland indicated that coup leaders did not seem receptive to welcoming Wagner mercenaries into the country, as has happened with several surrounding unstable West African countries.“I will say that I got the sense from my meetings today that the people who have taken the action here understand very well the risks to their sovereignty when Wagner is invited,” Nuland said.The junta is exploiting anti-French sentiments to shore up its support base and has severed security ties with France, which still has 1,500 military personnel in Niger for counterterrorism efforts.On Monday, France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally discouraged any travel to Niger, Burkina Faso or Mali, and called on French nationals to be extremely vigilant. France has suspended almost 500 million euros ($550 million) in aid to Burkina Faso.It’s not clear what will happen to the French military presence, or to the 1,100 U.S. military personnel also in Niger.Many people, largely youth, have rallied around the junta, taking to the streets at night to patrol after being urged to guard against foreign intervention.“While they (jihadists) kill our brothers and sisters ... ECOWAS didn’t intervene. Is it now that they will intervene?” said Amadou Boukari, a coup supporter at Sunday’s rally. “Shame on ECOWAS.”",[]

Salifou Mody, to neighboring Mali, where he made contact with someone from Wagner, Wassim Nasr, a journalist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, told The Associated Press. He said three Malian sources and a French diplomat confirmed the meeting first reported by France 24.“They need (Wagner) because they will become their guarantee to hold onto power,” he said, adding that the group is considering the request.Niger’s junta faces a Sunday deadline set by the regional bloc known as ECOWAS to release and reinstate the democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who has described himself as a hostage.Defense chiefs from ECOWAS members finalized an intervention plan on Friday and urged militaries to ready resources after a mediation team sent to Niger on Thursday wasn’t allowed to enter the city or meet with junta leader Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani.After his visit to Mali, run by a sympathetic junta, Mody warned against a military intervention, vowing that Niger would do what it takes not to become “a new Libya,” Niger’s state television reported Friday.Niger has been seen as the West’s last reliable counterterrorism partner in a region where coups have been common in recent years. Juntas have been rejecting former colonizer France and turning toward Russia. Wagner operates in a handful of African countries, including Mali, where human rights groups have accused its forces of abuses.One can’t say there’s any direct implication of Russia in Niger’s coup, but “clearly, there’s an opportunistic attitude on the part of Russia, which tries to support destabilization efforts wherever it finds them,” French foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told broadcaster BFM on Friday. Days after Niger’s junta seized power, residents waved Russian flags in the streets.The spokeswoman described Wagner as a “recipe for chaos.”On Saturday, France’s foreign affairs minister, Catherine Colonna, said the regional threat of force was credible and warned the putschists to take it seriously. “Coups are no longer appropriate ... It’s time to put an end to it,” she said. The ministry said France supports “with firmness and determination” the ECOWAS efforts to make sure the coup leaders fail, and it called for Bazoum and all members of his government to be freed.Niger’s military leaders have been following the playbook of Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso, also run by a junta, but it’s moving faster to consolidate power, Nasr said: “(Tchiani) chose his path, so he’s going full on it without wasting time because there’s international mobilization.”One question is how the international community will react if Wagner is brought in, he said. When Wagner came into Mali at the end of 2021, the French military was ousted shortly afterward after years of partnership. Wagner was later designated a terrorist organization by the United States, and international partners might have a stronger reaction now, Nasr said.And much more is at stake in Niger, where the U.S. and other partners have poured hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance in efforts to combat the region’s growing jihadi threat. France has 1,500 soldiers in Niger, though coup leaders say they have severed security agreements with Paris, and the U.S. has 1,100 military personnel in the country.“At the moment, there’s no real indication that the (junta) is going to soften its tone or make concessions ahead of the deadline,” said Andrew Lebovich, research fellow with the Clingendael Institute and postdoctoral fellow with the Danish Institute for International Studies, saying an intervention “potentially serious consequences for Niger and for the region.”It’s unclear what an intervention would look like or when it would begin. Niger’s junta has called on the population to watch for spies, and self-organized defense groups have mobilized at night to monitor cars and patrol the capital.Any intervention is fraught with risk, said a report by the Hudson Institute. “If the junta were to dig in its heels and rally the populace around the flag — possibly even arming civilian militias — the intervention could morph into a multifaceted counterinsurgency that ECOWAS would not be prepared to handle,” it said.While some in Niger are bracing for a fight, others are trying to cope with travel and economic sanctions imposed by ECOWAS after the coup. The sanctions have closed land and air borders with ECOWAS countries and suspended commercial and financial transactions with member states.Residents said the price of goods is rising and there’s limited access to cash.“We are deeply concerned about the consequences of these sanctions, especially their impacts on the supply of essential food products, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, petroleum products and electricity,” said Sita Adamou, president of Niger’s Association to Defend Human Rights.",[]

There was some cause for optimism in 2021, when Bazoum was elected in the country’s first democratic transfer of power. And it has become an anchor for Western-backed counterterrorism efforts in the volatile region.However, the military takeover last week marks the seventh coup in West and Central Africa in three years, a democratic backsliding that worries many African and Western governments.In his op-ed, Bazoum called the coup a ""cynical effort to undermine the remarkable progress Niger has made under democracy.""""Niger stands as the last bastion of respect for human rights amid the authoritarian movements that have overtaken some of our neighbors,"" he said.

I was shaking, so scared. But I’m here.”Their relief at being rescued soon gave way to surprise.The four men said they had hoped to reach Europe and were shocked to learn they had in fact landed on the other side of the Atlantic, in Brazil. Two of the men have since been returned to Nigeria upon their request, while Yeye and Roman Ebimene Friday, a 35-year-old from Bayelsa state, have applied for asylum in Brazil.“I pray the government of Brazil will have pity on me,” said Friday, who had already attempted to flee Nigeria by ship once before but was arrested by authorities there.Nigerian refugees Thankgod Matthew, left, and Roman Ebimene in Sao Paulo on July 26, 2023 after being rescued from a ship rudder on the Brazilian coast.Reuters via ReduxBoth men said economic hardship, political instability and crime had left them with little option but to abandon their native Nigeria. Africa’s most populous country has longstanding issues of violence and poverty, and kidnappings are endemic.Yeye, a pentecostal minister from Lagos state, said his peanut and palm oil farm was destroyed by floods this year, leaving him and his family homeless. He hopes they can now join him in Brazil.Friday said his journey to Brazil began on June 27, when a fisherman friend rowed him up to the stern of the Liberian-flagged Ken Wave, docked in Lagos, and left him by the rudder. To his surprise, he found three men already there, waiting for the ship to depart. Friday said he was terrified. He had never met his new shipmates and feared they could toss him into the sea at any moment.Once the ship was moving, Friday said the four men made every effort not to be discovered by the ship’s crew, who they also worried might offer them a watery grave.“Maybe if they catch you they will throw you in the water,” he said. “So we taught ourselves never to make a noise.”Spending two weeks within spitting distance of the Atlantic Ocean was perilous.To prevent themselves from falling into the water, Friday said the men rigged up a net around the rudder and tied themselves to it with a rope. When he looked down, he said he could see “big fish like whales and sharks.” Due to the cramped conditions and the noise of the engine, sleep was rare and risky. “I was very happy when we got rescued,” he said.Father Paolo Parise, a priest at the Sao Paulo shelter, said he had come across other cases of stowaways, but never one so dangerous. Their journey paid testament to lengths people will go in search of a new start, he said. “People do unimaginable and deeply dangerous things.”",[]

Some delegations were welcomed with a military orchestra, and Zimbabwe’s president received a helicopter as a gift from President Vladimir Putin. Putin billed Russia’s second summit with African leaders and delegates as “a crucial event” to boost ties and partnership for many years to come. For Russia, the event was a battle for influence and allies, and showed how isolated Russia could become in the shadow of its invasion of Ukraine.“We see the same, reciprocal interest to act together, hand in hand, on the part of our African friends,” Putin said. International powers have long been attracted to Africa’s wealth of raw materials and minerals, such as copper and gold. The war has also renewed global interest in African oil and gas amid sanctions on Russian products. Burkina Faso's Capt. Ibrahim Traore shakes hands with President Putin on Thursday. Sergei Bobylev / TASS Host Photo Agency Pool Photo via APBut when Putin and delegation leaders stood side by side for the family photo, there were notable absences. Only 17 heads of state were in attendance, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, down sharply from the 43 who participated in the first Russia-Africa summit in Sochi in 2019. Peskov blamed the West’s “absolutely unconcealed brazen interference” for some African leaders’ deciding to skip the forum, which ran Thursday and Friday.While pressure from the U.S., France and other countries may have influenced some leaders’ travel plans, geopolitics and economics were also on the agenda. Almost a year and a half since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, food insecurity was high on the summit’s agenda. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has already triggered sharp rises in the price of food and oil, and exacerbated a global food crisis.Days earlier, Russia announced it would suspend its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed food exports to flow from Ukrainian ports, a decision that immediately prompted warnings from international aid agencies about the impact on poorer countries.Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed African leaders to demand answers from Russia.“They know exactly who’s to blame for this current situation,” Blinken said while on a visit to New Zealand.Under the Black Sea Grain initiative, 57% of the grain from Ukraine went to Africa and Asia, according to the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, making these countries especially vulnerable. So it is no surprise that some leaders urged Putin to revive the grain deal. “I am not looking forward to a compromised solution when it comes to the grain deal,” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi told Putin on Friday. “We want one that takes into consideration the needs and benefits of all sides that could stop the continuous climb of the price of grain.”Delegates inspect weapons at an exhibition on the sidelines of the summit on Friday.Yegor Aleyev / TASS Host Photo Agency Pool Photo via APIn the summit’s opening session, Putin announced he would give  around 27,000 to 52,000 tons of grain in the next several months to six African nations: Burkina Faso, Mali, Zimbabwe, Somalia, the Central African Republic and Eritrea. He said Western sanctions imposed over the war prevented Russia from supplying fertilizers.Despite Putin’s promise to deliver grain, some African leaders made it clear the war’s ramifications couldn’t be ignored.“It is important but maybe not enough,” Azali Assoumani, president of the Union of Comoros and chair of the African Union, said Friday near the end of the summit. “We need to achieve a cease-fire. Because it is always something unpredictable. And the longer [the war] is, the more unpredictable it becomes.” DividedAfrican leaders have been divided in their response to the war. Fifteen African countries abstained from voting on a March 2022 United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while two nations voted against the resolution. Experts said their neutral stance stemmed partially from Russia’s involvement during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union provided funding and military support for several liberation movements, a point that was repeated by several leaders throughout the summit.Russia’s support during Africa’s anti-colonial struggles also bolstered political ties with some African nations. Russian and African leaders signed a declaration on the last day of the summit, agreeing to cooperate in seeking compensation for damages caused by colonialism, and the return of cultural artifacts. “While [African countries] want to guard their sovereignty, they do not want to choose sides,” said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They don’t want to continue fighting on behalf of Russia either.” At the 2019 summit, Putin sought to rekindle relations established during the Cold War and pledged to double trade with African countries to $40 billion in five years. Today, trade has stalled at $18 billion, and Russia is nowhere near one of the continent’s top trade partners, according to the International Monetary Fund.Ovigwe Eguegu, a policy analyst for Development Reimagined, said Russia relied heavily on political rhetoric to counter Western influence, rather than economic might.“Russia thrives in places where there’s an opportunity to grow in places with two components: where there is a failing state and where there is some form of disappointment or dissatisfaction with Western solutions,” he said. “The challenge with Russia-Africa relations is that [Russia] cannot compete on investment. It cannot compete on big infrastructure. So Russia’s strength is really in political relationships.”The summit also put pressure on Russia to gain influence amid competing global interest in Africa, particularly from the U.S. and China. The U.S. hosted its own Africa summit last year, with Biden telling leaders the U.S. was “all in” on Africa’s future. China is a dominant source of aid and investment across the continent.“This is the real game. You are in a geopolitical competition, and with Africa, everything is up for grabs,” Eguegu said.Russian President Vladimir Putin with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.Mikhail Metzel / TASS Host Photo Agency Pool Photo via APBut leaders at the summit said they wanted a bigger seat at the table. The continent’s 54 countries make up the largest voting bloc at the United Nations, and leaders increased their calls for the African Union to become a permanent member of the group of 20 leading rich and industrial nations. They also pressed Putin to move ahead with a peace plan proposed last month to end the war in Ukraine. As Russia competes alongside other major powers for influence, experts said Africa was making it clear it wanted to be an independent geopolitical force.“Africans are not interested in being caught in this new wave of power competition,” said Dizolele. “Africans are interested in the simple question: who brings what to the table.”",[]

The initiative is credited with helping lower soaring prices of wheat, vegetable oil and other food commodities.Ukraine and Russia are both major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other affordable food products on which developing nations rely.The grain deal provided assurances that ships won’t be attacked entering and leaving Ukrainian ports, while a separate agreement facilitated the movement of Russian food and fertilizer. While Western sanctions do not apply to Moscow’s agricultural shipments, some companies may be wary of doing business with Russia because of the measures.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the suspension was expected and believes it’s political theater.“The statement itself immediately includes an escape clause,” he said. “Therefore, we are dealing with classic public techniques of the Russian Federation that no longer require significant reciprocal reactions.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the country’s foreign minister would speak with his Russian counterpart Monday — and that he was hopeful the deal would be extended.The suspension of the deal sent wheat prices up about 3% in Chicago trading, to $6.81 a bushel. Analysts don’t expect more than a temporary bump to food commodity prices because countries such as Russia and Brazil have ratcheted up wheat and corn exports, but food insecurity worldwide is growing.The Black Sea Grain Initiative has allowed three Ukrainian ports to export 32.9 million metric tons of grain and other food to the world, more than half of that to developing nations, according to the joint coordination center in Istanbul.The agreement was renewed for 60 days in May, but in recent months, the amount of food shipped and the number of vessels departing Ukraine have plunged, with Russia accused of preventing additional ships from participating.The war in Ukraine sent food commodity prices to record highs last year and contributed to a global food crisis also tied to other conflicts, the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic, droughts and other climate factors.High costs of grain needed for food staples in countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Nigeria exacerbated economic challenges and helped push millions more into poverty or food insecurity.Rising food prices affect people in developing countries disproportionately, because they spend more of their money on meals.Under the deal, prices of global food commodities such as wheat and vegetable oil have fallen, but food was already expensive before the war in Ukraine and the relief hasn’t trickled down to kitchen tables.“The Black Sea deal is absolutely critical for the food security of a number of countries,” and its loss will compound the problems for those facing high debt levels and climate fallout, said Simon Evenett, a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said this month that 45 countries need outside food assistance, with high local food prices “a driver of worrying levels of hunger” in those places.",[]

Human Rights Office, at least 87 people — some of them from the ethnic African Masalit tribe — were killed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and an affiliated Arab militia. Their bodies were dumped in a grave just outside the West Darfur city of Geneina, the agency said.Sudan has been rocked by violence since mid-April when tensions between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces erupted into open fighting.Darfur has been one of the epicenters of the 12-week conflict, morphing into an arena of ethnic violence with the paramilitary troops and allied Arab militias attacking the Masalit and other African ethnic groups.The first 37 bodies were buried in the shallow grave on June 20, the U.N. agency said in a statement from Geneva. The next day, another 50 bodies were dumped at the same site. Seven women and seven children were among those buried.RSF and Arab militia forced local residents to bury the bodies, the U.N. agency said. The killings took place between June 13 and June 21 in the Al-Madaress and Al-Jamarek districts of the city, following the violence that erupted in the aftermath of the assassination of West Darfur’s governor, it added.The governor, Khamis Abdalla Abkar, had accused the RSF and allied militias of attacking local communities across Geneina in an interview with Saudi-owned television station, Al-Hadath. Hours later he was abducted and killed under circumstances that remain unclear.Over the past two months, the paramilitary and their allies rampaged through West Darfur, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, rights groups say. Just over 238,000 people have crossed the border into neighboring Chad, according to recent figures from the International Organization for Migration. Amid the pillaging, entire towns and villages in the province of West Darfur have been burned to the ground and looted.News of the mass grave comes just days after Human Rights Watch called for the International Criminal Court to investigate atrocities in Darfur. In highlighting its call, it pointed to the “summary executions” of at least 28 Masalit tribesmen at the hands of RSF and allied Arab militias in the town of Misterei, also in West Darfur province.The New York-based rights group said that several thousand members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and their allies rampaged through Misterei on May 28 armed with assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, before slaughtering its Masalit male inhabitants. A total of 97 people were killed in the attack, it said.Darfur had been the scene of genocidal war in the early 2000s, when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum of discrimination. Former dictator Omar al-Bashir’s government was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes, known as Janjaweed, who targeted civilians.JanJaweed fighters were folded into the RSF.",[]

Secretary-General António Guterres said Sudan was on the brink of a “full-scale civil war” as fierce clashes between rival generals continued unabated Sunday in the capital, Khartoum.He warned on Saturday evening that the war between the Sudanese military and a powerful paramilitary force is likely to destabilize the entire region, according to Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the secretary-general.Sudan descended into chaos after months of tension between military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and his rival Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open fighting in mid-April.Health Minister Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim said in televised comments last month that the clashes have killed over 3,000 people and wounded over 6,000 others. The death tally, however, is highly likely to be much higher. More than 2.9 million people have fled their homes to safer areas inside Sudan or crossed into neighboring countries, according to U.N. figures.The fighting came 18 months after the two generals led a military coup in October 2021 that toppled a Western-backed civilian transitional government. The conflict dashed Sudanese hopes of a peaceful transition to democracy after a popular uprising forced the military removal of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.The war has turned the capital Khartoum and other urban areas across the country into battlefields.Residents in Khartoum said fierce fighting was underway early Sunday south of the capital. The warring factions were using heavy weapons in the battles in the Kalaka neighborhood and the military’s aircraft were seen hovering over the area, said resident Abdalla al-Fatih.In his statement, Guterres also condemned an airstrike Saturday that health authorities said killed at least 22 people in Omdurman, a city just across the Nile from the capital, Khartoum. The assault was one of the deadliest in the conflict.The secretary-general also decried the large-scale violence and casualties in the western region of Darfur, which has experienced some of the worst fighting in the ongoing conflict, Haq said in a statement.“There is an utter disregard for humanitarian and human rights law that is dangerous and disturbing,” Guterres said.U.N. officials have said the violence in the region has recently taken an ethnic dimension, with the RSF and Arab militias reportedly targeting non-Arab tribes in Darfur, a sprawling region consisting of five provinces. Last month, the governor of Darfur, Mini Arko Minawi, said the region was sliding back to its past genocide, referring to the conflict that engulfed the region in the early 2000s.Entire towns and villages in West Darfur province were overrun by the RSF and their allied militias, forcing tens of thousands of residents to flee to neighboring Chad. Activists have reported many residents killed, women and girls raped, and properties looted and burned to the ground.There were clashes between the military and the RSF elsewhere in Sudan on Sunday including the province of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and Blue Nile.",[]

Gathered near a helipad, they sorted through bags and other belongings spread out on the ground around them.An image from a video obtained by NBC News that appears to show dozens of Wagner operatives in uniform at a military base in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic.
Obtained by NBC NewsThe regional French-language newspaper Jeune Afrique first reported the departure of hundreds of Wagner personnel on Thursday.The flights came as the Kremlin has sought to reassert its authority over the organization two weeks after a short-lived rebellion in which Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin openly defied Russian President Vladimir Putin and ordered his troops fighting in Ukraine to march on Moscow. The June 23-24 rebellion ended after Belarus brokered a deal between Wagner and Putin’s government. But how the Russian president will manage the group’s sprawling military and business operations in the Middle East and Africa remains an open question.It was unclear if the departure of the Wagner personnel from the Central African Republic was part of a routine rotation of troops, a large-scale sacking by Moscow designed to curtail Prigozhin’s influence, or if Wagner loyalists have refused to work under the Russian Ministry of Defense.  Moscow might be attempting to re-establish its control over Wagner’s forces, but it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions, according to Nathalia Dukhan, senior investigator at The Sentry, a nonprofit advocacy group that reports on corruption, repression and human rights abuses.Other experts agreed. “Purges are very likely, as loyalty is the hot button issue of the moment for Putin,” said Alia Brahimi, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank.In the days after the mutiny, Putin praised Russian military leaders for fending off Prigozhin’s mutiny and for averting a “civil war.” Russian authorities have raided Wagner’s headquarters in St. Petersburg.Fidele Gouandjika, an adviser to Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, said there had been “no change” in the Wagner Group’s presence in recent days. Russian “instructors” were still on the ground, along with the organization’s senior leader, Vitali Perfilev, Gouandjika told NBC News. The mutiny led by Prigozhin two weeks ago was “an internal matter for Russia,” he said, adding that the Central African Republic had an agreement with the Russian Federation, not the Wagner group.A senior Wagner representative in the country, Dmitry Sytii, who runs the Russian cultural center, also implied that the paramilitaries had not been ordered to leave the country, telling NBC News: “I haven’t started to pack my bags yet. When is the plane?”Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said it was unclear if Wagner was facing a major shake-up in the African nation.“We are hearing rumors from multiple sources, including from some at the airport, but the movement of Wagner forces in and out of Bangui M’Poko International Airport is not in and of itself unusual,"" Mudge said. ""So for right now, it’s still very much a situation of wait and see.” The White House National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment. Last week, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said there was “no indication that Wagner is decreasing its intent to exploit African countries.”Wagner mercenaries first arrived in the Central African Republic in 2018 as military advisers and have worked alongside the nation's armed forces to fight a rebellion threatening the government. The U.S. government and human rights groups have accused Wagner of committing atrocities in Africa and of exploiting countries’ gold and diamond mines. In January, the U.S. designated Wagner a transnational criminal organization.The Kremlin likely will change Wagner’s name and oust some figures deemed too close to Prigozhin, said Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at The Soufan Center, a nonprofit research center focusing on global security issues.But even with a “rebranding,” Russia is unlikely to withdraw from Wagner’s security contracts, disinformation operations and mining ventures that have boosted Moscow’s reach in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, Clarke and other experts said.“The services that Wagner provides for the Russians in Africa are essential,” Clarke said. “That’s not going to go away. They need it.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a recent interview with Russia Today that Prigozhin’s revolt would not affect Moscow’s relations with “partners and friends,” and that Wagner operatives would remain in the Central African Republic, Mali and other African countries.“At their request, several hundred servicemen are working in the CAR as instructors — this work, of course, will continue,” Lavrov said. In public remarks after the mutiny, Putin thanked the military and law enforcement for halting the rebellion and said for the first time in public that the government had bankrolled the Wagner Group, providing 86 billion rubles, or about $1 billion.“Even though Wagner gets referred to as a private military company, it really isn’t a completely private military company. It’s really a creature of the Russian military intelligence agency,” said Kimberly Marten, a professor at Barnard College and Columbia University.  Experts said that Putin’s admission means Russia will have no way of denying responsibility for Wagner’s abuses in Africa and other parts of the world.  “The Wagner Group’s exploitative business and security model, which involves rapacious economic policies and atrocities against civilians, is now attributable to the Russian state,” said Brahimi of the Atlantic Council. “The veil has been lifted and Putin will have to personally own the predation in north and sub-Saharan Africa.”",[]

But police and Gauteng Province Premier Panyaza Lesufi later said the number of deaths had been confirmed as 16 after a recount of the bodies.“It’s not a nice scene at all ... It’s painful, emotionally draining and tragic,” Lesufi, who visited the scene, was quoted as saying in news reports.Teams were searching the area looking for other casualties deep into the night. The bodies of the victims remained lying on the ground hours after the leak was reported around 8 p.m. as emergency services waited for forensic investigators and pathologists to arrive to process the scene. The bodies were still there at 3 a.m.“We can’t move anybody. The bodies are still where they are on the ground,” said emergency services spokesman William Ntladi.A forensic investigator was seen covering the body of a small child with a blanket. Another body could be seen covered in a white cloth with a shoe sticking out. It lay under a strip of yellow police tape cordoning off the area.Police said the three children killed were aged 1, 6 and 15. Two people were taken to the hospital for treatment, police said.Boksburg is the city where 41 people died after a truck carrying liquefied petroleum gas got stuck under a bridge and exploded on Christmas Eve.People huddle around a fire for warmth in Boksburg, South Africa, on Thursday.Themba Hadebe / APNtladi said Wednesday’s deaths were caused by a nitrate gas that leaked from a gas cylinder being kept in a shack. He said the cannister had emptied out in the leak and teams were able to begin going over an area stretching out 100 yards from the cyclinder to check for more casualties.Investigators were searching through narrow alleys between shacks, cast into darkness by the lack of streetlights — a common situation in the deeply impoverished informal settlements found in and around South Africa’s cities. Six police cars, an armored vehicle and one ambulance were parked at the entrance to the Angelo settlement.Ntladi said the information authorities had indicated the cylinder that caused the leak was being used by illegal miners to separate gold from dirt and rock.Lesufi, the Gauteng premier, tweeted videos of the dusty inside of a shack where at least four gas cylinders can be seen on metal stands. The video also shows what Lesufi said was the cylinder responsible for the leak lying on the floor next to the entrance of the shack.Authorities didn’t say if the illegal miners they believed to be responsible for the gas leak were among the casualties.Illegal mining is rife in the gold-rich areas around Johannesburg, where miners go into closed off and disused mines to search for any deposits left over.Mining fatalities underground are also common and the South African government department responsible for mining announced recently that at least 31 illegal miners were believed to have died in a gas explosion in a disused mine in the city of Welkom in central South Africa. The cause was methane gas, the mining department said.Wednesday’s tragedy was likely to stoke more anger at illegal miners, who are often migrants from neighboring countries, operate in organized gangs and are blamed for bringing crime into neighborhoods.Violence against illegal miners erupted last year and raged for days in an area west of Johannesburg after a group of 80 men, some of whom were believed to be illegal miners, were charged with gang raping eight women who were working on a TV shoot at a disused mine.",[]

Some regional lawmakers frame the issue as an almost existential battle to save African values and sovereignty, which they say have been battered by Western pressure to capitulate on gay rights.The draft of Kenya’s Family Protection Bill, seen by Reuters, mirrors many aspects of the Ugandan law, which was signed by President Yoweri Museveni at the end of May to the dismay of the LGBTQ community, human rights campaigners and Western capitals.Gay sex is punishable by at least 10 years in jail under the proposed Kenyan law, while “aggravated homosexuality,” which includes gay sex with a minor or disabled person or when a terminal disease is passed on, brings the death penalty.“It is a hateful piece of legislation that will truly make the lives of queer Kenyans unbearable if passed,” said Annette Atieno of the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission campaign group.Spokespeople for the Kenyan presidency and government didn’t respond to requests for comment about the proposed bill.In South Sudan, parliamentary spokesperson John Agany told Reuters that an anti-LGBTQ law with the same content as the Ugandan legislation was being drafted and would be put to a vote “very soon.” He didn’t elaborate on the bill, and the Juba government didn’t respond to a request for comment.Meanwhile, Tanzanian lawmaker Jacqueline Ngonyani said she planned to introduce a private motion in parliament later this year to clamp down on gay activity in an attempt to “control the ongoing moral decay.”“If these (gay) people increase, this will be the end of generation,” she added. “This is the same as drugs do to our youth.”Asked whether she had specific punishments in mind, Ngonyani said she would not share anything until she was advised by legal experts.Tanzania’s minister of constitutional and legal affairs, Damas Ndumbaro, said there was little room to tighten existing colonial-era laws against homosexuality, though.“Do they want 100 years in prison while we already have a life sentence?” he told Reuters. “Let us review why the problem is persisting,” he said, referring to gay activity. “The government is still collecting opinions on how to solve the problem.”'Promoting' homosexuality: 5 yearsThe Kenyan anti-gay bill is being vetted by a parliamentary committee, which can then refer it to the full chamber for a vote. Officials have given no indication of the possible timeline.The LGBTQ community fears the worst, three rights groups told Reuters.In a debate in parliament initiated by Ali in March about whether to ban speech or publications that promote same-sex relations, more than 20 lawmakers spoke out against LGBTQ rights and none in support. Several called for legislation to strengthen penalties for same-sex acts, including the deputy majority leader, who said gay sex could be punished by hanging.",[]

To his dismay, urgently needed grain and oil have disappeared again for millions caught in a standoff between Ethiopia’s government, the United States and United Nations over what U.S. officials say may be the biggest theft of food aid on record.“I have no words to describe our suffering,” Tesfa said.As the U.S. and U.N. demand that Ethiopia’s government yield its control over the vast aid delivery system supporting one-sixth of the country’s population, they have taken the dramatic step of suspending their food aid to Africa’s second-most populous nation until they can be sure it won’t be stolen by Ethiopian officials and fighters.Almost three months have passed since the aid suspension in parts of the country, and reports are emerging of the first deaths from starvation during the pause. At the earliest, aid to the northern Tigray region will return in July, the U.S. and U.N. say, and to the rest of the country at some point after that when reforms in aid distribution allow.Tesfa, who lives in a school compound with hundreds of others displaced by the war in Tigray, laughed when asked how many meals he eats a day. “The question is a joke,” he said. “We often go to sleep without food.”In interviews with The Associated Press, which first reported the massive theft of food aid, officials with U.S. and U.N. aid agencies, humanitarian organizations and diplomats offered new findings on the countrywide diversion of aid to military units and markets. That included allegations that some senior Ethiopian officials were extensively involved.The discovery in March of enough stolen food aid to feed 134,000 people for a month in a single Tigray town is just a glimpse of the scale of the theft that the U.S., Ethiopia’s largest humanitarian donor, is trying to grasp. The food meant for needy families was found instead for sale in markets or stacked at commercial flour mills, still marked with the U.S. flag.Sacks of food earmarked for the Tigray and Afar regions in a warehouse of the World Food Programme in Semera, Ethiopia in 2022.APThe implications for the U.S. are global. Proving it can detect and stop the theft of aid paid for by U.S. taxpayers is vital at a time when the Biden administration is fighting to maintain public support for aid to corruption-plagued Ukraine.At a private meeting last week in Ethiopia, U.S. aid officials told international partners that this could be the largest-ever diversion of food aid in any country, aid workers said. In an interview with the AP, a senior official with the U.S. Agency for International Development said the exact amount of food aid stolen may never be known.Donated medical supplies also were stolen, according to a Western diplomat and U.N. official who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.With USAID giving Ethiopia’s government $1.8 billion in humanitarian assistance since 2022, a delay in providing food aid causes widespread pain. Millions of people went hungry during the war while food stocks were looted, burned and withheld by combatants, and U.N. investigators have warned of possible starvation-linked war crimes.Now the hunger is being traced to corruption.Preliminary findings released this month by Tigray regional authorities said they have tracked the theft of more than 7,000 metric tons of donated wheat — or 15 million pounds — in their region, taken by federal and regional authorities and others. The findings did not specify the time period. Other regions have yet to report amounts.Ethiopia’s government dismisses as harmful “propaganda” the suggestion that it bears primary responsibility for the disappearance of aid in Tigray and other regions, but it has agreed to a joint investigation with the U.S. while the U.N.’s World Food Program carries out a separate probe.The way that Western aid officials “distance themselves from the accusations by linking the alleged problem only to government institutions and procedures is absolutely unacceptable and very contrary to the reality on the ground,” government spokesman Legesse Tulu told reporters earlier this month. He and other government spokespeople did not immediately respond to messages from the AP.Aid workers say humanitarian agencies have long tolerated a degree of corruption by government officials. Provision of aid in Ethiopia has been heavily politicized for decades, including during the devastating famine of the 1980s, when the then-communist regime blocked assistance to areas controlled by rebel groups.The senior USAID official told the AP that the latest theft of U.S. and U.N. food aid included the manipulation of beneficiary lists that the Ethiopian government has insisted on controlling, looting by Ethiopian government and Tigray forces and forces from neighboring Eritrea, and the diversion of massive amounts of donated wheat to commercial flour mills in at least 63 sites.A former Tigray official said government workers often inflate beneficiary numbers and take the extra grain for themselves, a practice that two officials with international organizations working in Ethiopia called widespread elsewhere in the country.Numerous officials accused WFP of simply dropping off rations in the middle of towns, where much of the aid was looted by forces from Eritrea.An Ethiopian woman scoops up portions of yellow split peas to be allocated to waiting families in the town of Agula, in 2021.Ben Curtis / AP fileThere were also signs that people whom the USAID official described only as “market actors” were forcing hungry families to surrender food aid they received — something that WFP suspects as well.In Ethiopia, which has a history of deadly hunger, “zero” of the 6 million people in Tigray received food aid in May after the pause in donations by the U.S. and U.N., according to a U.N. memo seen by the AP. That’s unprecedented, it said.With 20 million people across Ethiopia dependent on such aid, plus more than 800,000 refugees from Somalia and elsewhere, independent humanitarian groups warn that even a quick resolution to the dispute could see many people starve to death.In the U.N. food agency’s first extensive public comments, the WFP regional director for East Africa, Michael Dunford, acknowledged possible “shortcomings” in its monitoring of aid distribution.“We accept that we could have done better,” he told the AP this week. But until now, Dunford said, “it’s been very much the Ethiopian government that was managing” the process.For USAID’s part, the senior agency official cited a range of reasons that U.S. officials missed the extent of the aid theft for so long. The war blocked the agency’s ground access to the Tigray region for 20 months. Elsewhere in the country, COVID restrictions and security concerns limited USAID’s oversight, the official said.Some Republican and Democratic lawmakers said the rare countrywide suspension of aid showed USAID is taking the theft of U.S. aid with appropriate seriousness. Asked if he was concerned about USAID oversight, a senior Democrat, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, said, “I’m concerned about the ways in which the Ethiopian military and government may have systematically diverted food that was meant for hungry Ethiopians.”U.S. and U.N. officials said they were working to limit — or end — Ethiopian government officials’ role in the aid system.“We’re taking back all the control over the commodities,” Dunford said. “The entire supply chain, from the time that we receive the food in the country to the time it’s in the hands of the beneficiaries.” Plans include third-party distribution, real-time third-party monitoring and biometric registration of beneficiaries, he said.The U.S. government wants Ethiopia’s government to remove itself from the compilation of beneficiary lists and the transport, warehousing and distribution of aid, according to a briefing memo by donors seen by the AP.The senior USAID official said Ethiopia’s government has committed to cooperate on reforms, but “we have not yet seen the specific reforms in place that would allow us to resume aid.”Civilians, again, are suffering.Ethiopia’s harvest season is over and the lean season is approaching. The U.N. humanitarian agency has privately expressed fears of “mass starvation” in remote parts of Tigray, according to an assessment made in April and seen by the AP. Another assessment in May cited reports of 20 people dying of starvation in Samre, a short drive from the Tigray capital, Mekele.Tigray’s main hospital reported a 28% increase in the number of children admitted for malnutrition from March to April. At the hospital in Axum town, the increase was 96%.“It is a good day if we manage to eat one meal,” said Berhane Haile, another of the thousands of war-displaced people going hungry.",[]

The people on the boat are urgently asking for help.”Passengers told Alarm Phone that the ship’s captain had abandoned the boat. “Three people have died. The boat is at sea for three days. The people have no food, water and fuel left. The boat is stationary and highly overcrowded. Immediate assistance is required,” the email read.“The engine stopped working completely, the situation is bad, the children are crying. ... Water entered the underneath deck.” An unnamed woman making distress callNo rescue was launched, and the boat was left to drift for three more days, even as Maltese authorities received dozens of emails and calls from its occupants and aid organizations begging for help, emails and transcripts of conversations obtained by NBC News show. So the passengers aboard the vessel, which first came to Alarm Phone’s notice when it was on the edge of the country’s huge search and rescue zone, drifted through Maltese waters until it finally entered Italian waters. NBC News was unable to confirm that at least three people on the overcrowded fishing boat died.The vessel’s fraught journey is part of a persistent problem in the Mediterranean: the apparent flouting of international maritime law by European states, which sometimes refuse to rescue migrant ships in distress. While the obligation of ships to go to the aid of vessels in distress is enshrined in tradition and in international treaties, as a signatory of the 1979 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, Malta had a specific legal obligation to intervene in this case, said Ainhoa Velasco, an expert of international maritime law at the University of Southampton in the U.K.Malta is required to “use search and rescue units and other available facilities” to assist those in distress and to “coordinate search and rescue operations with those of neighboring states,” Velasco said. Still, it has rejected 2004 amendments explicitly stipulating that states provide assistance to “disembarking persons found in distress at sea.”Clues to Malta’s possible reluctance to take in migrants are in its location and size. The densely populated island north and east of the Libyan coast and about 100 miles south of the Italian island of Sicily has taken in the fewest migrants of the European Union’s 27 countries — just 45 asylum-seekers in all of 2022. With a population similar to that of Wyoming, at around half-million people, Malta ranks 11th in population per capita in the E.U. Meanwhile, the number of people trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean is growing. Last year, more than 250,000 set sail from Turkey and the northern coast of Africa to seek asylum or to migrate to Europe, the most since 2017, according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency. So far this year, 1,090 migrants have disappeared during the crossing, IOM data shows. That compares to 2,366 who vanished in all of 2022 and 2,062 in 2021. Malta’s search and rescue zone lies in the path of tens of thousands of people fleeing economic, political and social hardship every year. The vast area is one of 13 such zones in the world’s oceans, as defined in the 1979 convention. It covers 100,000 square miles, nearly 800 times Malta’s size. While it is a huge area to police, Malta has refused to hand over some of it to Italy, as Italian politicians have suggested. ‘Children are crying’“The engine stopped working completely, the situation is bad, the children are crying,” an unnamed woman says in a distress call to Alarm Phone, according to a transcript. The call was received about 12 hours after the first email to the Malta Rescue Coordination Center, the charity said. “Water entered the underneath deck,” the woman also says.The recorded call was one of 27 from passengers aboard the ship that Alarm Phone says it received in the three days it spent tracking the vessel. NBC News has received transcripts of 13 of the calls, which were mostly in Arabic but also in English.Alarm Phone, which operates with volunteers in Europe and Africa who communicate with migrants crossing the Mediterranean, said it sent over 21 emails to Maltese authorities but got no response. Maltese authorities never responded and hung up on their calls, the group said.Sea-Watch, a German nongovernmental organization that conducts search and rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean Sea, deployed its reconnaissance aircraft at 2 p.m. Central European Daylight Time (8 a.m. ET) on April 9. It located the vessel in international waters between Greece and Malta, heading slowly toward Italy.  Maltese authorities this year returned this fishing boat loaded with hundreds of migrants to Libya, where many were subsequently imprisoned, four rescue groups say.Consolidated Rescue Group / via APNBC News was not able to confirm the accounts given to Alarm Phone and Sea-Watch. Emails showed Maltese officials’ exchanging emails with Sea-Watch and two nearby merchant oil tankers: Malta-registered FMT URLA and Liberia-registered Pericles. The ships’ management did not respond to requests for comment. It is customary for vessels that spot ships in distress to wait for instructions from coordination centers in charge of areas before they initiate any rescue efforts.Alarm Phone said that after it received multiple emergency calls from people onboard, it sent its first alert to rescue centers in Malta, Greece and Italy at 12:50 a.m. and also to Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Frontex did not respond to requests for comment.“People are in distress,” Alarm Phone said in its first email to the Malta Rescue Coordination Center. “We urgently ask you to start a rescue operation!”Five hours later, Alarm Phone sent an email to the Maltese coast guard saying the ship did not have a captain and had run out of drinking water and food.“One of the three people who jumped overboard and, pulled by a rope, is unconscious,” a woman says in a separate distress call, according to a transcript. Two children can be heard crying in the background in another call from April 9. “Yes, we are investigating and working on this case,” the unnamed duty officer of the Maltese Rescue Coordination Center said in a call heard by NBC News, when Sea-Watch contacted Malta at 3:23 p.m. the same day.Shortly later, at 4 p.m., Alarm Phone wrote: “One person is unconscious. The engine is no longer functional.” Meanwhile, the Sea-Watch reconnaissance aircraft spotted the oil tankers FMT URLA and Pericles, relayed the migrant ship’s location to them and reminded personnel of their obligation to help under international law.According to the emails given to NBC News, both ships refused, saying Malta had instructed them to only provide supplies. “RCC Malta advised us to proceed to its position and advised us to supply fuel to the fishing boat. There is no advice regarding rescue,” FMT URLA radioed the Sea-Watch aircraft at 3:11 p.m. on April 9. “Can you just contact now to RCC Malta? Please! Please! Please!” it said, according to a call recording between the ship and Sea-Watch.Instead of sending aid or helping evacuate the fishing vessel, Malta instructed the vessels in an email sent to Pericles at around 5 p.m. to “stand by and await further instructions.” Pericles’ captain told Sea-Watch around 9 p.m. that Malta had strictly instructed the ship to report only to it.So the overcrowded boat was left in the high seas without a captain and with a malfunctioning engine, making steering nearly impossible, according to transcripts of distress messages purportedly received by Alarm Phone. Water flooded the lower deck and people rushed to the top, drenched and facing the brunt of the chilling wind.“The children shiver with cold,” a woman said at around 8 p.m. As the hours passed, the boat continued to drift without a rescue attempt’s being launched.The Armed Forces of Malta said in a statement in response to a request for comment: “Written communication received by the AFM from the ship captain providing duty of care confirms that no rescue was requested by the people on board.” It was not clear which ship captain the statement was referring to, and representatives from Malta did not respond to several requests for follow-up comment.Malta’s, FMT URLA’s and Pericles’ responses fell far short of what was required of them, Velasco said.“Supplying fresh water or offering fuel in those circumstances is clearly insufficient and inadequate,” she said.Eventually, on April 12, when the ship drifted into Italian waters, Italy’s coast guard dispatched rescue vessels and brought the starving migrants to its shores.",[]

By the ninth day of fighting, he told his family they had to go. He managed to secure an additional $400 from a distant relative, enough for four seats on a bus to the border, with his sister, Talya, sitting on his aunt’s lap for the entire 18-hour ride. “We realized that even if we’re going to be living in the streets, we need to get out.

Nabil Abdalla, a spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces, told The Associated Press that the move is a protest against the Rapid Support Forces’ “repeated violations” of the humanitarian cease-fire, including their continued occupation of hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in the capital, Khartoum.Sudan descended into chaos after fighting erupted in mid-April between the military, led by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.

The toll could be much higher, the medical group had previously said.Abdalla, the spokesman, said the military wants to ensure that the terms of a U.S.-Saudi-brokered truce “be fully implemented” before discussing further steps. He did not elaborate.Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan cheers with soldiers as he visits some of their positions in Khartoum in a photo released Tuesday. Sudan's Armed Forces via AFP - Getty ImagesOn May 21, both sides signed a cease-fire agreement allowing for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the restoration of essential services destroyed in the clashes. They also agreed to stop the looting of residential properties and humanitarian aid, as well as the taking over of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals and power plants.There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia or the United States. So far, there have been seven declared cease-fires, all of which have been violated to some extent.Responding to the military’s move, the RSF said it “unconditionally backs the Saudi-U.S. initiative.”Two other senior military officials said the army sent a letter to the Saudi and American mediators detailing what they called the RSF violations. They said the military delegation was still in the venue of the talks in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah.One of the officials said the decision was prompted by the mediators’ efforts to move to the next stage of negotiations without “fully implementing the terms” of the humanitarian cease-fire. That stage includes a long-term cease-fire and engaging in negotiations to settle the disputes between the two sides, he said.Both senior officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.On Tuesday, the military released footage that showed Burhan inspecting troops. The army chief warned that the military would resort to “full lethal force” if the RSF “doesn’t respond to the voice of reason.” The military’s aircrafts were also seen flying over the capital.Residents, meanwhile, reported clashes late Tuesday in parts of Khartoum and its neighboring city of Omdurman.Both sides traded blame for violating the cease-fire.The military’s move came two days after the sides agreed to extend the shaky cease-fire for five more days, after Washington and Riyadh signaled impatience with persistent truce violations.In a joint statement Sunday, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia called out both warring sides for specific breaches of a weeklong truce rather than issue another general appeal to respect agreements.The statement said the military continued to carry out airstrikes, while the RSF was still occupying people’s homes and seizing properties. Fuel, money, aid supplies and vehicles belonging to a humanitarian convoy were stolen, with theft occurring both in areas controlled by the military and by the RSF, it added.Men sit outside a burned-out bank branch in southern Khartoum on May 24.

It also decrees a 20-year sentence for “promoting” homosexuality.“The Ugandan president has today legalized state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia,” said Clare Byarugaba, a Ugandan rights activist.President Joe Biden called the move “a tragic violation” of human rights and said Washington would evaluate the implications of the law “on all aspects of U.S. engagement with Uganda.”“We are considering additional steps, including the application of sanctions and restriction of entry into the United States against anyone involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption,” he said.A presidency photo of Museveni showed him signing the law with a golden pen at his desk. The 78-year-old has called homosexuality a “deviation from normal” and urged lawmakers to resist “imperialist” pressure.A local organization, Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, and 10 other individuals later filed a complaint against the law at the constitutional court, one of the petitioners, Busingye Kabumba, told Reuters.Museveni had sent the original bill passed in March back, asking parliament to tone down some provisions. But his ultimate approval was not seen as in doubt in a conservative country where anti-LGBTQ attitudes have hardened in recent years, in part due to campaigning by Western evangelical church groups.Uganda receives billions of dollars in foreign aid each year and could now face adverse measures from donors and investors, as happened with a similar bill nine years ago.Reprisals?The bill’s sponsor, Asuman Basalirwa, told reporters that parliament speaker Anita Among’s U.S. visa was canceled after the law was signed. Among and the U.S. Embassy in Uganda did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In a joint statement, the U.S.’s flagship HIV/AIDS program, PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS said the law put Uganda’s anti-HIV fight “in grave jeopardy.”Dominic Arnall, chief executive of Open for Business, a coalition of companies that includes Google and Microsoft, said the group was deeply disappointed and the law ran counter to Ugandans’ economic interests.The U.N. human rights body declared itself “appalled.”Uganda’s move could encourage lawmakers in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania seeking similar measures.“What a leader we’ve in Africa!” tweeted George Kaluma, a Kenyan member of parliament who submitted an anti-LGBTQ bill in April.“Kenya is following you in this endeavour to save humanity.”The inclusion of the death penalty for offenses like transmitting HIV has drawn particular outrage internationally.Existing Ugandan law calls for a maximum 10-year sentence for intentionally transmitting HIV and does not apply when the person who contracted the infection was aware of their sexual partner’s HIV status.By contrast, the new law makes no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission and contains no exception based on awareness of HIV status.The amended version of the bill, adopted earlier this month after Museveni returned it to parliament, stipulated that merely identifying as LGBTQ is not a crime and revised a measure that obliged people to report homosexual activity to only require reporting when a child is involved.'Like apartheid' LGBTQ Ugandans called those changes useless, saying law enforcement regularly exceeds its legal authorities to harass them. They said passage of the bill in March unleashed a wave of arrests, evictions and mob attacks.The issue has been a long-running one in Uganda.A less restrictive 2014 anti-LGBTQ law was struck down by a Ugandan court on procedural grounds, after Western governments had initially suspended some aid, imposed visa restrictions and curtailed security cooperation.In 2009, a bill dubbed “kill the gays” for initially proposing executing homosexuals was introduced after a conference in Kampala drew representatives from the United States including prominent anti-gay evangelical Scott Lively.As well as religious campaigning, Africa’s anti-LGBTQ attitudes also have their roots in the colonial era, including an anti-sodomy section of Britain’s penal code. By the time the UK legalized same-sex acts in 1967, many former colonies were independent and did not inherit the legal change.“To reduce any kind of human being, irrespective of their sexuality, to a death sentence based on who they identify as and how they choose to live their lives is something that we should all feel very ashamed about as a continent,” said South African filmmaker Lerato.“We can liken this to apartheid if not worse.”",[]

Ethiopia has been asking for the prince's remains and other treasures to be returned for the last 150 years.Fasil Minas, a descendent of the Abyssinian royal family and a relative of Alemayehu, told the BBC: “We want his remains back as a family and as Ethiopians because that is not the country he was born in.”But the palace said this week that this wasn't possible as it would disturb other human remains buried nearby.""The Dean and Canons of Windsor are very sensitive to the need to honour the memory of Prince Alemayehu,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to NBC News on Tuesday.""However, they have been advised that it is very unlikely that it would be possible to exhume the remains without disturbing the resting place of a substantial number of others in the vicinity,"" the statement said.The Ethiopian Embassy in London is welcome to keep visiting the grave to pay respects, the statement added — but historians said the palace should do more to take responsibility for its past.Staff from the Ethiopian Embassy in London pay tribute to the late prince outside St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in 2019.@EthioEmbassyUK / Twitter""This is such an emotional issue because it reminds everyone of Alemayehu’s plight — a child stuck in a foreign land, never allowed to go home,"" Andrew Heavens, author of a new book on Alemayehu and the British raid on Abyssinia titled ""The Prince and the Plunder,"" told NBC News. ""Emotionally, most people who get to know Alemayehu’s story feel his remains should be returned. He made it so clear before he died that he wanted to go back,"" Heavens said.The palace could do more to show Ethiopia exactly why the prince's body can't be removed, Heavens added. Alemayehu was the son of the emperor of Abyssinia, Tewodros II, a Coptic Christian ruler who had taken missionaries and British government officials captive after Britain refused to assist him in wars with mostly Muslim neighboring countries.In December 1867, Britain launched an expedition of 13,000 soldiers and 40,000 animals, including 44 elephants trained to pull huge artillery guns, according to the National Army Museum in London, to free the hostages.Alemayehu was an orphan and Captain Speedy, left, became his guardian.V&A Images / Getty ImagesIt took until April for them to reach the Abyssinian capital, Maqdala. More than 500 Abyssinians were killed and thousands injured in a 90-minute battle — some estimates are much higher and no complete contemporary record exists.British forces sustained two deaths, with 18 soldiers injured. Tewodros subsequently killed himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria.It took 15 elephants and around 200 mules to carry all the wealth the British looted from Maqdala. Alemayehu's mother, Empress Tiruwork Wube, intended to travel to England with her son but died on the journey.Queen Victoria took an interest in Alemayehu and arranged for him to study at elite schools, before he was sent to the military training academy at Sandhurst. He left after less than a year for the English city of Leeds, where he died of pleurisy — inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs — at age 18 in 1879.Victoria wrote in her diary: ""Very grieved and shocked to hear by telegram, that good Alemayehu had passed away this morning. It is too sad! All alone, in a strange country, without a single person or relative, belonging to him."" He was buried in the catacombs of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.For Jeremiah Garsha, an expert in the looting of human remains at University College Dublin, originally from California, there is no doubt that Alemayehu was stolen.""He was, he was kidnapped,"" he said. ""You have a minor coming to another country as an orphan after his mother dies and then he himself dies at 18 — something should feel wrong about that. He's looted as well, like all the other curios and treasures that were taken.""The British obsession with Africa at the time created a huge market for stolen goods. This curiosity extended from ceremonial shields and religious items to living Black African people.""You wouldn't kidnap a white child; Victoria's not going to end up with a child from [London suburb] Camden Town — there has to be a racial element, the foreignness for this prince to come and be at the palace,"" Garsha said.Many of the treasures that were taken remain in the British Museum, which has been discussing the possible return of certain items with Ethiopian officials since 2019.Several other countries, including Benin and Greece, have long petitioned the British government for the return of items that they consider stolen during the colonial era.",[]

Almost 30 people have died in the two previous days of fighting, according to activists.The war broke out in Khartoum after disputes over plans for the RSF to be integrated into the army and over the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal to shift Sudan towards democracy following decades of conflict-ridden autocracy.The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announced late on Friday more than $100 million to Sudan and countries receiving fleeing Sudanese, including much-needed food and medical aid.“It’s hard to convey the extent of the suffering occurring right now in Sudan,” said agency head Samantha Power.",[]

Al Arabiya television reported heavy clashes in central Khartoum.“There were heavy air strikes near us in Saliha that shook the doors of the house,” said Salma Yassin, a teacher in Omdurman.The fighting has killed hundreds of people, sent 200,000 into neighbouring countries as refugees, displaced another 700,000 inside Sudan triggering a humanitarian catastrophe and threatens to draw in outside powers and destabilise the region.The number of people killed in fighting on Friday and Saturday in Geneina, capital of West Darfur, reached more than 100, including the imam of the city’s old mosque, the Darfur Bar Association said in a statement.The local rights group blamed the killings, looting and arson in Geneina, where hundreds died in violence last month, on attacks by armed groups on motorbikes and the RSF. The RSF has denied responsibility for the unrest.Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, had shared power after a 2021 coup that itself followed a 2019 uprising that ousted veteran Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir.But they fell out over the terms and timing of a planned transition to civilian rule and neither man has shown he is ready for concessions, with the army controlling air power and the RSF dug deep into city districts.Truce deals have been repeatedly broken but the United States and Saudi Arabia are mediating talks in Jeddah aimed at securing a lasting ceasefire.“You don’t know how long this war will continue ... The house became unsafe and we don’t have enough money to travel out of Khartoum. Why are we paying the price of Burhan and Hemedti’s war?” said Yassin, the teacher.On Thursday the sides agreed a “declaration of principles” to protect civilians and secure humanitarian access, but with Sunday’s discussions due to address monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for that deal, the fighting has not let up.",[]

Using a diplomatic term referring to a formal complaint, it added that it had Brigety, who has served as ambassador since last year, had been “demarched.”  The ministry did not directly deny Brigety’s claim in a briefing to local journalists on Thursday, that Washington was “confident” the Russian cargo vessel Lady R. had uploaded weapons and ammunition from South Africa in December.Calling it “fundamentally unacceptable,” Brigety said he “would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion.”  The Lady R. was at the South African naval base at the time Brigety suggested, and is tied to a company sanctioned by the U.S. for transporting weapons for the Russian government and aiding its war effort, according to the Associated Press.After the meeting with South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor on Friday, Brigety said on Twitter that he was “grateful,” for the opportunity to “correct any misimpressions left by my public remarks.”  In a separate statement Friday, Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had spoken with Pandor on Friday. “Secretary Blinken underscored the importance of the U.S.- South Africa strategic partnership and reiterated cooperation on shared priorities, including health, trade, and energy,” he said.   South Africa’s head of public diplomacy, Clayson Monyela, insisted in a statement posted to Twitter Saturday that Pretoria had not breached its declared neutrality in the Ukraine conflict.Monyela said his government’s committee for arms control “is on record saying they’ve not approved any sale of arms to Russia, related to the period or incident in question,” adding that any assertion that South Africa sold arms or is arming Russia, was “factually incorrect.”South Africa’s own arms control laws stipulate that the country “will not trade in conventional arms with states engaged in repression, aggression or terrorism.”His comments came after the office of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday said in a statement Thursday that Brigety's remarks were “disappointing” and “counterproductive” and they undermined an agreement between the U.S. and South Africa to conduct an independent investigation into the matter.   Asked about the allegations in South Africa’s National Assembly on Thursday, Ramaphose said there were “being looked into.”South Africa abstained from condemning the Russian invasion in a United Nations vote last year and said it would take a neutral stance on the war, while calling for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The country also hosted Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov for talks in January, and allowed Russian and Chinese warships to use its waters for joint naval drills that coincided with the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine in February. Their historical relationship is predicated on the Soviet Union’s support for the ruling African National Congress when it was still a liberation group fighting to end apartheid.",[]

He told reporters that Washington had serious concerns about the docking of the ship at a South African naval port and had raised those concerns directly with multiple South African officials.“We have been quite clear and have not parsed words about any country taking steps to support Russia’s illegal and brutal war in Ukraine, and we will continue to engage with partners and countries on this topic,” Patel said.Asked about South Africa’s pledge of an investigation, he said “it would certainly be a welcome step.”The U.S. Embassy in South Africa and the U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.Brigety made the remarks to journalists following his return to Pretoria after accompanying a high-level South African delegation to the United States to address concerns about South Africa’s relationship with Russia.South Africa’s presidency said that the issue of the suspected arms shipment had already been discussed with U.S. officials who had agreed to let an investigation run its course, and that no evidence had yet been provided by Washington.“The Ambassador’s remarks undermine the spirit of cooperation and partnership that characterized the recent engagements between US government officials and a South African official delegation,” the presidency said in its statement.South Africa conducted joint naval exercises with Russia and China in February — calling it routine — which the U.S. and other Western powers expressed concern about at the time.",[]

One possibility was to establish a mechanism to monitor a cease-fire that includes Sudanese and foreign observers, “but that has to be negotiated,” he said.Talks on entrenching the cease-fire could take place in either Saudi Arabia or South Sudan, he said, adding that the former may be easier logistically since it has close ties to both sides.But even talks in Saudi Arabia has challenges, he said, since each side needs safe passage through territory of the other to reach talks. “That is very difficult in a situation where there is a lack of trust,” he said.The battle between the generals for control has plunged Sudan into chaos.Tens of thousands of Sudanese fled the fighting, especially in Khartoum and Omdurman. Many headed to the norther borders with Egypt or to Port Sudan. Foreign governments also evacuated their citizens from Sudan.Many fear the fighting could spiral further, dragging in others in a country where multiple armed groups exist and have fought several civil wars over the past decade.“There is a risk, that if this continues, that in the shadow of this war between two militaries, other forces, tribal forces, political forces are being mobilized and would take sides in an opportunistic way,” Perthes said.",[]

But their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government and a disagreement over how the Rapid Security Forces should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee the process.The bombardments, gunbattles and sniper fire in densely populated areas have hit civilian infrastructure, including many hospitals. Khartoum, a city of 5 million people, has been transformed into a front line.  In some areas in and around the capital, residents told The Associated Press that shops were reopening and normalcy was gradually returning as the scale of fighting dwindled after the shaky truce. But in other areas, terrified residents told the AP that explosions were thundering around them and fighters were ransacking houses.Several attempts at a cease-fire have failed.Miller, of the State Department, said the U.S. continued “to call on the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to end the fighting that is endangering civilians.” He said Americans had been discouraged from traveling to Sudan.There was some good news as the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement that a “badly needed” 8-ton medical shipment consisting of surgical dressings, anesthetics and other medical supplies arrived at Port Sudan on Sunday.The Red Cross said a second plane carrying additional supplies and emergency personnel was on its way.",[]

The famous queen, who was crowned Cleopatra VII and reigned from 51 to 30 BC as its last ruler, was the direct descendent of Ptolemy I Soter, bodyguard to Alexander the Great and founder of the Greek-speaking Ptolemaic Kingdom.After her much-discussed and dramatized death — according to popular legend due to a self-inflicted snake bite — Egypt became a Roman colony.Roman writers including Plutarch and Cassius Dio, known for chronicling the Roman and Greek worlds during Cleopatra’s reign, said Cleopatra was light-skinned and of Macedonian ancestry.Other scholars have argued it is possible she could have been one-quarter Egyptian.“Egyptians did not bear the features of sub-Saharan Africans,” said Dr. Samia Al-Mirghani, former director general of the Center for Research and Conservation of Antiquities, in a statement citing evidence from anthropological studies and DNA tests.Inscriptions on ancient tombs and statues, she argued, “portrayed the [ancient] Egyptians with features as close as possible to the contemporary Egyptians. She admitted however that there was “a great diversity” among Egyptians due to the kingdom’s fluid, international nature.One of Egypt’s most famous archaeologists and twice-serving antiquities minister, Zahi Hawass, was adamant: Cleopatra was not Black.“If we see statues and forms of her father and brother, we will not find any evidence supporting this claim that she was black,” he said in a statement.Hawass added that Egypt at the time of Cleopatra’s reign ruled over the Kingdom of the Kush, also known as Nubia, in what is now Sudan and southern Egypt, with its distinctive Black African culture. “But they have no connection with the Pharaonic civilization,” he said.The creators of a petition on change.org calling for the show to be  canceled said it had more than 100,000 signatures before it was taken offline without warning. NBC News has approached Change.org to ask if the petition was taken down and, if so, the reasons why.Both Netflix and Nutopia, the production company behind “Queen Cleopatra,” did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Egyptian lawmaker Saboura al-Sayyed this week repeated an earlier call for Netflix to be banned across the country. This is not the first time the casting of Cleopatra has sparked controversy. Israeli actor Gal Godot made headlines in 2020 when she was chosen to play the role in a forthcoming movie, leading to accusations of ""whitewashing."" Writing in Variety last week, the Netflix show’s director, Tina Gharani, wrote that as a child she watched Elizabeth Taylor’s Hollywood portrayal of Cleopatra, but had always wondered about the accuracy of the casting: “I was captivated, but even then, I felt the image was not right. Was her skin really that white?”She argues that while the queen was descended from Macedonian royalty, “Cleopatra was eight generations away from these Ptolemaic ancestors, making the chance of her being white somewhat unlikely.”Gharani wrote that the casting of a Black actor was a political act, one that has seen her become the target of an online hate campaign.“Why shouldn’t Cleopatra be a melanated sister? And why do some people need Cleopatra to be white? Her proximity to whiteness seems to give her value, and for some Egyptians it seems to really matter,” she said.James, the actress playing the iconic queen, fired back at critics in a recent Twitter post featuring screengrabs of abusive comments that included a racist slur. “If you don’t like the casting, don’t watch the show,” she said.Charlene Gubash reported from Cairo, and Patrick Smith from London.",[]

All these areas are flashpoints since the war between the military and the RSF erupted on April 15.“Heavy explosions and constant gunfire are heard across Kafouri streets,” said Abdalla, a Kafouri resident who asked to be identified only by his first name for his safety.In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, a protest group reported “constant explosions” in the district of Karari early Friday. It called residents in the area to remain vigilant.The RSF has claimed that the army’s aircraft bombed its positions in Omdurman and Jabal Awliya, south of Khartoum. The military, meanwhile, accused the paramilitary force of beginning the attack. It was not possible to verify either claim.The Turkish Defense Ministry said “light weapons were fired” at a C-130 aircraft heading to Wadi Sayidna airbase, about 14 miles north of Khartoum, to evacuate Turkish civilians. The plane landed safely, the ministry said in a tweet, and no personnel were injured.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the French military evacuated dozens of employees with the U.N. and other international aid agencies Thursday night from al-Fasher, a city in Sudan’s western Darfur region, to Chad’s capital, N’Djamena, according to U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.U.N. envoy Volker Perthes remained in Sudan along with a “small” U.N. team, according to the U.N. mission in the African country.The power struggle between the Sudanese military, led by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, led by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, has dealt a harsh blow to Sudan’s hopes for a democratic transition.The rival generals came to power after a pro-democracy uprising led to the ouster of the former strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. In 2021, the generals joined forces to seize power in a coup that ousted a western-backed join military-civilian administration.The fighting has further plunged the country, especially its capital, into chaos, with tens of thousands seeking safety elsewhere. Many headed to the northern borders with Egypt, or to the city of Port Sudan on the Red Sea.Those who remain in the capital have been living in rapidly deteriorating conditions, mostly trapped inside their homes for days amid the clashes. Food, water and other services have become scarce, and electricity is cut off across much of Khartoum and other cities.The health care system is near to collapse with dozens of hospitals became out of service because of attacks, lack of staff or power. Multiple aid agencies have had to suspend operations and evacuated most if its employees out of the country.At least 512 people, including civilians and combatants, have been killed in Sudan since April 15, with another 4,200 wounded, according to the Sudanese Health Ministry. The Doctors’ Syndicate, which tracks civilian casualties, has recorded at least 303 civilians killed and 1,848 wounded.The fighting also resulted in widespread looting and destruction in the capital and elsewhere across the county. Major open-air markets, businesses and houses were stormed and looted by groups of armed men, with many blamed elements of the RSF.The Umma Party, the largest political entity in Sudan, meanwhile said in a statement that RSF elements stormed the house of the party’s leader, Mubarak al-Fadel in Amarat, one of Khartoum’s most prestigious neighborhoods.The party said al-Fadel and his family were not at home when the storming took place on April 21, the first day of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. The party said the paramilitary force damaged the house and looted the family’s gold before leaving the second day.There was no comment from the RSF, but the paramilitary force has repeatedly sought to distance itself from looting and robbery, saying they were armed men disguised in RSF uniforms.In the Darfur city of Genena, the situation remained volatile Friday, a day after armed fighters rampaged through the city, battling each other, killing dozens and looting shops and homes.“The fighting stopped but the situation is shaky,” said Dr. Salah Tour, a board member of the Doctors’ Syndicate in the West Darfur province, of which Genena is the capital.He said residents took advantage of the relative clam Friday morning and began collecting dead bodies from the streets for burial and assessing destructions and damage at their properties. The Sudanese Red Crescent also helped in collecting the bodies, he said.Fighters in RSF uniforms attacked several neighborhoods across Genena on Thursday, driving many families from their homes. The violence spiraled as tribal fighters joining the fray in the city of around half a million people near the border with Chad.Tour said the city suffers from “extremely dire shortage” of food, water, and other services amid a dayslong power outage.

Many foreign nationals remain stuck in Sudan despite an exodus marking one of the largest such evacuations since the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan in 2021. Sudanese civilians, who have been struggling to find food, water and fuel, continued to flee Khartoum on Thursday.The army late on Wednesday said its leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, had given initial approval to the plan to extend the truce for another 72 hours and to send an army envoy to the South Sudan capital, Juba, for talks.The military said the presidents of South Sudan, Kenya and Djibouti worked on a proposal that includes extending the truce and talks between the two forces, whose conflict derailed a transition to civilian democracy after a 2021 military coup.“Burhan thanked the IGAD and expressed an initial approval to that,” the army statement said.IGAD reaffirmed an earlier call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, de-escalation and a return to the negotiating table. A statement by the bloc made no mention of Juba talks.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat discussed working together to create a sustainable end to the fighting, the State Department said on Wednesday.At least 512 people have been killed and close to 4,200 wounded by the fighting since April 15.The crisis has sent growing numbers of refugees across Sudan’s borders. The U.N. refugee agency has estimated 270,000 people could flee into South Sudan and Chad alone.Thousands of people, mainly Sudanese, have been waiting at the border to cross into Egypt, Sudan’s neighbor to the north.France said on Thursday it had evacuated more people from Sudan, including Britons, Americans, Canadians, Ethiopians, Dutch, Italians and Swedes. Britain said it might not be able to continue evacuating nationals when the cease-fire ends, and they should try to reach British flights out of Sudan immediately.Mohammad Al Samman, a Syrian evacuated to Jordan by plane, expressed shock at how the violence had begun suddenly and with such intensity. “I didn’t witness this in Syria. With all the war and destruction in Syria, it didn’t happen just suddenly, Al Samman told Reuters after landing in Jordan.The conflict has limited food distribution in the vast nation, Africa’s third largest, where a third of the 46 million people were already reliant on humanitarian aid.An estimated 50,000 acutely malnourished children have had treatment disrupted due to the conflict, and those hospitals still functioning face shortages of medical supplies, power and water, according to a U.N. update on Wednesday.The Sudan Doctors’ Union said 60 out of 86 hospitals in conflict zones had stopped operating.Much of the fighting has been focused in Khartoum, where RSF fighters have embedded themselves in residential areas, and the western province of Darfur, where conflict has simmered ever since civil war erupted there two decades ago.Tension had been building for months between Sudan’s army and the RSF, which together toppled a civilian government in an October 2021 coup, two years after a popular uprising toppled long-ruling Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir.",[]

He is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.Haroun, who was head of the ruling National Congress Party, said that he and other former officials under al-Bashir had left the facility  and would take responsibility for their own protection, in a statement aired on Sudan’s Tayba TV on Tuesday, according to Reuters. Haroun said they would be willing to appear in front of the judiciary whenever it is functioning.A cease-fire between the two armed groups battling for control of Africa's third-largest country appeared to be largely holding Wednesday. The fighting has seen millions of people caught in the crossfire and sent many, including Americans, racing to flee as it threatens to spiral into a civil war.The Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces together removed al-Bashir from power during mass protests in 2019, only to later stage a coup that derailed the country's transition to democracy.As speculation swirled that the country's former leader may have been among those free from the prison, the armed forces said they had him in custody.The military said in a statement Wednesday morning that al-Bashir and other former officials had been detained at a military-run medical facility due to their health conditions ""before the rebellion broke out"" at Kober prison. Haroun was not among those named as being in custody.The army said it was sharing the whereabouts of al-Bashir and other former officials ""as a deterrent to the massive disinformation that some rebel media microphones have been promoting to distract people.""Citing two sources at the hospital, Reuters reported that al-Bashir had been moved from Kober prison to a military hospital before heavy fighting broke out there on April 15. The army, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, had accused the RSF of donning military uniforms and attacking the prison, according to The Associated Press, saying they released inmates and looted the facility. The RSF, led by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, denied the allegations and claimed that the military “forcibly evacuated” the facility as part of a plan to restore al-Bashir to power, the news agency reported.NBC News has not verified the claims of either side.Haroun was one of dozens of Sudanese officials arrested in 2019 after al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for three decades, was ousted in a military coup amid a popular uprising.The resource-rich yet impoverished nation then saw Burhan, the country’s top commander and de facto ruler, and his former deputy, Dagalo, team up to orchestrate the coup that overthrew the government in October 2021.Their alliance has since fallen apart over how to make the transition to civilian rule, with the tensions erupting into armed conflict earlier this month.More than 450 people have been killed in the fighting since, according to the World Health Organization, including at least two Americans.The United States military evacuated embassy personnel over the weekend, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that the U.S. was weighing whether to resume diplomatic presence in Sudan to assist American nationals racing to escape the fighting.

Both leaders have agreed — but the news may only offer a temporary halt to an unpredictable clash.Here’s what to know about the fragile and complex situation in Africa’s third-largest country, from its warring generals to Russia’s Wagner mercenary group.The rival factions?The conflict is between the two powerful military leaders who had joined forces to thwart the country’s move toward democracy but have since turned into bitter rivals.Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan and his former deputy and current rival, Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.Getty; AFPIt pits the Sudanese military, controlled by the country’s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo — a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti — who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Both men were leaders in a counterinsurgency against an uprising in Sudan’s Darfur region, a conflict that in 2005 saw dictator Omar al-Bashir become the world’s first sitting leader to be indicted by the International Criminal Court on suspicion of genocide.Then they were part of the military establishment that helped oust al-Bashir in 2019 after widespread popular unrest, raising hopes for democracy after his 30 years in power.But the two generals have remained major political figures in the extremely unstable years since then.They agreed to rule together in an alliance that saw the military seize power in a coup following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. The coup halted the move toward civilian rule and the armed forces have subsequently cracked down on pro-democracy activists.What led to the outbreak of fighting?The fighting of the last few days belies a complex national and international picture, in which ethnic and regional loyalties compete to control natural resources amid international influence, with major African and Middle Eastern powers joining the United States and Britain in attempting to steer the country’s political future.Hopes were raised among democracy campaigners in December when both generals signed a framework agreement with some 40 civil groups in which they promised to transition away from military rule.But now the alliance between the two military leaders has spectacularly broken down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government.Dagalo's paramilitary force began as brutal militias implicated in atrocities in the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s.Jacob Silberberg / Getty Images fileBoth sides disagree on how the RSF should be integrated into the military, a key condition of the framework agreement. The army wants the transition to happen in two years, while the RSF said it could take 10 years.Talks broke down and an April 11 deadline to sign an agreement came and went.RSF troops were posted across the country last Thursday — witnesses told Reuters that they saw a convoy of RSF vehicles including armored trucks enter Khartoum.The RSF said this was simply part of its normal duties in collaboration with the regular armed forces, but the Sudanese army issued a rare statement calling the move a “clear violation of law.”What’s the situation like on the ground?Fighting has been fierce in the capital and beyond since Saturday, with fighter jets launching airstrikes, artillery pounding and gunbattles for control of key sites such as military bases, the presidential palace and the state television building.Both sides accuse the other of being the first to shoot, but the picture is very murky and it’s unclear who might have the upper hand. Satellite images have illustrated the scale of the damage from the fighting, including here at Khartoum's international airport.AFP - Getty ImagesAn American travel writer, Lakshmi Parthasarathy, said she was awoken in Khartoum by what she thought was a thunderstorm. “It turned out it was gunshots, bombings, shelling,” she told NBC News.Residents have been forced to shelter in their homes, with shops shut and streets largely deserted.Fears are rising for the humanitarian situation in the country.An estimated 15 million people in Sudan face acute food insecurity out of a population of 46.7 million, but the U.N. World Food Program halted its work Sunday after three of its staff members were killed.And diplomatic workers have also come under fire.Blinken told reporters Tuesday that a U.S. convoy with diplomatic plates, displaying an American flag, was shot at Monday, although no one was injured.“Indiscriminate military operations have resulted in significant civilian deaths and injuries, and are recklessly endangering the Sudanese people, diplomats including U.S. personnel, and humanitarian aid workers,” he said, reiterating calls for a halt to the fighting. What are the global stakes?Washington has traditionally had limited influence in Sudan, though this began to change after al-Bashir was ousted and the country began to move toward democracy.Sudan is an important regional political player and also has strategic ports and vast natural resources, such as gold and oil, coveted at home and abroad.Neighboring Egypt has deep links with the Sudanese military, while both the military and the RSF have forged close ties to regional power players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But a growing force in recent years throughout the region has been Russia and the Kremlin-backed mercenary Wagner Group, which is also fighting in eastern Ukraine and has been linked to gold trafficking in Sudan.Earlier this year Russia finalized a deal with Sudan’s military leaders to build a naval base on the country’s Red Sea coast, where it would keep up to four ships, including nuclear-powered ones, and up to 300 troops.Dating back to 2021, the deal was waiting to be ratified by the incoming Sudanese civilian government — an outcome that now looks increasingly unlikely.“The Russians have been trying to advance relations with both of the military camps over the last three years,” said Joseph Siegle, director of research for the Africa Center of Strategic Studies, a think tank in Washington. “They’ve been mostly positive” toward Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, he said. “But they have also been especially positive toward Hemedti, who has been the one controlling the gold mines.” Russia's foreign minister met with Dagalo in Khartoum earlier this year as Moscow vies with the West for influence in Africa.AFP - Getty ImagesSudan’s economy has been deteriorating, leaving the country’s civilians facing hardship and its rulers in a precarious position looking for help from abroad. The military controls most of the country’s economy, but the RSF runs major gold mining areas, adding a financial element to a complex political crisis.“There’s 300% inflation, a contracting economy, it’s hard to get basic goods and supplies. So there’s a lot of economic pressure, and that’s the main driving force for the military to consider this transition — they just don’t have the credibility or legitimacy,” Siegle said of the faltering move toward democracy.With Sudan’s fate uncertain, so is the global fallout.“The military leadership split upends the calculations and hopes not only of the Sudanese population hoping for democracy and new infusions of foreign assistance, but also of the regional and global players pursuing sometimes competing agendas in Sudan,” said the Soufan Center, an intelligence and security consultancy, in a briefing note. Either way, it concluded: “A return to stability or civilian rule is unlikely in the near to medium term.”",[]

As heavy fighting raged into a second day, the Sudan Central Doctors’ Committee said in a tweet that at least 56 civilians had been killed and “the number of injured reached 595, including wounded soldiers, among them dozens of critical cases.”It also said it believed there were dozens of additional deaths among the Sudanese military and its partner-turned-rival, the Rapid Support Forces group, which began battling for control of the country Saturday. Volker Perthes, the United Nations special representative in Sudan said in a statement that three employees from the World Food Program, which later suspended operations in the country, were killed in clashes that erupted in Kabkabiya, North Darfur.  “My deepest condolences are with their families,” he said in a statement, adding that he was ""extremely appalled"" by reports of looting of U.N. and other humanitarian premises in Darfur. Both the military and the RSF claimed successes in social media posts Sunday, but it was unclear which side had gained the upper hand as skirmishes went on in the capital, Khartoum, as well as other parts of the country.  The Sudanese News Agency posted a statement from the Security Committee of the State of Khartoum on Saturday warning people to “stay in their homes as much as possible.“The honorable citizens should stay away from military areas and any places that could be a target for the ongoing operations,” it said.The clashes capped months of heightened tensions between the two forces that had delayed a deal with political parties to get the country back to its short-lived transition to democracy, which was derailed by a military coup in October 2021.People run past a military vehicle in Khartoum on Saturday as clashes take place in the city.AFP - Getty ImagesSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. was urging Sudan’s military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the head of the RSF, Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Degalo, to “take active measures to reduce tensions and ensure the safety of all civilians.”   “The only way forward is to return to negotiations that support the Sudanese people’s democratic aspirations,” said Blinken, who traveled from Vietnam to Japan Sunday for a meeting with foreign ministers from the Group of Seven.  His comments came after China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday that it was “closely monitoring” the situation and hoped “parties in Sudan will increase dialogue and jointly move forward the political transition process.”Meanwhile, Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its Telegram channel Saturday that it was concerned about the “dramatic events taking place in Sudan,” and it called “on the conflicting sides to show political will and restraint and to take steps toward a cease-fire immediately,” the statement said. The Wagner Group, a private military contractor with ties to the Kremlin, have operatives stationed in Sudan to support Russia’s interests in the region, according to the Associated Press, which reported that Moscow was also constructing a naval base on Sudan's east coast.

Secretary-General António Guterres, who called on Twitter for ""an immediate cessation of hostilities."" The Arab League chief, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, and African Union head, Moussa Faki Mahamat, also urged the warring parties to call a cease-fire. Later on Sunday, the leaders of Egypt and South Sudan spoke by phone and offered to mediate between the two sides in Sudan’s clashes, the Egyptian presidency said in a statement. It appeared, however, that neither side was willing to negotiate, and on Sunday gunfire was heard in the city of Bahri, according to Reuters. Drone footage captured by a U.S. traveler staying in  Khartoum showed towering clouds of smoke over the city's airport, with at least one plane seen burning. The military and the RSF had previously teamed up to co-orchestrate the coup that overthrew the government in October 2021.But the recent tensions stem from disagreement over how the RSF, headed by Gen. Dagalo, should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee the process. On Saturday, the military called for the RSF to be dismantled, describing it as a “rebellious militia.” The merger is a key condition of Sudan‘s unsigned transition agreement with political groups.The country at the crossroads of the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa borders six nations and is known for its history of military coups and civil conflicts since it gained independence in the 1950s.The U.S. placed Sudan under a trade embargo between 1993 and 2017, when the nation was designated a state sponsor of terrorism. Attempts to establish normalization since that point have been halting because of political instability, according to the State Department.A State Department spokesperson said all U.S. government workers in Sudan are “accounted for and safe.”The State Department offered this advice to American citizens in Sudan: “U.S. citizens are advised to remain sheltered in place; to attempt to stay at the lower levels of their location, remain away from windows, and attempt to keep away from the roadways; to monitor local media for updates; and to review the Department of State travel advisory for Sudan.”The spokesperson added: “Due to the uncertain security situation in Khartoum and closure of the airport, there are no plans for U.S. government-coordinated evacuation at this time. If evacuation of private U.S. citizens becomes necessary, this announcement will be made public by Travel Alert and Travel Advisory.”",[]

But the Sudan Doctor’s Syndicate added that there are many uncounted casualties, including military and RSF personnel in the western Darfur region and the northern town of Merowe.The clashes capped months of heightened tensions between the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces group. Those tensions had delayed a deal with political parties to get the country back to its short-lived transition to democracy, which was derailed by an October 2021 military coup.After a day of heavy fighting, the military ruled out negotiations with the RSF, instead calling for the dismantling of what it called a “rebellious militia.” The tough language signaled that the conflict between the former allies, who jointly orchestrated the 2021 coup, was likely to continue.The Sudan Doctor’s Syndicate did not immediately release details of where the 56 deaths occurred, but it said at least six of them were in the capital Khartoum and its sister city Omdurman. At least eight dead and 58 wounded were in the vicinity of Nyala, the capital city of the South Darfur province in the southwest.Smoke billows above residential buildings in Khartoum on Sunday.AFP - Getty ImagesThe fighting erupted early Saturday. The sound of heavy firing could be heard throughout the day across the neighborhoods in and near the capital, where the military and the RSF had massed tens of thousands of troops since the coup.Witnesses said fighters from both sides fired from armored vehicles and from machine guns mounted on pick-up trucks in densely populated areas. Some tanks were seen in Khartoum. The military said it launched strikes from planes and drones at RSF positions in and around the capital.The miliatry said in a statement late Saturday that its troops had seized all RSF bases in Omdurman, while residents reported heavy airstrikes on paramilitary positions in and around the capital continued into the night. Sounds of gunfire and explosions were still heard in several parts of Khartoum, they said.Those in Khartoum described chaotic scenes. “Fire and explosions are everywhere,” said Amal Mohamed, a doctor in a public hospital in Omdurman. “We haven’t seen such battles in Khartoum before,” said resident Abdel-Hamid Mustafa.One of the flashpoints was Khartoum International Airport. There was no formal announcement that the airport was closed, but major airlines suspended their flights.Saudi Arabia’s national airline said one of its aircraft was involved in what it called “an accident.” Video showed the plane on fire on the tarmac. Another plane also appeared to have caught fire. Flight-tracking website FlightRadar24 identified it as a Boeing 737 for SkyUp, a Kyiv, Ukraine-based airline. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Sudan Doctors’ Syndicate said earlier in the day that two civilians were killed at the Khartoum airport. Another man was shot to death in the state of North Kordofan, it said. The BBC said one of its reporters was stopped by soldiers, taken to the military headquarters and beaten.The leaders of the armed forces and the RSF traded blame over who started Saturday’s fighting and offered conflicting accounts of who was in control of key installations.Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, commander of Sudan’s military, told the Qatar-based satellite news network Al Jazeera that RSF troops first “harassed” the military south of Khartoum, triggering the clashes.Burhan accused the RSF of entering Khartoum airport and setting fire to some planes. He also said all strategic facilities including the military’s headquarters and the Republican palace, the seat of Sudan’s presidency, are under his forces’ control. He threatened to deploy more troops to Khartoum.The head of the RSF, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, accused Burhan of starting the battle by surrounding RSF troops. “This criminal, he forced this battle upon us,” he said.Dagalo told Al Jazeera that he believed the fighting would be over in “the next few days.”The RSF alleged that its forces controlled strategic locations in Khartoum and the northern city of Merowe some 215 miles northwest of the capital. The military dismissed the claims as “lies.”The fighting comes after months of escalating tensions between the generals and years of political unrest since the 2021 coup. The tensions stem from a disagreement over how the RSF, headed by Dagalo, should be integrated into the armed forces and what authority should oversee the process. The merger is a key condition of Sudan’s unsigned transition agreement with political groups.Pro-democracy activists have blamed Burhan and Dagalo for abuses against protesters across the county over the past four years, including the deadly break-up of a protest camp outside the military’s headquarters in Khartoum in June 2019 that killed over 120 protesters. Many groups have repeatedly called for holding them accountable. The RSF has long been accused of atrocities linked to the Darfur conflict.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other top diplomats expressed extreme concern over the outbreak of violence. “We urge all actors to stop the violence immediately and avoid further escalations or troop mobilizations and continue talks to resolve outstanding issues,” Blinken wrote on Twitter.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres; the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell; the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat; the Arab League chief, Ahmed Aboul Gheit; and Qatar all called for a cease-fire and for both parties to return to negotiations. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates called on those fighting in Sudan to exercise restraint and work toward a political solution.Former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who was ousted in the 2021 coup, warned of a possible regional conflict if the fighting escalates. “Shooting must stop immediately,” he said in a video appeal to both sides posted on his Twitter account.Cameron Hudson, a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank and a former U.S. diplomat, said the fighting could become wider and prolonged, calling on the United States to form a coalition of regional countries to pressure the leaders of the military and RSF to de-escalate.",[]

In 2011, his friend and colleague David Kato was bludgeoned to death. Mugisha regularly receives death threats.Politicians and religious organizations have fanned anti-gay sentiment and lobbied for harsh legislation, culminating in parliament’s passage last month of a bill that would criminalize even identifying as LGBTQ.“The Ugandan population has been radicalized to fear and hate homosexuals,” Mugisha, 38, told Reuters in an interview outside the capital, Kampala.“If I was 7, 9, 12, 14, I don’t think I would tell anyone I am gay right now,” he said.And yet, Mugisha says he will not give an inch in the face of the new bill, which is awaiting President Yoweri Museveni’s signature.The bill passed with near unanimous support in parliament. If Museveni signs it — as he is widely expected to — Mugisha’s work could land him in jail under a provision that punishes the “promotion” of homosexuality with up to 20 years in prison.But Mugisha said he feels an obligation to fight back on behalf of LGBTQ Ugandans, many of whom have left the country or fled their homes for safe houses since the bill was passed.“I guess I am going to be in trouble a lot, because I am not going to stop,” Mugisha said.The bill also imposes the death penalty for so-called aggravated homosexuality, which includes having gay sex while HIV-positive.Coming outA practicing Catholic typically seen in a blue suit and white shirt, Mugisha had what he calls a normal childhood, going to school and playing soccer in his Kampala neighborhood.He realized he was gay as early as the age of seven but did not start to come out until he was 14. His parents turned to prayer and traditional healers before landing somewhere between denial and acceptance, he said.Mugisha said he encountered no overt hostility from friends about his sexuality, although some kept their distance for fear they would be suspected of being gay themselves.In 2007, Mugisha took over leadership of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), an advocacy group he had earlier joined as an activist.In the following years, he saw a hardening of anti-LGBTQ views, which he attributes to campaigning by ultra-conservative Christian groups, some from the United States.“Homophobia and this whole anti-gay sentiment are Western. They are not Ugandan,” he said.Same-sex relations were first criminalized in Uganda under British colonial rule. Mugisha said historically Ugandans “frowned” upon homosexuality but did not want to harm gay people.Ugandan officials, by contrast, often say LGBTQ rights are a Western imposition.Mugisha’s friend Kato was killed in 2011 months after a local newspaper printed the names, photographs and addresses of him and others in the LGBTQ community and called for them to be hanged.The police said the murder was unconnected to his sexual identity, but Mugisha is certain that it was.He considered leaving Uganda then, but he stayed and led the campaign against a law enacted in 2014 that stiffened penalties for same-sex relations.That law was ultimately voided by the courts on procedural grounds and Mugisha is hoping for a similar outcome this time.“Many people are going to ... challenge this law,” he said. “Looking at this legislation, I do not think it will survive.”",[]

Heavily-armed police put the girlfriend, celebrity doctor Nandipha Magudumana, into a separate white van at the airport.Magudumana was expected to be charged with murder as part of the elaborate jailbreak plot, which involved getting a dead body into the prison where Bester was incarcerated to help him stage his own death in a fire and escape.A prison guard and Magudumana’s father already were charged with murder in connection with the body of a man found burned beyond recognition in Bester’s cell. The unidentified man died of blunt force trauma to the head before the fire, police said.Police and officials from South Africa’s Ministry of Justice confirmed Bester and Magudumana were back in the country and said more arrests were expected.Zolile Sekeleni and Senohe Matsoare appeared in court this week accused of assisting in the escape of Thabo Bester.Gallo Images via Getty ImagesBester was convicted on one count of murder and two counts of rape and sentenced in 2012. He escaped from Mangaung Correctional Centre in Free State province nearly a year ago, when he was formally declared dead by suicide after the fire in his cell.Details were only made public and pieced together in the past three weeks. Critics allege officials intentionally covered up the story.Lawmakers held an hourslong parliamentary hearing Wednesday into security failures that played a role in the breakout. They questioned senior officials from the prison and British private security company G4S, which has a long-term contract to run it.Three prison employees, the night supervisor and two guards who worked in the security camera control room, were fired due to suspicion they helped Bester escape amid the confusion of the predawn blaze in his cell on May 3, 2022.Although one was charged with murder, lawmaker Glynnis Breytenbach said she suspected more guards and officials were bribed to get the body into the cell and help Bester escape.“How many palms were greased?” Breytenbach asked during the hearing. “Are you honestly telling us this escape of Hollywood proportion was done with the assistance of only three people?”The prison and G4S officials conceded under questioning that a TV cabinet big enough to possibly hide a dead body in was brought into the prison in an unauthorized vehicle hours before Bester broke out around 4 a.m. the following morning. Neither the cabinet nor the vehicle was searched.They also said top prison officials gave Bester permission to be transferred to a single-occupant cell three days before his escape. The cell was situated next to a fire exit, which he’s believed to have used to flee.Lawmaker Xola Nqola said it was “not a coincidence” that Bester was moved to that cell.An internal investigation by G4S found the prison’s security camera recording system had a “power interruption” around the time of the escape.Bester was a renowned criminal known as the “Facebook rapist” for using the social media site to lure his victims to meetings. He was found guilty of murder for stabbing his girlfriend, a model, to death in 2011 and raping two other female models.For months after Bester’s escape, he and Magudumana, whom police identified as his “accomplice,” lived in a mansion in a wealthy suburb of Johannesburg, driving luxury cars while running a company that allegedly defrauded businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to media reports.Authorities only announced publicly last month that Bester did not die in his cell and had escaped after South African news organization GroundUp reported that the charred body found in the cell wasn’t Bester’s, according to findings from the autopsy.The news and heightened public interest in the case appeared to have spurred Bester and Magudumana to flee the country. It also produced heavy criticism against authorities for failing to warn the public that a dangerous criminal was on the loose.The parliamentary hearing focused on the initial prison failures and continued Thursday. More hearings were scheduled on what police, the Department of Corrections and South Africa’s Ministry of Justice knew about Bester’s escape and when they found out about it.",[]

A promising model and law graduate, she was 29.Pistorius’ trial was beamed around the world and details of Steenkamp’s death shocked audiences, while the case instantly ended the career of a pioneering sportsman who made history by competing against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics.  A statement from South Africa’s Department of Correctional Services said Pistorius would be considered for parole again in August 2024 and would not be released now because “he did not complete the minimum Detention Period as ruled by the Supreme Court of Appeal.”The Steenkamp family’s lawyer, Tania Koen, said in a statement after the parole board’s decision: “While we welcome today’s decision, today is not a cause for celebration. We miss Reeva terribly and will do so for the rest of our lives. We believe in justice and hope that it continues to prevail.”South African Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius during his murder trial at the high court in Pretoria on May 6, 2014.Mike Hutchings / AFP via Getty Images filePistorius has always maintained that he mistook Steenkamp for a burglar and shot her in error, but he was ultimately convicted of murder. Under South African law he is eligible for release having served half his sentence of 13 years and five months. If Pistorius had been released before the end of his prison term, he would likely have had to wear a security tag and not travel outside of Gauteng Province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria. He would have remained under the supervision of the authorities and attended regular appointments until his entire sentence was finished.Pistorius met with Steenkamp’s father, Barry, in June 2022 as a condition of the parole process. Her family opposed his release because they still don’t believe Pistorius’ account of their daughter’s killing.Her mother, June Steenkamp, attended the hearing on Friday to deliver written and oral statements to the parole board that explained the effect Reeva’s murder has had on their lives. “Unless he comes clean, they don’t feel that he is rehabilitated,” Koen, told reporters outside the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre prison, before the hearing. Pistorius’ protracted trial began in 2014, with two subsequent appeals by prosecutors. The multiple Paralympic champion was initially found guilty of culpable homicide — an offense comparable to manslaughter — for shooting Steenkamp. But in 2015, prosecutors appealed the manslaughter finding and secured a murder conviction. Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp in Johannesburg in 2012.

The Supreme Court of Appeal then increased his sentence to 13.5 years in prison in 2017.“It completely dominated coverage at the time, on every TV, radio station as well as the newspapers, online, social media and so forth,” Glenda Daniels, associate professor of media studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told NBC News. “There was even a whole TV channel devoted to the trial.”There were many layers contributing to global interest in the trial, Daniels said, chief among them Pistorius being “a loved character” in the sports world, locally and internationally, and the celebrity status of the couple.Pistorius was born with a congenital condition that led to both his legs being amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.But he became world-famous for his sporting exploits, leading out the South African team at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, days before becoming the first double amputee to compete against able-bodied athletes at the games. He would go on to reach the semi-finals in the 400m, the distance he specialized in.  As a Paralympian he was a world record holder and world champion.

He said he had been followed, shot at and hi-jacked while living in South Africa and said he was “simply trying to protect Reeva” as he apologized to her family. “I thought that there was a burglar that was gaining entry to my home. Initially I just froze. The first thing that ran through my mind was that I needed to arm myself,” he told the court.",[]
